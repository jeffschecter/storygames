                    I think narrativism is bullshit when used with traditional techniques. This is common but I just Do Not Want. I don't have any problems with a game like Fiasco or <i>Nerver av stål</i> or Microscope. When those kinds of games appeared I thought they were cool.<br/><br/>Playing "Pathfinder with bangs" I think is bull. Adding bangs to a traditional game—and I'd argue that's what Sorcerer does/is—is something that does not sit well with me.<br/><br/>To me the pre-writing / frustrated author GMing style (story "before": gnusto) works best with a game set up around it (like Chuubo's if you want the players to write stories [which is cool], or something like Dread or some shit like that if you want the GM to write stories) and the story NOW (nitfol) goal works best with a game using completely alien &amp; non-traditional techniques.<br/><br/>And by "works best" I don't mean more effective. Not at all. What I do mean is that it's least likely to undermine the glory of blorb and the blorbiness of the gloracle.<br/><br/>Let me try another way: no-one is going to think the GM is railroading you in Microscope (also, there is no GM).<br/><br/>So I'm <i>not</i> saying that most narrativist games are using alien techniques. I am saying that story games that use alien techniques (typically but not necessarily GM-less being one of those techniques) are less threatening to me as a devotee of blorb.<br/><br/>With that said, finding which nitfol techniques work well <i>with</i> blorb without undermining it can enhance a blorb game a lot. There's nothing wrong with giving a couple of opportunities for Addressing some Premise in the sandbox <i>as long as it doesn't come at the expense of the sandbox</i>. It's actually a really nice mix.<br/><br/>The trick to doing two things at once is to decide which of the things matter the most to you and accept that the other thing is compromised. For example, putting mittens on while running down the stairs requires me to keep stair running in my mind in a way that I wouldn't have to do if I wasn't also putting mittens on. Just running down the stairs I don't have to think at all, the body just does it automatically. But also putting mittens, I have to be accepting of the fact that there's an occasional gap or fumble in the mittens-pulling-on because I sure as heckfire don't want there to be one in the stairs-down-running.<br/><br/>And I don't want there to be a compromise in the integrity of blorb.<br/><br/>So for me a super weird &amp; alien game like Fiasco, Microscope, the Skeletons… they stay so far away from blorb (no risk of falling in stairs) so I feel safe with them. A game like Sorcerer on the other hand is like "nooo you're gonna trip &amp; hurt yourself!".<br/><br/>Unless you take care and <b>move all bang-like-stuff through the "sandboxifying queue"</b> that is rolltables &amp; map keys, make them less scripted and more part of the organic world (handing responsibility of introducing them over to the gloracle)—and make them something that the hobos might miss or that maybe don't happen. An example of a fail is in my beloved <i>Lost Mine of Phandelver</i> which is <i>almost</i> the perfect adventure but there is one room where someone is "juuuust about to get killed when the hobos arrive" — rereading the adventure right now, the room description looks innocuous and not "time-sensitive" (the guy is just beaten up &amp; is being interrogated) but my players somehow got the impression that the moment was "scripted" and it wasn't well received therefore. "Deep Carbon Observatory" has this problem too, which is unfair to it; the event generator system for the very first part flows SO naturally into each other, and the choices the players make are so seamlessly integrated, that it feels completely scripted and that there were never any choices in the first place, making it feel like a completely railroaded &amp; therefore crappy sequence. So those are some pitfalls you have to watch out for when working with the bane of all sandbox: "events".<br/><br/>The random rumor table is a very valuable tool to place things like this on.                </div>

                            Amen to that.<br/><br/>You seem to be rejecting what used to be called "vanilla narrativism" on the Forge a million years ago, and I'm fine with that. "Vanilla narr" existed as an evolutionary step, and now that we've developed games with dedicated techniques there's no need to go back to that except to satisfy one's historical curiosity.<br/><br/>And I say that as someone who's quite fond of <i>Sorcerer</i>! But I don't believe I would be able to play <i>Sorcerer</i> any effectively had I not played <i>Apocalypse World</i> before, as well as read through it, it being such a good treatise on how to MC itself (that which no <i>Sorcerer</i> edition or supplement is). And I believe I "get" <i>Apocalypse World</i> thanks to having experienced more compactly designed games before that: had I come to it exclusively from playing <i>Pathfinder</i> adventure paths, who knows what I'd have read into it!<br/><br/>To introduce RPGs to new audiences, or to introduce "story now" play to more "traditional" RPG audiences, I'll keep using tightly designed games such as <i>Follow</i>, <i>Dog Eat Dog</i>, <i>Montsegur 1244</i>, <i>SKEW</i>, <i>Lovecraftesque</i> etc., thank you, and I wouldn't dream of indulging my quirky Sorcerer habit on such occasions. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><small>Actually, I do use a lot of games with a GM role for new-to-RPG audiences too: <i>Psi*Run</i>, <i>Fables of Camelot</i>, <i>On Mighty Thews</i>... But in these games the "GM" has a clear and well-defined (support) role, and I make that more obvious by showing my work all the time.</small> </div>

<p>♥ Thank you Rafu</p><p>I got some follow up Qs in PM and I wanted to clarify/rephrase using some more Forge friendly lingo. Note that I really really prefer to use the RISS model, a model that arose here on story-games itself. By yours truly so ofc I understand it better because anytime something is wrong with it I can just change it.™</p><p>In the Big Model there’s this whole separation of Technical Agenda and Creative Agenda. Something that we’ve been over many times here as well.</p><p>This thread started because I got the question in PMs “Are you suffering under the misconception that Narrativism is all about non-traditional techniques?”</p><p>To which the answer is…<br/>blorbiness is more about technical agenda (thank you to <a href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">@AlexanderWhite</a> for reminding me of this in PMs, I keep forgetting about it) than creative agenda. The whole creative agenda thing isn’t part of the RISS model btw. Maybe RISS cover some of the same ground, maybe it doesn’t.</p><p>I do <b>not</b> like, want, enjoy, endorse, accept, recommend, review highly, appreciate or smile at games that “tread on the toes” of blorb while violating the principles of blorb.</p><p>That leaves two categories of Games Liked By Sandra:</p><ul><li>games that are clearly distinguishable from blorb</li><li>games that adhere to the principles of blorb &amp; gloracle</li></ul><p>So to answer the question, which to remind the audience was: “Are you suffering under the misconception that Narrativism is all about non-traditional techniques?”</p><p>the answer is:</p><p><strong>Good</strong> narrativism is about non-traditional techniques.</p><p>Now, “good” isn’t the same as “all” or even “most” or even “a lot”. I’m aware that games that Rafu reminded me are called “vanilla narr” exist. <small>I just try to not think about them.</small></p><p>Also “good” in this context means liked by Sandra for what that’s worth—not very much possibly!</p><p>To augment this, appreciating some of the things that narrativism thinks are cool, wanting some of that in your game, putting some of that in your game, <em>while never letting it override gloracle, or lead to compromises with blorb</em>, is very cool &amp; something I do myself.</p><p>Things like Premise &amp; Addressing It, things like Theme, things like Moral Choices etc.</p><p>If that happens? Cool! Putting in things that make that more likely to happen? Cool! Giving up blorbiness to enforce it? No, hold on, that’s not me, man, that’s not my bag.</p><p>If you want a game that’s <em>all about</em> that stuff and <em>making absolutely sure</em> that that stuff comes up—that can lead to some very powerful game sessions and I’ve had some absolutely unforgettable experiences. Hey I pay good money to go to fucking jeep larps and junk like that! The key then being <strong>non-traditional techniques</strong> in order to not violate the holy taboos of blorb.</p> </div>

                            So my reco, then, is: play blorb, get really really sharp at making good encounter tables &amp; map keys [I usually, uh, use store bought modules for this because I'm so busy <del>edition warring</del> talking RPG philosophy].                        </div>

                            I feel like a lot of the more hardcore-sandbox-purist advice already tends to acknowledge this? Like, if you don't bite at an adventure hook, then there should be consequences. <br/><br/>If you don't save the princess, someone else does and gets the reward, or maybe the bandits kill her and there's a crisis of succession.<br/><br/>If you don't pacify the upstart cult now, their influence continues to grow and they become a major force.<br/><br/>Adventure hooks might not be bangs in the purest sense, but I suspect if you try to do a narrative sandbox they'd probably end up pulling double duty (they're sort of analogous, aren't they?). And while conventional storygaming wisdom suggests that you should jump at these opportunities because storygaming loves conflict (and maybe also because it inherits some of trad's <i>obligation to play along</i>), perhaps in proper sandbox style the actual bang is/should be the choice to engage or not, and the consequences come from that choice.<br/><br/>I don't know how much that constitutes Real Actual Narrativism though. It feels more like in-character Microscoping almost?<br/><br/>I once saw someone describe the ideal experience of being a bottom (in the sexual sense) as "getting what you want without having to ask for it." I keep coming back to that description a lot when it comes to roleplaying games. It has been my experience that there are a lot of roleplaying bottoms who hate storygaming's/narrativism's tendency to be up front about what you want to see happen, and who cluster around variations of pseudo-sandbox or SIM play or blorby games that are curated to provide a very thin slice of experience.<br/><br/>Anyways the point there (and I apologize if this is one of those things that's so blatantly obvious that nobody ever says it and I just don't realize it) is that sandbox play might not <i>really</i> be about all the procedures and the superficial descriptions of what goes on, as much as it is about that desire to get what you want without having to ask for it. All the superficial dross of the game is just there to obfuscate the workings by which someone else acknowledges that our desires are valid, to soothe the anxiety and guilt we feel over wanting things.                        </div>

And while it’s something that definitely doesn’t square with my <em>own</em> experience [being completly smitten with blorb qua blorb then the “mirror story” happened]; I can see a lot of 90s style illusion being motivated by that feeling you just described. “Man, nothing is happening in our sandbox, I better cheat things so that they do happen.”</p><p>That’s also why I say that the second most common game master mistake is not being able to let time pass. If the characters are doing nothing and they aren’t in a place where they can see what the world is doing, <em>let time pass as quickly as you can</em>. Say “OK, three hours pass and then there’s a knock on the door”, don’t wait for 3 hours at the game table irl. This sounds ridiculous to people who know how to GM without making this mistake but it’s a super common mistake!! If nothing happens for 3 weeks in the game then nothing happens! Just fast-forward to when something does happen. Three years later, here are some signs of how the cult’s influence has grown or whatever.</p> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">@AlexanderWhite</a> sent me a 2018 video that I just finished watching where Ron explains that his prep for Sorcerer is often solid &amp; blorby.

                            So there’s probably a few different families of Narrativism. I’ll describe how my family works and you’ll see why changing the mirror is bad play.<br/><br/>The player needs a character who wants something and has beliefs about how the world works. <br/>The player needs to actually care about this. They must be invested in a preferred outcome or the game is no fun.<br/><br/>The GM also has to care about the character and be invested in a preferred outcome. <br/><br/>If the player has a preferred outcome and the GM has a preferred outcome then guess which outcome will happen?<br/><br/>If you want the story to actually be emergent then:<br/><br/>The player must play with fidelity to character, even when it works against their preferred outcome.<br/><br/>The GM must play with fidelity to (?), even if works against their preferred outcome.<br/><br/>The ? Is of course the world.<br/><br/>Now you can further spike all this by adding dice mechanics and other good stuff. The fact remains that none of that works if there is no fidelity.                        </div>

                            I have a kind of tangential question, but is Fiasco really a narrativist game? I've found in the many times I've played, that it's equally likely to address some premise, as it is not to address anything specific and just imitate the carcass of a movie (like, just play in a superficial layer).                        </div>

You'd think. But this is what I have to deal with:

The map creation is the prep. It's just that everyone is in on it.

I honestly don't see the point in differentiating between "An idea I came up with four days ago" and "An idea I came up with just now".</div></blockquote>
Maybe there was more posted in that thread after I had died of shock after seeing <i>Svart av kval, vit av lust</i> being described as a prepped sandbox game. Unless that was a joke. Well "prepped sandbox" or not, it sure as heckfire isn't a blorb game. (I like it though, it's clearly distinguishable from blorb).                        </div>

                            If it is just prep, why is that thing about making things on the spot being bad? Seems pretty demanding for games with GMs, even more for narrativist game where you must be ready to improvise. Prepped content is all fine, but many time players don't bite your hooks or steer  play in a different direction, which is fine. Is the GM responsibility to prep for every possible branch of the story?                        </div>

It was just an expression written in a hurry. I was talking about the Story Now kind of preparation, but even then, you can't account for all possible places your players might try to visit, even more when running for example urban games where their options aren't constrained like a dungeon or some other natural environments.<br/><br/>But leaving that aside, I don't fully buy in those "musts" about how prep must be done. It seems a very particular style of GMing prep technique that you seem to be broadly applying to games that don't fit in. Especially since you seem to not apply it to the other games you praise, like Fiasco, where every player makes things up... all the session. I know, Fiasco is GMless, but I don't think all games with GM can be dumped into the same bag, and GMs be judged according to the same principles.<br/><br/>With some Story Games, I think the purpose of having those flags defined, is that when making something on the spot, you can tie that thing to one of those flags. For example, in AW, you need to make an NPC on the spot, so you tie them to an existing front, or to an NPC or gang/group that's tied to the PCs. You're still making sth on the spot, but your improvisation is thematically linked to the important content of the campaign.                        </div>

That's fine, but I don't think that's a universal property of games with a GM, more like a must for sandbox or exploratory ones. Do I really want to "discover" a pre-existing world when playing a story now game? How does that mingle with, for example, one use for wises in Burning Wheel, where the player may state as part of their intent a fact about the setting, and then roll to see if it's true? Or, for example, the first session (or first 2 sometimes) in Apocalypse World or Monsterhearts, where mostly the GM will ask the players for details about the scenario in order to make the fronts. <br/><br/>So, how could those games be judged by this specific expectation for GM prep, when in their rules they explicitly go against it several times? I can probably find even more examples, like Circles in BW.                        </div>

                            This isn't addressed to anyone in particular. I find it helpful to talk about what we want in our games and why certain techniques support or don't support that thing. The RISS which I think 2097 is using as a basis for a lot of this discussion definitely does get into that, particularly where it points to where certain techniques step on one another's toes.<br/><br/>But at the same time I still feel like we have a lot more words for techniques than we do for experiences. Sometimes it's hard for me to express what I want from a game because I don't know it until I see it, or even if I know what it is I have a hard time expressing it to someone else.<br/><br/>It's obviously a way more subjective thing than technique but it still seems worth talking about. Here are some phrases that have helped me to understand what folks are striving for with blorby play:<br/>"Holodeck" play &lt;- This is one I've heard 2097 use<br/>"Escape room" play &lt;- Someone else on the internet talked about it this way<br/><br/>There's a particular kind of experience that I call "playing 20 questions with a doorknob" which I really like. So far I can only get this experience through blorby play.                        </div>

Just running down the stairs I don't have to think at all, the body just does it automatically. But also putting mittens, I have to be accepting of the fact that there's an occasional gap or fumble in the mittens-pulling-on because I sure as heckfire don't want there to be one in the stairs-down-running.<br/><br/>And I don't want there to be a compromise in the integrity of blorb.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
I'm super charmed by this metaphor by the way. I can think of a specific campaign where things became more and more glove focused until I ended up in a heap at the bottom of the stairs. I had to beg my group to port our game over to a more glove focused system (read "dungeon world"). I think I've mentioned that before.<br/><br/>And it goes in the other direction too. I sometimes use blorby techniques when I play Trollbabe, but in that case the stairs are the nitfol techniques and the gloves are the blorby ones... I guess what I'm saying is I fall down the stairs a lot.                        </div>

LOL I'm dying<br/><br/>I think part of the trouble I have with games that ride the line is that I have no idea how to set expectations for people I'm playing with. I run Monster of the Week which is a powered by the apocalypse game pretty regularly. I have a really hard time figuring out what the priorities of that game are. But at the same time people seem to love when I run that game. It's excruciating for me though because I can't isolate what they like about it and I don't know what my role is.<br/><br/>Also last weekend I met someone who had played some Delta Green but otherwise didn't have much rpg experience. He told me he wanted to play in an illusionist game straight up, he said he wanted a game (I'm paraphrasing) "where it feels like you have a lot of options but no matter what you choose to do you end up in the right place at the right time and it's a good story". I told him it sounded like the games that I used to run when I was first starting, I called them "dinner theater" games, he said that sounded great. It broke my heart because I don't want to do that anymore. <br/><br/>I ended running Barrowmaze for him and some folks using Knave, does that make me a bad person? I think they had a good time.                        </div>

But it seems to happen to many story now games: for example in AW the first session tends to be weak, since there are no fronts and the GM is mostly gathering information. Coming to that first session with a scenario already prepared would be fine, but also the GM would be building the fronts based on his interests instead of the players' ones, and it might all fall to pieces when players show no interest in your prep (a scenario all too common in trad gaming).                        </div>

Yeah that's definitely a real thing. To be clear I'm actually coming from a place of making things less burdensome for myself. For one thing when I run a blorby game I usually don't <i>make</i> the prep myself, sometimes I do, but a lot of the time I buy it. I like reading modules, it's fun for me. So for me building a sandbox is really just a matter of picking a couple of location based modules with similar tone, adding some connections between them, plopping them down a map, and filling the spaces in between. But if I'm being honest it took me a while to get there, I don't think there are really shortcuts.

I feel this 100%, it's basically what I'm complaining about. I'm choosing to lay it at the feet of the system saying that it should be setting expectations for me. But there's probably a way of setting those expectations myself, it's just hard. Especially when you're playing with people that don't use the same vocab, that's why I was trying to find better words for different types of rpg experiences.                        </div>

I actually consider this to be a major problem with the design of many less... self-aware? PbtA games.

                            Also important to note: there is a big spread/distinction between what Sandra refers to as 'blorb' and 'traditional techniques'. We can have sandbox design in an entirely non-traditional game, and lots (maybe most?) games using traditional techniques are definitely NOT blorb (e.g. Silmenume's "spicy dice" game).<br/><br/>I feel very safe saying that, by Sandra's standards, <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>Apocalypse World</i>, and <i>Dungeon World</i> are not "fully blorby" games (although all can end up featuring a lot of sandboxy GM prep).<br/><br/><b><i>Ultimately, it's really about separating the techniques</i></b> (e.g. traditional mechanics, prepared sandbox, impartial resolution, player narration) <b><i>from the creative goals of play</i></b>. Almost any combination is possible with the right design.<br/><br/>(By the way, I agree that <i>Fiasco</i> is not a particularly Narrativist-supporting game. It's probably possible to get that kind of play out of it, but it certainly isn't "built in", and rarely happens, in my experience, unless everyone at the table is hardcore gunning for that anyway. It's highly non-traditional and can create great stories, but I wouldn't call it an explicitly Narrativist game, nor categorize it that way myself.)                        </div>

A small town, a couple of small dungeons, some rumours, some encounter tables. When you fall back to tier three, you pat yourself on the back, pick yourself up, keep going, and before next session you patch the hole (most often by adding mechanics or tables for this kinda thing). This is a feedback loop that lets you start simple and always keep improving.</p><p>I was playing with a group of newbies a few months ago, I just grabbed the classic “Holy Sword!” one page dungeon and gave them some level 5 pregens. It was gonna be boardgame night and I wasn’t sure if they would be into D&amp;D so I didn’t want to put too much effort in. And then whatever they tried I had a rule for it. (I play Finchian trap-finding style, but plenty of things <em>are</em> rule-driven such as I’ve picked up the Veins of the Earth method of setting climbing DCs.) And they were so impressed at how they could do <em>anything</em> but yet it all had rules and felt solid. Well, because I’ve been in this “feedback loop” of the three tiers of truth and improving over 5 years of play.</p><p>I tried to prep an ACKS sandbox according to the rules in that book and completely bounced off it. I tried rolling up a sandbox according to <a href="https://batintheattic.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-make-fantasy-sandbox.html" rel="nofollow">some of the more ambitious blog posts out there</a>. Completely unpossible. (I’m just too lazy &amp; too busy tripping balls &amp; posting on S-G.)</p><p>Then when the 5e starter set came out, that was perfect. One flimsy little booklet of rules and one flimsy little booklet of sandbox. I see the PHB, the MM, and the DMG as “expansions” to the starter set and the starter set as the core game♥ I was <em>terrified</em> of DMing but man I love those flimsy booklets and those blue dice♥♥♥♥</p><p>Also, I need to augment the three tiers of truth principle with the “wallpaper saliency” principle. It’s 100% fine to improvise things that are mere color. From principles &amp; a feel of the characters and world. “What wallpaper is it in here?” “Oh, it’s torn, they seem to not really care about their abode.” When things become salient, then you can’t improvise those things anymore. For example a spell that lets you teleport through yellow surfaces. Then suddenly you might need a “random wallpaper table”!</p><p>Here’s an example both of the wallpaper saliency principle and of how this “feedback loop” of the three tiers of truth is <em>still</em> ongoing. It’s a path leading forever towards the horizon and I’m <em>still</em> growing and improving as a DM. Most recently a player wanted to know if moss grew here. Normally falls under “wallpaper” &amp; can just be improvised. Buuut I have a house rule where you need to buy spell components for the spell Light, and one of these is moss. So after that session I made rules for whether you could find these components and if so, how much you could find. Etc etc.</p><p>This is also where the “rulings not rules” thing come in. A principle popular in the OSR, one that if it means “decide things on the fly rather than refer to rules” I kinda disagree with, but I’d love it if it meant: <strong>Start simple</strong>, but then <em>save your own rulings</em> so you can refer to them later.</p> </div>

It’s a show. I have a pretty low bar for the quality of play on a show. It would be just as dumb to try to criticize the gameplay on the old Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon. Matthew Mercer is a great guy. SUPER cool.<br/>I’ve watched maybe 20 eps or so of Critical Role; I think I’m up to like ep 16 or so of the second campaign (yes I’m way behind; I just don’t like to watch TV when I have mental health issues, it’s not a good activity for me) and I’ve seen a handful of eps of first campaign.</p><p>Their use of gloriously detailed encounter areas is obv not a good idea (see above). They don’t do full OSR style sandbox play but they let the dice fall where they may &amp; develop the areas where they see the player character’s going. Ryley’s analysis was completely off and was dumb. If I <em>were</em> to judge it, I couldn’t because I don’t know what’s going on in Mercer’s head or behind his screen. And, again, I don’t want to scare people <em>away</em> from blorb, I want to teach them so that they can <em>reach</em> blorb.</p><p>One of my players is a big crit role fan and at first they said “Oh, can’t you do this or this or this thing more like Mercer” and I said “No, I’m gonna do it my style” and then now, a year later, the same player said “Oh, I was watching crit role and it was so annoying how they did this or this or this, I wish they did it more like you” and I was like… <em>yes! vindicated!</em>♥</p><p>Because in the end all you need to satisfy are your own group. Mercer’s cast is happy with him as a DM and he certainly cares about the game and is invested in it and in them.♥♥</p><p>Now, I want there to be more blorby games in the world so I finally can get to play that enchanter noble I rolled up.</p> </div>

The problem is that, by doing the prep before seeing the characters, you'd be erasing/removing most of the fun that Alexander is describing. You'd be actively hurting that game by making it more "blorby".<br/><br/>Consider, for example, how that whole game/story/experience would be undermined if there was no gold or treasure to be found at all. The premise only works because we've connected "Max needs gold for the orphanage" to "he can get gold by facing great danger (in the dungeon)". Take one or the other away, and we've no longer got the awesomeness Alexander is describing.

Oh boy.<br/><br/>At this point, it sounds like you've accepted the truth of your own claim (essentially that blorb = good, and non-blorb = bad, or at least worse) <i>despite evidence to the contrary</i>. <br/><br/>That's a pretty unfortunate position to be in, kind of like a Creation Scientist refusing to look at geological records.<br/><br/>It seems you've elevated your own preferences to a sort of faith-based dogma.

This is a sidenote and not very important to the larger conversation, but this is a fairly significant misreading or misunderstanding of how premise and Narrativism operates. The reason that potentially tautological-sounding premise works in Sorcerer is because <i>everything about the design of the game</i> pushes you further and further towards answering that question in an interesting way.

That's not a "low bar" at all, but quite the contrary. I could see people seeing how exaggerated and central that premise becomes in Sorcerer and assuming that anything lighter and subtler must NOT qualify as Narrativism, which would be a mistake as well.                        </div>

If your point is that you value blorbiness highly, then of course you must be right! Your preferences and your priorities are entirely your choice.<br/><br/>But isn't the whole point of this thread to make the argument that there is actually some kind of problem or issue with Narrativist priorities and "blorb" techniques mixing? <br/><br/>Otherwise, I'm lost!

No, of course not that! <br/><br/>It would be no problem to build a game with non-traditional mechanics that uses blorby prep/sandbox techniques.

Wait... what? He talks about making AW more sandbox? I find it hard to watch those videos (I don't know where you're getting these "idol" ideas!), but that's a topic that's interesting enough that I may try to check that out. Interesting!

</div></blockquote>
Oh, well, that doesn't really matter: for successful Narrativist you need to address the premise. That's the significant part. (I'm not even sure what "having a premise" means if you don't address it; but it definitely wouldn't be satisfying gaming or a satisfying story.)

</div></blockquote>
I think telling a story about a thief named Max who tries to find gold and it turns out there's none to be found could be quite interesting and entertaining. Occasionally, such a twist is warranted. <br/><br/>But it's a question of practicality and repeatability:<br/><br/>What if we had four or five PCs, each with a stated goal or premise, and we failed to address all of them? Keep in mind that this means that each player came to the game hoping to deal with that issue/topic/dilemma, and not a single one was actually brought out in play. Now imagine doing that over and over and over.<br/><br/>Those aren't going to be happy players.<br/><br/>It would be like sending D&amp;D adventurers into a dungeon with no monsters, no traps, and no treasure. I can imagine an unusual, single adventure where that's the case and it's still interesting... but it's not a really a sustainable model for "what you should do when your friends say they want to play D&amp;D with you". They'll be disappointed; it was only the shock value that was making it work in the first place - working against expectations. Once those are no longer the expectations, the "trick" doesn't work anymore.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D players want to fight monsters and collect treasure. Max the thief wants there to be an orphanage, the potential for finding gold, and some scary stuff that he must decide whether to face or not. That's the whole point of the way the player set up that character.                        </div>

                            You've definitely explained that well before, so it's not new material - but perhaps that's the first time Rafu sees that particularly expression of it. I agree that it's good!<br/><br/>And, Sandra, thank you for the link again! I'll have to check that out. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Now, a few minor points:

Very true! However, in a Narrativist game, the desire for blorbiness would be *very low*, so it's unlikely to be a sticking point for anyone. (More to the point, if I'm running a Narrativist game, I'm not going to set up any false expectations of blorbiness.)<br/><br/>We either set out for the get-go that we might compromise the blorbiness, or we find a way to make the premise-addressing emergent, and stick to the blorbiness (as in Alexander's example).
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>“Are you aware, Sondra my dorling, that there actually are narr games that are traditional?”</p><p>That question has been settled by now I hope?

I... think so?<br/><br/>What are our conclusions? What we you trying to learn?

Yeah, exactly right.

Yeah, exactly right. Lots of even great art has simple premises - perhaps "friendship is worth more than money" or something like that.<br/><br/>But roleplaying doesn't have to be "great art" in the first place, so the bar can be far lower. (Consider some children's stories, for example, which have a very simple and obvious moral.)<br/> </div>

                            Ok. Thanks for the advice, I guess, Sandra, but I disagree with plenty of it. I'm currently GMing BW and can't imagine how a table might improve it more than brainstorming with the BITs in mind prior to the session, for example. In fact, I don't fully accept that principle of random generated content &gt; improvised content, the whole thing seems an alien creature imposed over a game that doesn't fit into that school of GMing.<br/>I'll be GMing SwN some day, but again I don't buy that blorb somehow is the standard by which every GMed game must be judged. Seems to me like criticising D&amp;D for not supporting story now play, like we somehow devolved into "these games must ALL do/have X, Y and Z, regardless of their goals", which is a very backwards mindset.
<blockquote>Very true! However, in a Narrativist game, the desire for blorbiness would be *very low*, so it's unlikely to be a sticking point for anyone. (More to the point, if I'm running a Narrativist game, I'm not going to set up any false expectations of blorbiness.)</blockquote>
Thanks.<br/>My experience with story now games is that they tend to be a bit weak while the scenario is being built, and pretty intense afterwards. Some players don't like those first sessions, other ones actively collaborate into it. As usual, it's not an agenda for everybody, the same way not everybody wants to play a sandbox.<br/><br/>To comment on other things written in this thread, how'd a story now game behave if the scenario was created by the GM before even the PCs were, as Sandra prefers? In Torchbearer and BitD (is BitD story now?), I've found it works mostly alright, if the dungeon in the first case is used as a half painted canvas that's completed with BIG related content.<br/>For Apocalypse World or BW? Not so much, unless even the PCs are pre generated, and the players agree to play that scenario (like a one shot, for example).                        </div>

<br/><br/>A HYPOTHETICAL<br/><br/>Me and my Narrativist friend are playing D&amp;D5E. I make a thief charlatan. <br/><br/>I choose a few things from the charlatan TIBF list.<br/><br/>Scam: I put on new identities like clothes. <br/>(T) I lie about almost everything, even where’s no good reason too. <br/>(I) I never target people who can’t afford to lose a few coins. <br/>(B) A powerful person killed someone I love, someday soon I’ll have my revenge. <br/>(F) I can’t resists a pretty face.<br/><br/>Now that’s not great for Narrativist play. We need to tweak stuff before we start. We want a kicker/inciting incident. Related to the (B) seems strongest. So we’ll start by creating the powerful person and what the kicker is. We need to make it urgent, so let’s say it’s a Prince and I’ve learnt that he’s on a diplomatic mission for two weeks, somewhere close. He’ll be less well guarded than when he’s at his palace at home.<br/><br/>That’s strong but now we need an actual personality. (T) is weak. No good reason? that’s bullshit. We need to rewrite. I lie about almost everything because if people knew the real me they would use it against me (people are mostly scum).<br/><br/>That plays into the (I) in an interesting way as well. People might be mostly scum but I’m not.<br/><br/>I also use my lies to get pretty people into bed with me. That says something interesting about how my character views sex and love. Oh, but my lover was killed (B), maybe he was the only person I could be honest with. <br/><br/>So that sounds like a good character. We begin play, the GM has no prep.<br/><br/>The starting situation is that I’m broke and I live in a large city<br/><br/>Very first thing the GM asks: <br/><br/>GM: What do you do?<br/><br/>Player: I’m going to run a confidence game on one of the nobles. I need that money and I need it quick, to get my revenge. Yet they need to be able to loose a few coin. So I’m going to scout out my contacts, ask around, find someone I’d be comfortable conning out of their cash.<br/><br/>GM: (notices a good opportunity for a roll) ok I’ll roll your trait in secret and record the result.  (The GM rolls and it’s a failure. He decides the charlatan will find someone who appears they can lose a few coin, but on deeper inspection they can’t)<br/><br/>At this point the player go back and forth describing the con and all that good stuff. It takes maybe a week to set up and we get to know the various characters more. Then this happens:<br/><br/>GM as the Noble: I really hope this scheme works. It looks like I’ve got a lot of money but it’s all show really. My father spent the majority of the family fortune a decade ago.<br/><br/>GM: What do you do?<br/><br/>(just to spell it out. The thief is caught between two values and must now chose one. If he stops his con, then he’s lost his chance at the money and makes his revenge far harder.)<br/><br/>A QUESTION<br/><br/>In the above scenario the GM decided that the noble ‘couldn’t afford to lose a few coins’ as the result of a dice roll.<br/><br/>If there had been no roll and the GM just decided it on the spur of the moment, would that matter?<br/> </div>

Is it different? Yes. Would I want to be part of that game? No. Would a non-zero amount of Story-Games posters (that aren't me) accept being part of that game? Yes.                        </div>

We're trying to figure out what you meant by that. If what you meant was, "I don't like gaming that's 'non-blorb'," then there's really nothing to discuss, any more than if I started a thread announcing that I really like cheddar cheese.<br/><br/>Help us out?                        </div>

                            I also want to get back to the <i>Critical Role</i> example, because I think it's highly relevant here. You seem to want to paint everything in terms of "good" and "bad", which makes it difficult to have these discussions, but I'd encourage you to get away from value judgements and just look at what's happening dispassionately. I'm not trying to saying anything is good or bad; just <i>to formulate a good description of what's happening</i>.<br/><br/>It seems to me that <i>Critical Role</i> is a good exemplar, because you and I are both familiar with it, it can be referenced specifically (down to particular moments of play!), and Mercer has made videos explaining what he's doing. (Not in great depth, in my opinion, but there are some clues there as to how he's running the game.)<br/><br/>You've said that "narrativism is bullshit when used with traditional techniques", and that, therefore, you only like it or accept it (?) in a game which is so obviously non-traditional that "blorb" qualities and techniques couldn't possibly be relevant (e.g. <i>Fiasco</i> is a single session game with no GM and no possibility for prep).<br/><br/>I'd like to posit that some non-zero portion of <i>Critical Role</i> (and, arguably, many of the best/most memorable/touching moments) are Narrativist, or at least look similar enough to Narrativism that we can use them as an example.<br/><br/>Clearly, I think:<br/><br/>* <i>At least some</i> bits of play are hitting a potential Narrativist payoff.<br/>* The techniques of play, as well as the mechanics, are entirely traditional.<br/>* [Slightly more debatable] The game isn't being run according to "blorb" principles (or, at least, not to Sandra standards, nor mine).<br/><br/><i>[EDIT: Replaced the character names from the below with made-up names to protect the spoiler-sensitive.]<br/></i><br/>If we accept at least the two first premises above, can we imagine a version of <i>Critical Role</i> that is entirely focused on the sort of emotional payoff that occurs in premise-heavy moments? Where those high emotional stakes moments are the thing that all the participants are trying to create and pursue? "Gundarf defeats the Evil Duke, but doesn't kill his sister, giving her freedom and forgiveness despite her betrayal of the family"... or this quote from a commenter: "Each of those moments were emotional and powerful, but...this moment was beyond words. I couldn't agree more with Colville, Frobdug's decision was the climax of the story, and I was tearing up alongside Sam" - and THAT is why everyone involved in the game is coming to the table every week. It doesn't seem like a stretch to me.<br/><br/>In that hypothetical game (I don't want to assume anything about how the players <i>actually</i> feel about their real, actual game), we would have a Narrativist agenda being pursued with entirely traditional techniques. All the participants seem to be enjoying every bit of it, as well. In what way would that be "bullshit"? Where would you see the breakdown (or potential breakdown)?<br/><br/> </div>

                            I think it's worth revisiting Ron Edwards' take on this, in the essay "Setting and Emergent Stories." The essence of the procedure that he suggests is to focus on a specific location within a broader setting, create characters who belong to and connect with that location, and let play be driven by the player 's efforts in response to the social, political, cultural, and similar tensions that matter to them. Arguably, he's suggesting that play begin where many traditional D&amp;D games wind up: with characters embedded in a specific location, doing stuff that matters there.                        </div>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I don't really understand your issue with discussing <i>Critical Role</i> - I have no interest in judging anything as good or bad here, so I have no idea why you think I'm expecting you to "rag on Critical Role". <br/><br/>It's just a perfect and well-known example of what you started this thread by saying it was 'bullshit', and you still haven't said why or how. Can we imagine a game that's very much *like* Critical Role, but with different people involved and, perhaps, more clarity on the Narrativist angle, and discuss that? It really isn't about the specifics of Critical Role, but about the exemplar of a game run with traditional techniques which could pursue a Narrativist agenda, which you seem to be really against but refuse to tell us why or how it could be a problem.<br/><br/>I'll edit out the spoilers, though; that's a good idea.<br/><br/>As for the Colbert video, it has nothing to do with this thread, but I'll make it easy for you - I think you'll find it interesting example for your "remapping" interest - watch from 15:00 exactly to 18:00. I brought it up there specifically because the example is so short, and I had fun reenvisioning it with our "HP spend" and "players roll to defend" ideas (which I think would be a major improvement).<br/><br/>On blorb (though you're not answering my questions at all on this point):

They are awesome for a narrativist game.<br/><br/>That's why I'm encouraging narrativists to go blorb but if they do, to go <i>wholly</i> blorb or else they'll have incoherence.<br/><br/>If addressing the premise is your <i>NUMBER ONE GOAL</i> then you might run in into trouble if that makes you want to compromise blorb. (Stair running analogy.)<br/><br/>If addressing the premise <i>GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS OF BLORBINESS</i>, given the physicality, given the consequence engine, given the gloracle, is your goal then you're bang on target pal                        </div>

                            Oh yes, this begins to look like the more general "constructive seriousness" : once something is posited, it will be used consistently. <br/>I don't see the priorities though. Exploring a theme while keeping within a certain aesthetical horizon are never antagonist. One is like a force (function), the other like a form (structure).<br/>Blorb is just another aesthetic frame for me. What makes it different from, say, realism ? Or maybe you mean not aesthetic realism (a story in a world where harm hurts and don't forget people work, too). In any case, it's not ontological realism (the things in play don't really exist by themselves outside of our imagination). But maybe <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> you'd like that it it should be possible to believe that the mirror could be real / is real in some other way. Something like that ?

Why not just have the GM constantly describe outcomes that lead to the most intense and dramatic situations?</p></div></blockquote>
I really think it's a question of taste, both in play and in design.<br/><br/>The short version is that sometimes you want the dramatic outcome to be a certainty, whereas sometimes there are two or more dramatic outcomes possible, so it can fun to have a way to decide between them. Each game design (and I'm including GM tools like this in the idea of the "System" operating at the table) will make different choices and prioritize different things.<br/><br/>In Narrativism-supporting designs, in particular, the dice are often used to create opportunities for the players to pursue their characters' goals (and to prevent other players, like the GM, from simply refusing those). In AW, for instance, the design of the moves allows for a chance of success in various fictional situations that a bad GM might otherwise refuse; the effects of that on long-term play are quite dramatic.<br/><br/>I remember many years ago someone asked if it was even possible to write a Narrativist "adventure", since the story was supposed to evolve in play. (At that point in time, there was no "OSR movement", and so pretty much all the "written adventures" people we familiar with had a linear progression from one scene to the next - that was the state of the art and the industry standard.)<br/><br/>So, how would you make a Narrativist scenario, without pre-determining what the story would be?<br/><br/>No one had done that yet, so someone decided to step and produce an example. I believe it was called "Well of Souls", and it was formatted as a relationship map, with each NPC having different desires and goals. There were two important nobles who could have been responsible for a death (I think it was a death; something significant and dramatic, anyway) at the heart of the scenario.<br/><br/>The GM was instructed to follow the flow of play and see what was going on, and then react accordingly by having her NPCs act and react to developing events: "once the game starts, simply play your NPCs!"<br/><br/>Then the scenario did something really weird: <i>it didn't tell you which of the two was responsible</i>. <br/><br/>I thought this was incredibly bizarre. What's the point of writing a detailed, in-depth scenario, and then leaving out the most important piece?!? It was so jarring.<br/><br/>They then explained that, as you played, you could eventually reveal that whichever of the two was the most interesting/emotionally nuanced character was responsible for the murder.<br/><br/>This was a new and very different approach to prepping for a game I'd never encountered before. It's a very interesting technique!<br/><br/>It was quite a mind-expanding exercise to try to wrap my mind around this "heretical" approach to prepping a scenario.<br/><br/>I generally prefer to have things settled beforehand (a la blorb), but sometimes this can be just the ticket (e.g. I determine that someone is poisoning the well in the village in session 1 - maybe because a player authored that detail, and we'll figure out who did it later, in prep for session 4).<br/><br/>In any case, I would never simply write off such a tool, instead adding it to my bag of tricks: for some people, it might be just the thing they prefer. For some game designs, it may be just the thing (because it's a one shot and no one preps). For some play situations, it might be perfect. And if some people out there are having fun playing with such a tool, who am I to tell them that they're doing it wrong? That makes no sense to me. Unlike, say, railroading, I see no bad social ramifications or broken promises nor the potential to ruin the game in any way.<br/><br/>Some game designs will demand this in places, as well. Particularly in games where authorship is distributed in various ways (whether subtly or not soo subtly), it is either impossible or undesirable to prep particular material. Likewise, in other designs, the room to prep something explicitly might be *right there*, despite the other features of the game:<br/><br/>As the opposite experience, we recently played <i>Witch</i>. That game is heavily improvised and collaborative, GMless, with no 'traditional' techniques at all. However, the player of the Witch is instructed to write down the guilt or innocence of the Witch at the beginning of the story and then to seal their choice in an envelope.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the envelope is opened and we find out the truth. That, in turn, informs the endgame and the eventual fates of the characters. It's a lovely use of a "blorb" technique in one of the least "blorby" games ever written! And it works perfectly in that context; take that away and <i>Witch</i> would be a far poorer game.<br/><br/>I'm all for experimenting with such hybrids and crossovers and picking the tool you need at the right time.

I think that playing in a Narrativist style with entirely traditional techniques can be really difficult, awkward, and can very easily produce incoherent play. You're absolutely right.<br/><br/>However, to say that it "doesnt' work at all" or never works is foolish; you'd have to conclude that Narrativist play <i>didn't exist at all until 10 or 15 years ago</i>. <br/><br/>This is a silly proposition, since people have doing it since the inception of the hobby (and the concept of Narrativism was invented to describe a kind of play they were already doing, not some hypothetical thing to try in the future).<br/><br/>More importantly, that ignores the reality of the matter, which is that there is a spectrum of techniques and application such that any game can have a mixture of traditional and non-traditional techniques; Sandra's game has Hillfolk mechanics in it, Deliverator's D&amp;D game includes story game-like 'TIBFs' and Dungeon World-derived XP mechanics, etc, etc. This conversation started in the first placebecause Sandra was explaining her disinterest or dislike for Sorcerer, due to its traditional design. That game is clearly non-traditional enough that it got labeled a "story game" when it was written by many, though! (I also dislike some overly traditional aspects of Sorcerer, but I would never say it's "bullshit" or "makes for incoherent play" when so many people have had tremendously enjoyable play with those rules (see the links I posted in the "things to read on Story Games thread"; and a bunch of us here on Story Games just played Sorcerer for the first time last year and had a great time with it.)                        </div>

This confuses me a great deal. I don't understand how you can make all those statements in the same post. To the point of being completely lost, frankly.<br/><br/>Are Narrativism and "blorb" opposites in your mind, and mutually exclusive? <br/><br/>If so, you're asking "Narrativists" to stop playing the way they like and to switch to a different playstyle (since going "full blorb" is going to replace their primary creative goal).<br/><br/>If they are not opposites, but, instead, can support each other, then why this thread? Isn't your whole point that they are incompatible here ("bullshit", more specifically)?<br/><br/>(Or are you separating "blorb" and "traditional techniques" into completely different corners, and expecting "Narrativists" to adopt blorb but stay away from "traditional techniques"? That sounds odd, as well.)<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: Rereading your post, it makes a little more sense than it did at first. However, there is still the issue that the very definition of "Narrativist" is that "addressing premise is YOUR NUMBER ONE GOAL", and your advice to that person is make it no longer your number one goal. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm not sure what to do with that, nor have you explained why there might be incoherence if they do so. I've played dozens of games where this happens consciously, and it's never ruined anything ("Hey, did you say that Dante was his cousin?" "No, I don't think so." "But it would totally make sense, and improve the dramatic stakes. Can we say that Dante was his cousin all along, retcon that?" "Sure!"). I'd never do that in a "full blorb" game, unless it was irrelevant to the creative goals of play (like "wallpaper" in your analogy).                        </div>

Yeah, that's a great example of how solid prep and the address of premise can support each other.<br/><br/>I think something like <i>Critical Role</i> showcases at least some aspects of that really well.

Alexander, are you familiar with Apocalypse World?<br/><br/>It's a good thought experiment here (which I've actually seen some OSR devotees engage in!):<br/><br/>What if the choices made under the umbrella of any given move were randomized, instead of chosen by the player?<br/><br/>There are many, many situations in AW where you're asked to choose from a list. How would the game be different if, in every one of those cases, you rolled, instead?<br/><br/>Consider that in the MC's choice of moves. Consider that when picking from lists for character creation. Consider that when "choosing 2" from a player-facing move. Consider that for deciding which Front to introduce. Consider that for scene framing.<br/><br/>I think looking at it this way opens one up to possibilities for both play and design (and shows us how and why we might pick one in one circumstance and another in a different place).                        </div>

                            We weren't reading the modules because we weren't using modules, but we were all on the same page about the scenario. The GM's prep was shared completely with the group, to make sure that everyone knew what they needed to do, and make sure they were opting in. Also, to make sure that the GM had prepped the right content for the characters, since we've always played in a deeply character-focused style. <br/><br/>I guess that's sort of the same thing as reading modules; it's just a module written by the GM instead of a published one.

                            I also find it kind of interesting to think about how much the way we used to do that is somewhat still intact in our scene framing. The whole thing of one participant telling the others what they do in the scene, what they need from them to tell the story of the scene. It's just players giving directions to each other with in-depth collaboration on the initial rails rather than a GM giving the directions and writing the rails herself.                        </div>

                            What we did for Corsair Council, which was a game with drama goals but that tried to be wholly blorby (using D&amp;D as a physics layer including the super complicated weather tables from AD&amp;D 2e with the Golden Voyages expansion), was that we would take turns (the Hillfolk scene structure) and the DM (me, that is) would ask that player who they were with. Who did they go to see? And usually it <i>was</i> reasonable for them to go see them in that place, or the first couple of places they looked. I.e. if you know someone went home to sleep last night, usually you can find them in their own place the next morning. If they weren't there they paid a token to "duck the scene" as per Hillfolk p 23.                        </div>

A great example of something I would put the kibosh on!<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> to clarify what I <i>would</i> do: I've ran games where the motive has been color (wallpaper saliency principle) and I've ran games where the motive has been vital (tier one or tier two truth—I've played with a random motive table).                        </div>

Given that you don’t need to use any dice to get a nice dramatic decision point. Why do you use dice? Why not just have the GM constantly describe outcomes that lead to the most intense and dramatic situations?</p></div></blockquote>
You're conflating 2 different things and making them look like they're the same. I've been mostly talking about tables and randomness to generate setting content. I think that's fine, but by no means a priority for every game. Using dice for conflict resolution is another thing, which I also like. Some narr games don't use it, but I mostly like some randomness when it comes to conflicts. The potential I see in it is that sometimes players just want their characters to solve a conflict the easiest way possible (avoiding a dilemma or hard choice, for example). Here, the dice bring the setting and genre constraints that lead to some hard choices on behalf of the player. Externalizing this to dice makes it easier for me, the GM, and less predictable. Sometimes characters will actually avoid making a hard choice and just, I don't know, start the revolution without spilling blood.<br/><br/>Regarding your example, I don't know what that "roll a trait" means in D&amp;D5th. But in my mind, your example is conflict resolution with an explicit intent stated by the player, which means I would never resolve it by rolling on a random table. In BW, I'd have him roll Circles to find a suitable noble to be conned, a roll where the player gets full use of their resources to affect the outcome, unlike a random table.<br/><br/>Imagine the player just said this, you go on and roll on a table to generate the noble, and find out he's deeply in debt. Why have you presented him an NPC that's useless to his purposes? Why don't the PC social skills factor in the noble he'll get to con? Will he have to skip that noble for you to keep rolling on that table until he finds someone suitable? For me, a Circles roll summarizes that whole process in a way where the result is relevant to the intent the player has, in a way that's connected to the PC skills rather than fully random.<br/><br/>As a side note, I'd make the roll in the open. I don't see the value in hiding a roll from the player, but that's just me.                        </div>

What I've been reading is that she states that every game with a GM should be blorby because she says so, and that games like BW or AW, which never in their book mention "blorb" or anything related, don't work as Story now games because having a GM produced incoherent play, unlike other, non traditional narr games like Fiasco (which is not a story now game, so my impression here is that all this thread is about misunderstanding what story now actually is). <br/>So, to summarize, Where in those games an adherence to blorb is stated, and if it isn't, how is it justified? Or, to take it further, why every game with GM has to be blorby? Why can't players deal with a hybrid distribution of responsibilities, like they have for almost a decade or more? <br/>I'd actually root this discussion in actual play examples where these games supposedly produce incoherent play, rather than keep it in the air, because I just can't see the consequences of unblorbiness and I need concrete examples.
<blockquote>all traditional roleplaying games should be wholly blorby.</blockquote>
This needs to be proved first. It can't just be stated.                        </div>

                            I'm reading the word "blorb" as meaning something like what some OSR gamers call "world in motion." The idea is that an internally consistent and causally coherent in-game universe is presented to players, who are thereby able to more easily imagine that the game-world has an independent existence. A concomitant of this is the precept that the GM is the medium through which information about the world is transmitted to players. What I hear Sandra calling for is a commitment on the part of the GM to devise information about the world in line with a scheme that privileges pre-planned info, masks the character of procedurally generated info, and deprecates the value of off-the-cuff invention. The benefit of this approach, as far as I can tell, has to do with the coherence of the fictional setting. This seems in Forge terms to be pure Right to Dream of Setting/System--where the setting and the system are really intertwined. It's an interesting approach; I wonder about the role or function of the player in it.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Bill,<br/><br/>In Forge terms, a “blorby” approach allows the GM to act as much as possible as an objective referee, adjudicating impartially and having a clean, repeatable and unbiased process for establishing the facts of the world/adventure/environment. This means relying on objective techniques which take the GM’s judgment out of those decisions. (This is, obviously to me, an impossible goal, but striving towards can make a big difference in play style.)<br/><br/>When the GM is operating in this way, it frees up the players to pursue a Step On Up agenda against the backdrop of established facts and impartial adjudication. If you make a plan to use a magic mirror to trap a demon, it works because you correctly ascertained the function of the mirror (because it was objectively determined and/or prepped), making the success of your plan based on your luck or ingenuity, not the subjective judgment of the GM. That makes for real loss and victory conditions in a way that a GM deciding which it was after the fact simply does not.                        </div>

Exactly right. <br/><br/>Here's an example case:<br/><br/><i>Critical Role</i> is a fun and popular game enjoyed by thousands of people, both players and audience members. <br/><br/>It is also very clearly not blorby (at least not by your standards or mine, Sandra).<br/><br/>It would be the height of arrogance for us to overlook the people enjoying it and claim that it is inferior and that it should be changed. <br/><br/>Or, we'd have to prove why it's not really as fun as it seems in some way. That's a major hill to climb!
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>"I disapprove of how you play but I will defend to the death of blorb your right to play it?"<br/><br/>But I love blorb, how can I even accept the death of blorb?</p></div></blockquote>
Basically, yes. <br/><br/>There is no need for blorb to “die”! You already acknowledge that there are playstyles which do not involve blorb, just like there are pizzas without tomato sauce: there’s no contradiction there! <br/><br/>In addition, there is or more point of difference:<br/><br/>In play with a Narrativist priority, there is no need for strict blorb. It is, by definition, not the priority. Some blorbiness can be really nice, but it doesn’t make or break the game.<br/><br/>(To show otherwise, you’d have to come with an example of how a failure to use blorb methods in a Narrativist game led to problems and people failing to address premise and enjoy themselves. That’s what would begin to convince me there’s something to talk about - until then, we’re just talking about we like or dislike.)<br/><br/>There are also significant advantages to non-blorby play, which are sometimes desirable for just about any game style. (E.g. witness the popularity and success of something like Lady Blackbird.) <br/><br/> </div>

Exactly. (Sandra will undoubtedly say that she "gets a charge" from seeing the gloracle in operation, but I'm quite confident that's not the actual creative payoff of the game - or, even it was for Sandra, it wouldn't be for other people using the same techniques - we've had lots and lots of conversations about that earlier and even ran a bit of a Story Games online campaign using those techniques. In theory, "blorb" can be used as a technique in any mode of play, but, in practice, it's most often used to facilitate a Step On Up agenda, which is why it needs to be adhered to *strictly* - as you can imagine, given a different creative agenda, there wouldn't likely be any need for it to be so strict.)<br/><br/>I can <i>imagine</i> a group purely enjoying the "gloracular Machine in operation" as their main creative goal, but I doubt very many people do. Sandra's game uses D&amp;D adventure modules, for example, as a large component of play - it wouldn't make much sense to do that in a game which is purely interested in Exploration of that sort, I think.                        </div>

Some people do. Sandra mentioned earlier that she does, and I think my own preferences overlap quite a lot with a kind of pure respect for blorb, particularly in games where the gloracle is an unwieldy, caterwauling behemoth constantly threatening to careen off a cliff.<br/><br/>There's a certain subset of rules lawyers and min-maxers (I think) who aren't really looking to game the setting <i>in order to win</i>, or at least for whom Stepping On Up is secondary to simply plunging into the depths of the system to see just how far it can go (for example, it's unlikely you will ever use a Great Cleave "teleport" to actually circumvent a challenge; it's just fun to imagine the wave of gore that follows in your wake as you break the sound barrier). These players are more like Johnnys in Magic the Gathering parlance, who use the game as a vehicle of "creative expression." It's just that most games that have a lot of support for this <i>also</i> happen to be firmly Step On Up. I suspect a lot of people who prefer GMing these sorts of games also have a lot of overlap with this profile.<br/><br/>I've personally taken to calling this style of play Mousetrapping, after the Milton Bradley boardgame where watching the game's Rube Goldberg device namesake in action is by almost any measure far more interesting than actually "playing" the game. It's not exactly the same as pure, unsullied blorb-love but it heavily relies on the precepts of blorb.                        </div>

                            So <a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a> I've got an actual play example from when I was running a one shot of Monster of the Week for strangers at the mall yesterday. I realize I already complained about MotW in this thread, but I think the situation I'm describing could have come up in an Apocalypse World game as well. I'm not a master class GM so there might be other issues going on here (and I'm totally interested in suggestions), but I felt like there were some competing expectations that came from having "harm" as part of the system. If it feels nitpicky and weird I'm sorry.<br/><br/>One of my guiding principles when I run anything non-blorby (which is pretty frequent) actually comes from the introduction of Dogs in the Vineyard: <blockquote>[...] if you're the GM, feel free to tell the players things their character's can't know. "You cut out across the field towards the smoldering wagon. There's a gang of robbers hiding in the grass and behind a couple of nearby trees. You haven't seen them yet. What do you do?"</blockquote> That was a big deal for me when I first read it, and I use it a lot when running Trollbabe even though examples in that text explicitly contradict it. Without it I feel like players decisions for there characters have less impact because I have too much power to effect the stakes after they've already made a decision.<br/><br/>Ok here's the background for the example: The monster hunters are at a teenage dance party in the woods where they have just started playing a CD that turns anyone who listens to it into a demon possessed serial killer. Kai (a PC who is half fae) and her cousin Erris (NPC who is fully fae) run up through the crowd to the stage just as everyone is turning into psycho killers. Kai gets caught up in a fight before she gets to the stage but Erris actually makes it up onto the stage and grabs the disk. Just as she gets the disk though, Joel (her boyfriend now possessed by demon music) grabs her and is about to stab her with a knife so she throws the disk to Kai (the actual PC) who runs to try and catch it. Across the field Earnest (another PC who is Erris' ex lover) levels his gun and tries to shoot Joel before he can stab Erris.<br/><br/>Ok here's the part that got a little weird: So I had set up this Joel is about to stab Erris situation which I guess was a soft move. The PC Earnest wants to shoot Joel both because he's trying to save Erris and also because he really hates Joel. I decide this sounds more like Act Under Pressure rather than Kick Some Ass. Earnest get's a 7-9 result which means "the Keeper is going to give you a worse outcome, a hard choice, or price to pay." I tell Earnest's player that if he shoots he will hit Joel but the bullet is going to hit Erris too. We can argue about whether that was a good "price to pay" or not but it's what I chose. Earnest decides to pull the trigger, there's a bang, and Joel and Erris fall off the stage.<br/> <br/>Now the problem: The phrase "the bullet is going to hit Erris too" feels like it should have an established meaning in the game because we have this harm system, but as Earnest is walking over to Erris I still have no idea whether she's A. basically fine (she's fae after all) B. in dangerous condition C. dead. I know I can't pick C. because part of Joel's declared intent was to save her. But about the other two? Monster of the Week just tells me pick whichever one sounds better (bottom of pg. 213). <b>I'm not saying there's anything wrong with making the decision on those terms, but it also means I should have made that decision earlier and told Earnest's player what the stakes were before he pulled the trigger.</b> And maybe that's where this example ends since I've clearly identified my mistake. But at the same I'm just wondering if the system could have helped me more here. For the record I picked B. which in retrospect feels like both the worst narrative decision (Erris is probably already mad at Earnest for shooting her even if she's more or less uninjured, and that's a more interesting consequence to me) and also the most like I'm playing "gotcha" with the players. It was the end of a very long session with no breaks so we all just went and got dinner after that. Earnest's player didn't complain to me about the outcome exactly but he seemed pretty dissatisfied (I was too).<br/><br/>But also Monster of the Week is basically a straw doll in this regard. The equivalent passage in Apocalypse World is much more interesting (honestly it has reignited my love for AW as a system) but still seems like it has an issue for me. Here's the description of what happens when an NPC takes 2-harm:
<blockquote>wounds, bad pain, broken bones, shock. <b>Likely</b> fatal, <b>Occasionally</b> immediately fatal.</blockquote> (bolding is my emphasis)<br/>The above is followed by:
<blockquote>If you don't like deciding arbitrarily, you can roll for it. Consider all the probability words above in d6 terms, trying to roll high: "generally" and "likely" mean on a 2-6; [...] But I think you can decide just fine for yourself if you want to.</blockquote>
I honestly think that's awesome in some ways, but I also think it still points to the issue <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> is highlighting. If the player has no gaurantee as to whether the GM will incorporate the gloracle into the decision or not then the gloracle loses all it's magic for setting expectations and seems kind of incoherent. I feel like the gloracle could make Earnest's decision to shoot or not shoot Erris a lot more interesting, but only if it's incorporated correctly.<br/><br/>I actually still have a lot of hope for all of the above though and I'm really interested to hear people's thoughts on this. <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> seems to be suggesting that the gloracle and prep should be used for everything but the "wallpaper" as the solution, and I think that works. But I wonder if we were explicit about which outcomes were under the domain of the gloracle and which weren't if we could capture some of the gloracle/blorby magic while still leaving wiggle room in other places. This got pretty long winded so sorry about that.                        </div>

A concomitant of this is the precept that the GM is the medium through which information about the world is transmitted to players.</p></div></blockquote><p>Nodding along…</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" rel="nofollow">Bill_White</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What I hear Sandra calling for is a commitment on the part of the GM to devise information about the world in line with a scheme that privileges pre-planned info, masks the character of procedurally generated info, and deprecates the value of off-the-cuff invention.</p></div></blockquote><p>Yes, that’s the method♥</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Ron in video" rel="nofollow">Ron in video</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>…the components that you’re working with, that you have brought, are extremely solid and extremely assertive, and therefore what is unknown is the nature of the reactions—which reactions, and the nature of them, and most particularly the activity after that.</p></div></blockquote><p>From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC2L14X6ORo" rel="nofollow">this video, Emergent plot techniques</a>.

And also that’s REALLY bad form of you pushing me so hard on this topic. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23emo2097&amp;Mode=like">#emo2097</a> Unlike you, my real name–Sandra Snan–is out here on Story Games. If someone misunderstands me as not liking this beloved-by-millions TV show… I don’t want that to happen. I think a lot of things about the show is great. And Mercer is an absolute sweetheart who I really admire in many ways.</p><p>The things I personally like the most about them and that as far as I understand most fans &amp; participants like the most of them, judging from how they get selected and put into “best of”-clips and similar, are either things that <em>are</em> wholly blorby [moments when the events are extremely emergent rather than pre-planned], or wholly orthogonal to blorb. There’s nothing unblorby about the characters and their interactions.</p><p>The things that I don’t like, and the Colbert episode (like the Vin Diesel episode before it) has a clearer example of this than anything I’ve seen on the CR show proper, is when I suspect that there is unblorbiness going on behind the scenes; when I suspect illusiory techniques. Spoiler warning for the Colbert episode: the way it ended seemed very “paced as a story” and not emergent, which <strong>if true</strong>, is to me not taking advantage of the medium of a roleplaying game.</p><p>So some <em>important</em> caveats to that.</p><ol><li>That ending <em>could</em> happen. I don’t know or care about how Mercer runs his games. Unless you practice radical transparency of method, it’s hard to see to what extent <em>any</em> given game complies with the blorbiness decree. Blorb happens at the engine level, not on the surface level.</li><li>“Medium of roleplaying game”; but that Colbert TV show <em>is</em> also a show. It has to comply with the expectations of two mediums at once; possibly compromising one or both of them. (That doesn’t mean I think compromising blorb is heartwarming.)</li><li><strong>I don’t want to gatekeep specific GMs</strong> as saying “you’re doing it wrong”; I want to <strong>teach blorb</strong> because I believe it can <em>improve</em> their games, not because I want to lord it over them, be smug over them, say that they’re bad or w/e. I learned this lesson in the worst way during TitansGrave.</li><li>Advice shows! When someone like Mick Ryley or Matt Colville puts himself up as <em>the</em> DM teacher number one and teaches pure &amp; evil anti-blorb, that’s something I <em>do</em> take issue with. Mercer’s own advice show, that I didn’t watch a lot of, seemed very humble and polite and vague by comparison.</li></ol><p>Back in the Critical Role thread, <strong>I</strong> was the one who was all gung-ho and “Leave Britney alone!” when several posters here were criticizing the show in a very patronizing way.</p> </div>

Blorb sets the stage and grounds the whole thing in a way that makes it unlike any story or fiction. It becomes an experience.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>To show otherwise, you’d have to come with an example of how a failure to use blorb methods in a Narrativist game led to problems and people failing to address premise and enjoy themselves.</p></div></blockquote><p>You have again shown that you don’t understand <strong>what my position even is</strong>. Which is why I need to state it clearly before trying to prove it.</p><p><strong>Narrativist games don’t have to be blorby if they aren’t using traditional techniques.</strong> The case that Fiasco isn’t a narrativist game has been made in this thread, OK, fine, slot in whatever non-traditional narrativist game you want.

One example. Let’s start with…</p><p><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/436935/#Comment_436935" rel="nofollow">The invented dragon in AsIf’s Lady Blackbird game.</a></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>that’s not the actual creative payoff of the game</p></div></blockquote><p>This whole “creative payoff” concept is not a part of RISS official, canonical theory. I return to the game day after day, week after week, because I get excited about different things. Sometimes it’s on the soap opera layer, sometimes it’s on the puzzle layer, sometimes it’s on the discovery layer, often it’s on the rules layer because I’m at heart a <a href="https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Player_type#Mel_.28Melvin.2FMelanie.29" rel="nofollow">Mel</a>.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>it’s most often used to facilitate a Step On Up agenda, which is why it needs to be adhered to <em>strictly</em> - as you can imagine, given a different creative agenda, there wouldn’t likely be any need for it to be so strict.</p></div></blockquote><p>The third tier of truth, in combination with the wallpaper saliency principle, help address the strictness problem.</p><p>Blorby tabletop roleplaying is a wonderful medium that I strongly recommend. Applicability of the three CAs is kind of not the core of why blorb is so magical.</p><p>Regardless of why you have blorb, adding in a big unblorby element, especially when that element goes against the expectations of players, can make you lose the benefits of blorb in the first place. There’s not a lot of benefit to blorb if players think it’s all made-up and smoke-and-mirrors anyway. <strong>To see the magic of blorb,</strong> make sure the whole group understands how the game is set up, how the gloracle operates, and how that helps us know What is True in the World.</p><p>Yesterday we had a player character death in our campaign. <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/360" rel="nofollow">So unwanted.</a> Yet so undisputed because everything about it was extremely &amp; long-standedly established and reinforced after week after week. The sanctity of rules. The stats of the monster. The appearance rate of the monster. The location. The stairs, the floor, the walls, the rails.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I can <i>imagine</i> a group purely enjoying the “gloracular Machine in operation” as their main creative goal, but I doubt very many people do. Sandra’s game uses D&amp;D adventure modules, for example, as a large component of play - it wouldn’t make much sense to do that in a game which is purely interested in Exploration of that sort, I think.</p></div></blockquote><p>“Seeing the gloracular machine in operation” doesn’t map very well to the Big Model concept of Right to Dream. (It does have some more notes in common with threefold simulationism.)</p><p>Getting an adventure module—a pre-keyed map &amp; random encounter tables—and starting it up and making it come alive is really interesting and in some ways just as easy (or more) to feel is “real”. Mirror story; I could double check in the module years later that the mirror “was really there”. I’m not saying everyone needs to use adventure modules but if I had had access to something like The Lost City or The Lost Mine of Phandelver growing up I would’ve had a better sense of how to prep even homebrew stuff.</p><p>I think some of this is some of you growing up with a game that is blorby and then going “Ho-<em>ho</em>! It gets really cool if we compromise with blorb a little bit here, here, and here!” and I’m like a ragged old mariner stumbling onto the solid shore of blorb, saying a word of warning while pointing at the raging ocean of complete zero-blorb behind me: “<em>down that road is pure senseless </em>nihil<em>! I barely made it out alive!</em>”</p> </div>

                            I'm not familiar with Monster of the Week, but if it has a principle called "disclaim decision making", just like AW does, you could have used some of the techniques listed under this principle to guide your process of decision making. For instance, you could have just asked your players, set up a clock for the threat of Erris' death, or whatever else is given as an option.<br/><br/>Have you talked to the player to get to know how he felt? I don't see the game situation as something so terrible. It's certainly possible for a bullet shot at a fight, to harm an unintended target. Perhaps the player expected some kind of harm roll?<br/><br/> </div>

<blockquote>The invented dragon in AsIf’s Lady Blackbird game.</blockquote>
Ok, that's an interesting example. What I read here is the players were unclear on what the principles of this style of gaming were. They didn't want blorbiness or consistency, they wanted the illusion not to be torn apart. I've found this in other games, and many players are ok even with illusionist techniques, as long as the illusion remains. Keeping an illusion is worth that much of an effort? Definitely not for me. I see a thing here with how expectations were set, instead of an essential property of roleplaying with traditional techniques being broken.                        </div>

<small>a.k.a. "consult the gloracle"</small><br/><br/>Again for me those techniques (on p 87 of AW 2e) all seem very subjective. Even the clock since there's no fixed principle for how many slices of time there should be on the clock as far as I can see, and <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/progress-clocks" rel="nofollow">Blades in the Dark</a> is similarly open-ended about it.<br/><br/>In effect, the decision making isn't disclaimed <i>enough</i>.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> But this is why I don't know if AW is or isn't blorby. It's teetering on the borderline; either a brilliant design or it falls down into the ravine of sorrow.                        </div>

Oh, in that case it's not a good example because we interpret it differently; I see them as wanting blorbiness and consistency. The "it just happened to be <i>exactly</i> the right amount of steam" thing was a miracle to them because they believed that that coincidentally stemmed out of the gloracle.

Well, one of the things I've been saying in this thread is how using traditional techniques can sometimes set these expectations; and how one solution for reducing blorb-expectation is to introduce extremely alien techniques.<br/><br/> </div>

<p>When the illusion breaks I’ve seen three common reactions.</p><ol><li>You can desire more adherence to blorbiness; and also develop a mistrust of other DMs and GMs unless they are really good at showing work. Maybe becoming a “forever DM” yourself since you can’t trust other DMs enough to become a player.</li><li>You can request the illusion to be kept better next time.</li><li>You can become OK with it all being make-believe &amp; pretend &amp; hat-pullery</li></ol><p><small>[Let’s leave the “you can start seeing the improvisation just as shamanistically as the true blorb; seeing it as a sort of internal, intuitive gloracle” can of worms unopened for now; I said three common reactions, I didn’t say <em>only</em> these three reactions. (My position, btw, is that that kind of <em>reliance</em> on tier three truth, rather than having it as a safety-net/fallback, is not gloracular.)]</small></p><p>If you haven’t experienced true blorb, outcome two and three become more likely (merely by virtue of outcome one becoming very <em>un</em>likely if you don’t know what happiness the blorb can bring). (Uh you’re right <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22097/etymology-of-blorb/p1" rel="nofollow">in the other thread</a>, I’m getting sick of the word too.)</p><p>My reaction when the illusion broke was the third one. And I went down a complete and very radical [that’s my nature; I like to go to the root of things] rabbit-hole of “no myth”. Until I experienced the life-changing magic of blorb with the “mirror story” and switched over to the first reaction.</p><p>I’ve seen outcome three again and again and again and again.

I think you're absolutely right. I guess I was wondering what it would be like to declare ahead of time what categories of outcomes I would "disclaim decision making" for. Like saying I always use the d6 method for determining named NPC death, rather than just disclaiming for one particular NPC in the moment. And maybe in the long term game we would use the situation to decide as a group what our preferred resolution method would be going forward.<br/><br/>For the record Monster of the Week has one bullet point in the principles called "you don't always have to decide what happens", but it's not expanded upon at all. Honestly the GM advice in that game is fine, it's just that Apocalypse World does a much better job imo.

We did talk about it a little, enough to think he wasn't totally satisfied with how things turned out. I wish I could remember better but it was a long game and I was pretty worn out after.                        </div>

                            Sometimes, "the DM decides" <i>can</i> work as a rule. In 5e, the DM can decide whether NPCs die at 0 hp or if they roll death saves. This has a similar problem as AW and MotW has re this. In practice what we do is that NPCs that belong to the party—their employees and employers, wives, husbands and kin—do roll death saves, while enemy combat monsters generally don't.                        </div>

                            Something that might be helpful, which I haven't seen done so far, is define exactly what constitutes "traditional techniques".

My position on this is somewhat nuanced and very specific. I don't think I've ever told Sandra that her "real love" is challenge (it's very clear that the blorb dollhouse/gloracle is foremost in your heart!), or that her group plays with a Step On Up agenda (if I have, let me know, and I'll gladly take it back as well as apologize). Like Eero, I don't see any hope or benefit in labeling strangers online with some vague theory terms (unless they ask for it, I suppose, but no one's really ever asked me to do so). It's foolish, disrespectful, and far too likely to be entirely wrong.<br/><br/>Eero and I have both found a really successful mode of play which combines "blorb" (Sandra's term) or "hygienic GMing" (Eero's term) with a strong Step On Up agenda for really effective and highly focused gaming. I find that, once you get those concepts lined up (and learn to stick to them), it's almost bulletproof. Those ideas have allowed me to enjoy D&amp;D without reservation for the first time.<br/><br/>Unlike Sandra (but perhaps like Eero), I find both to be absolutely necessary to make it work. I played with strict "blorb" for years and years and never had that kind of gaming until the missing piece - the focus on challenge, and a recognition that it was happening even when it might seem like it's not (more about that below) - was brought in, thanks to Eero.<br/><br/>It does require a slightly more sophisticated understanding of "challenge", though (at least, enough that I could see it tripping some people up). Given that understanding, "blorb" tells us HOW to prepare material and make rules and rulings, while "focus on challenge" tells us WHEN to use it (how to distinguish wallpaper from things that are important to prep). Put the two together, and you have a working method for play that really, really works. Have just one, and you're lucky if the thing goes at all.<br/><br/>The key that's kind of weird (or, at least, easy to miss) is that the GM, in this style of play, isn't engaged in the process the same way that the players are. The GM's role is to prep and make rulings and present vivid and concrete fiction; the whole point of blorb/hygienic practices is to remove the GM from the challenge/competition. (We want to remove the GM's ability to switch what the mirror does at the last minute precisely so that she cannot invalidate the cleverness of the players by switching up what's behind the curtain - and, similarly, so she cannot cheat around a poor decision by the players by changing things in their favour.)<br/><br/>As you can see, this has absolutely nothing to do with "game balance" (there are types of games that have similar techniques and a similar agenda which find game balance important, but this is a very different beast); it has do with <i>fairness</i>. <br/><br/>It can be really fun and really exciting for the players to go up against an overwhelmingly difficult challenge. It can be really fun and really exciting when the players manage to cleverly circumvent a challenge and get an easy victory: the point is not to provide balance, but to <i>make their decisions really matter</i>. That's one of the central functions of a sandbox setup: to let the players decide which challenges they want to confront.<br/><br/>When you play in this style, the GM sets up the "dollhouse" and the rules by which it functions, and then sits back to see what will happen. The players, meanwhile, rub their hands together, feeling confident that the GM isn't cheating, and get ready to be as clever and as lucky as possible: they are facing challenge, not the GM.<br/><br/>I think that it's easy to lose sight of this as a GM committed to "gloracular" methods, because you're not really engaged in the "challenge" aspect as a participant. However, if you imagine a day when you come to the table and the players aren't trying to survive and win - perhaps they put down their weapons and run into the dungeon with their eyes closed - and you'll see that they are very much engaging with challenge, because when they stop doing so, the whole purpose for play seems really unclear all of a sudden. <br/><br/>I don't know for sure what's happening in Sandra's game, of course (and we know there's quite a mish-mash of techniques, so there's likely, I think, a mish-mash of types of "fun" happening), but that's what I've seen pretty consistently in other games I've run and played.<br/><br/>Here are some examples of why this might be true for Sandra (she'll have to confirm or deny, but I'll show what I'm seeing):
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>&lt;&lt;p&gt;Really good example.</p><p>We had a very similar example in our game yesterday. A beloved hench NPC – or rather, the wife of one of the characters, rolled up on XGE life paths–(well, she’s not universally loved on the soap opera layer but they need her magic cello because it conjures a cabin for them to live and she also can conjure food and water for them with it, so they def don’t want her to die) had her head stuck in a trap. The way the players dealt damage to the trap also risked her. She ended up making it out with only six hit points remaining.</p><p>The fact that this was handled gloracularly added a lot to the tension and to the outcome. Yet another triumph of blorb♥</p></div></blockquote>
My impression (and you can tell me if I'm wrong) is that the players weren't approaching the wife with her head stuck in a trap with a scientist's perspective ("Hey, I guess she could live or she could die. Let's engage this mechanical process, and we'll find out which in the end, but we'll be happy either way..." - "Oh! She'd be more likely to survive if we hit the trap with a hammer, becaus she has resistance to bludgeoning weapons..." "Shut up, Bob! You're ruining the experiment! Let's stick with the spears...") but as people desperately trying to save her life (looking for new solutions, different ideas, different ways that they could get her out alive).<br/><br/>In the end, knowing that you all followed the procedures faithfully makes the success feel more earned and more real - that makes it more valuable and more potent. But the key to it is that there was a challenge and the players managed to win (this time)! They saved her! Without the consistent and fair process, the success wouldn't have been <i>earned</i>, and wouldn't have felt as satisfying.<br/><br/>Another potentially telling point is that "they need her magic cello because it conjures a cabin and food and water", "so they def don't want her to die": her presence is useful to them as a way to be less likely to "lose" the game of survival:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>A good player in a blorby game takes their role as visitor to another world seriously. In this holodeck, or danger room, or Narnia wardrobe, they have one job. It’s a difficult one: To live.</p></div></blockquote>
If "living" is "difficult", that sounds like a situation where survival is a <i> challenge</i>.                        </div>

"Apply their best brain to the puzzle of combat situations" is a pretty good and concise description of what "challenge-based adventuring" is all about. I know that it's not the only thing that happens in Sandra's games, but it seems to be, at least, one of the main features of play.<br/><br/>The "monster AI" for combat is another example: it enables the GM to remove herself from the flow of combat, giving the players a "system" of opposition to test their skills against. (If true simulation, a la Threefold, was, instead, the goal, then giving the monsters an "algorithm" but not the PCs would be a rather unbalanced simulation. The PCs have a strong advantage in this scenario; if the idea was to "simulate" or "test" the *characters'* battle effectiveness against certain monsters, it would make sense to write a similar algorithm/AI for the PCs, as well. The fact that this isn't even remotely on the table, is, again, a way to give an opportunity to the players to Step On Up and test their wits and skills against an objective reality/system.)<br/><br/>In "what did you play this week", Sandra talks about a particularly exciting, successful heist the players pulled off:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483939/#Comment_483939" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483939/#Comment_483939</a><br/><br/>This seems to me as another example of how cleverness and luck win out over adversity; what makes it cool is that the players were <i>smart</i>. They faced a challenge and they <i>won</i>. <br/><br/>Read that snippet (it describes a really awesome successful heist moment!), and tell me that it's celebrating anything other than a brilliant play by the players when faced with a challenge. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Which, on a related topic, if the game isn't about challenge at least at some level, why use D&amp;D adventure modules? Why play Finchian trap-disarming games? (Heck, why have deadly traps in the first place?) Why remove all the skills from the game that replace player cleverness? Etc.<br/><br/>I hope that makes my position clear. I could be utterly wrong about Sandra and her game, for all I know, but it's definitely a trend I've seen in different groups and different situations, and it explains a lot of those questions very cleanly and efficiently.                        </div>

We focus on things were we need clarity/answers. To survive a challenging situation, sure, or to deal with emotional or dramatic fallout, or to marvel at a discovery.</p><p>Instead of spending an extradiegetic day stuck on an ice moon or in void space without even finding as much as a single ice moon, the diegetic time goes quickly “until it matters”.

The GM’s role is to prep and make rulings and present vivid and concrete fiction; the whole point of blorb/hygienic practices is to remove the GM from the challenge/competition. (We want to remove the GM’s ability to switch what the mirror does at the last minute precisely so that she cannot invalidate the cleverness of the players by switching up what’s behind the curtain - and, similarly, so she cannot cheat around a poor decision by the players by changing things in their favour.)</p></div></blockquote><p>So even the “mirror story” is gamist now. See, this is what I’m talking about, people telling me what my agenda is. Arguably it <em>is</em> gamist. But I had played gamist/challenge games before (board games, card games, video games).

So when I don't know what rule to apply, for example for climbing a tree (before I had our current overy-complicated &amp; detailed rules in place), and I see multiple outcomes, I'll do a twelve-twenty. I see what's the worst outcome, and what's the best outcome, and what are all the rest (I don't need to sort these). For example climbing a tree while wolves on the ground are biting you: worst outcome: fall &amp; hurt yourself, best outcome: successfully climb up tree, mediocre outcome: not get up in time just stand there under the tree for a round. One roll with two DCs: DC 12 to get to mediocre outcome (player's choice of mediocre outcomes if there are several), DC 20 to get to best outcome. 11 or lower and you get worst outcome.<br/><br/>The gloracle is sometimes a very precise golden machine and sometimes you can see the chewing gum &amp; hanger wire.<br/><br/>Normally these situations if they're common enough a rule will get wrote up by me!                        </div>

                            Being constrained by established facts. That's a form of coherence I really enjoy. It's my favourite form of aesthetic realism in RPGs. <br/>This thread and others mess with the meaning I associated with "traditional ". For me, a traditional game or technique is one that is passed along without scrutiny of what it does, but based on "it's always been done this way". If concrete examples reveal that fairness fosters a climate of social security in which creativity (be it used for challenge or invention) thrives... I'd say yes, but what's the big deal ?                        </div>

                            I don't see a need for it. Look : the DM just fetches the "act 3, everything is messed up" tables and the party keeps on dungeonning. Only their encounters will have an overall distinctive flavour. Reincorporated NPCs, usual agents now in tangled situations. This doesn't feel very hippie to me. Pendragon has animal parables of that sort, for instance. The DM just picked a specific set of tables.<br/>Ah but, of course, the DM is framing the characters in spite of realism.

                            Tables can be switched if there is a diegetic reason for that to happen. I have something similar in my game; there is an event that if it happens, the world gets messed up and the random encounter tables are turned. But we have to <b>play to find out</b> if that happens; it's not a "planned arc" or a series of planned events.<br/><br/>The pre-planned-5-acts-structure is the unblorby part and why using trad techniques set up bad expectations. The tables-are-new thing is fine.                        </div>

                            The reason for using hippie techniques isn't because of technical necessity. Traditional techniques can handle anything. The reason the hippie techniques are mandatory is because of expectation management.                        </div>

                            ... so players don't get off track because of superficial similarities. OK. <br/>I see that like chemicals for aromatic extraction. Some are very industrial, others more skin-friendly. Others have a capture-release range that just fits in between the previous two sorts. Tools to a task. <br/>What I like in John Harper games is they capture traditional gamers and sit them at a table with hippie gamers !

<small>a.k.a. "consult the gloracle"</small><br/><br/>Again for me those techniques (on p 87 of AW 2e) all seem very subjective. Even the clock since there's no fixed principle for how many slices of time there should be on the clock as far as I can see, and <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/progress-clocks" rel="nofollow">Blades in the Dark</a> is similarly open-ended about it.<br/><br/>In effect, the decision making isn't disclaimed <i>enough</i>.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> But this is why I don't know if AW is or isn't blorby. It's teetering on the borderline; either a brilliant design or it falls down into the ravine of sorrow.</div></blockquote>
What's your reasoning for calling this mechanic in AW kind of subjective? You know, there seem to be plenty of subjective gaps in starts without number and other dust too, many of them even recognised by the author. For once, the adventure generator works with abstract concept, like "person, place, complication", which the GM then puts in context. <br/><br/>Even this blorb machine, at best, is a machine with a human operating it, pressing the levers, feeding it input and interpreting the output. Like every other game. Even this fairness is kind of an illusion. A productive one, perhaps, but it's kind of delusional to think the whole machine is less subjective than "disclaim decision making" in AW.<br/><br/>Next question: has this method been used successfully for genres other than dungeon crawling? Dungeons are kind of easy because they're a constrained space with relatively few agents, but how do you leave everything to prep and tables in a city? Even SwN admits many, many times players will have you improvise. I can imagine tons of situations that will require more "subjectiveness" than AW's  "disclaim decision making", unless the GM actually creates every building and NPC and faction in every single location, which is kind of straining even for low populations of 10k.<br/><br/>At last: in one of your recent posts, you make a point that the challenge, or game, is about survival. That's so damn specific as a goal to play! I don't think a technique that narrows the play focus so much can be thought of as a must for every game with a GM, unless most of the campaigns, games and genres start looking like a reskin of of&amp;d modules!<br/><br/>What worries me here is that there's this segment of the hobby suddenly talking about fairness, about an impartial GM and about removing subjectivity from the act of GMing, like those things exist, all while they're blind to the MANY moments of subjectivity their gaming involves!<br/><br/>One last point: it could be argued that, as well as there is tension between traditional techniques and story now mechanics, there's tension also between this pretension for objectivity and fairness, and the need of a human interpreter/operator for this blorby machine. The disruptive tension seems lower, in my opinion, for traditional story games, which kind of acknowledge the human component in the activity (it's not a computer simulation, after all, but a social game), and design with this in mind. The blorby spectrum seems to try to overcompensate by loading with work a single person. As I said before, this amount of work just to keep the illusion living is not what I aim for in an RPG.                        </div>

                            I love the rigorous approach to prep and transparency that this style of gaming calls for, and how you (Sandra) are giving a sort of master class on its techniques. That part is awesome!<br/><br/>However, elevating “blorb” to heavenly status and attributing the success of your game (and, apparently, all traditional games!) is, in my opinion, a mistake of the highest order.<br/><br/>It’s like we reliving the need for the Forge all over again - back when people argued endlessly about how their specific Technique was BEST!!!1!1! instead of acknowledging the reality that we’re all sitting around a table making stuff up, and that ultimately any sense of objectivity is an illusion anyhow. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a> says it well, above.                        </div>

My take is that it is because you had *all the other pieces already in place*. Adding blorb “completed the puzzle” for you.<br/><br/>For someone else, they might be missing another, different piece of the puzzle. Simply adding blorb to their game isn’t suddenly going to make it awesome. They need another key, missing piece.<br/><br/>(And that’s saying nothing of people who have entirely different priorities for play, where blorb wouldn’t even be helpful - someone who’s playing Fiasco and having trouble negotiating collaborative narration isn’t suddenly going to have an awesome time by adding random tables for weather.)<br/><br/> </div>

Yes. I've often lamented that I got into roleplaying at a pessimal time. When no-one could teach me blorb. Drakar had many editions but the edition that removed all semblances of normal blorb…? That was the edition I happened to get <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/><br/>I believe that that's why the fad ended. The NES was invented (which was great, love that Castlevania action) and the illuuussiory actions were invented (which were not so good). Even our beloved <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20672/d-d-expert-set-dice-shenanigans/p1" rel="nofollow">B/X got in on the action</a>.

This is gold. Agreed. We need to identify all the principles including blorb but also the other puzzle pieces.

I've seen that. I saw a group where the party was trapped in a cage and the DM just let them sit there in real time for hours and hours. I've seen another group where the party was travelling in a forest, and a third one where they were travelling on a boat, and just <i>nothing happening</i>.                        </div>

                            Hehe! Yes, some people are really bad at that. Even experienced, intelligent groups occasionally screw up (c.f. the ice moon story).<br/><br/>But I’ve never seen any group play out every time they have a meal, go to the bathroom, not summarize and skip night watches, etc.<br/><br/>I think people intuitively understand that fictional time does not correspond to real time (except in LARPS). Presumably they thought the cage and the boat were important for some reason? (Usually, it’s the GM waiting for the players to do something particular - like figuring out the one way they prepped to escape from the cage - or going for emotional affect: “I want them to FEEL the tense monotony of being trapped!”)<br/><br/>But, hey, maybe there is someone out there who doesn’t “get” zooming in or out at all, and I just haven’t met such people yet. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> , I agree with most of what you’re saying. Blorb is not an agenda in itself and so on. I also think looking at AW moves is really interesting, I’m maybe going to start a thread about that.<br/><br/>When I’m trying to look at the fun I break it down as follows:<br/><br/>SITUATION – There is something exciting about the fictional situation. What is it? The excitement tends to be modified by the ‘system’<br/>SYSTEM – Is the means we turn the current situation into a new...<br/>SITUATION – The situation got changed, what’s exciting about the new situation in regards to the old situation?<br/><br/>The excitement is modified by system because on the level of pure fiction I can get a pay off, but that’s not why I’m roleplaying, I’m roleplaying because I contribute to the situation changing. Example: If the system we use is that the player has to use their wits to disarm the trap by describing things they do and the GM adjudicating, then that’s going to shape the players excitement about the situation.<br/><br/>So the way I see salience is, it’s a situation we’re all excited about.                         </div>

                            Absolutely! <br/><br/>So, now, how do you know before it happens whether the situation will be something you’re all excited about or not?<br/><br/>Is it pure trial and error, or do you have a good sense of that before you sit down and play?<br/><br/>That understanding is required for any kind of good gaming, and, in particular, it is just as necessary in order to know what to blorb and what not to blorb. <br/><br/>Basically, a sense of what the game is about: once that’s in place, we can make intelligent decisions about whether something needs to be handled a certain way or not. (This is why in Sandra’s game the monsters get an algorithm but the heroes don’t - because the players are here to test their skills and wits and try to win the fight, but the GM is not.)                        </div>

The idea of the heroes getting an algorithm is the stupidest idea I've ever heard.<br/>So I guess you are trying to say that <i>neither</i> side should have an algorithm.<br/><br/>Remember that one reason why the algorithm is so important is that it simulates the limitations of spatiality without having a cartesian representation.<br/><br/>Without the algorithm we could have 32 raptors biting one character. With it we can't.                        </div>

                            "Predicate space" being built in the algorithm is not the whole of the algorithm. The <i>raison d'être</i> of the algorithm is for you to get an answer without interfering with the monsters having their lunch, which is typically a blorby technique.<br/>Paul_T's point that PCs actions are at the center of play is not a very strong point but it is not invalidated by a <i>reductio ab absurdum</i> (what if there was no algorithm).  I'd say PCs actions are important because they reflect players decisions, which are important in any healthy game. <br/>So, that was just a bump. Paul_T's question before that was about the "situation". By that I think he meant "moment to moment". That is : when do you feel in your games that "yummy" feeling that "this (diegetic) thing is (going to be) cool" ? I hesitate between actual and near future because I don't want to frame the answer too much in a "play to find out" perspective.<br/><br/>edit : (diegetic) or not                        </div>

                            (Right. Diegetic or non-diegetic, it doesn’t matter: somehow we need criteria to determine what’s going to be fun and what is not. We need to determine what is salient and what is not. We need to determine what needs to be prepped and what does not. We need to know what is worth “zooming in” and what we can fast forward through.)                        </div>

Still, good question.<br/>Maybe a progamer reward of an uninterrupted execution.                        </div>

                            So we do the characters meals because they would die and starve otherwise.<br/>In an urban campaign where we can just be like "OK you're making enough to support a Moderate Lifestyle" or whatever, we wouldn't.<br/><br/>That particular saliency point is a challenge one, sure. But not all saliency points are. Salient points are about answers that we <i>need</i> to have in order for play to proceed and things that other mechanics build upon.                        </div>

                            Hi Sandra,<br/><br/>Feel free to call me a primitive screw head mostly because I'm very late to this thread but WRT - 
<blockquote>Blorby play is almost magical in how it can take you to another world and make that world real. That is valuable.</blockquote>
- I can only argue by experience.  The game I play in does the exact same thing to our human players except many times the game is 100% non-blorb.  We will sit down, the GM will ask us to read off our characters and in less than 30 minutes were off and running and totally transported to another world.  I am utterly delighted at the success of your GMing and design efforts but I can't think of a game that is more diametrically opposed to blorby play than ours is from yours.  This isn't good or bad.  Just a <i>completely</i> different approach to the process of play.  Just one example - You push for absolute clarity of play (am I using the correct phrase?) while we embrace the fog of war.<br/><br/>Just my 2 cents.  Maybe 1 and half cents...<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

<p>To clarify, Silmenume, blorb isn’t about clarity [even though you’re right that I <em>loooove</em> clarity], blorb is about the game world being consistent and “real” and the DM not changing things around behind the scenes, instead sticking to the truth of “what’s really there”. The notes say that this room has a straw bed, a bowl of clear water and the two halves of a broken wand, that, under detect-o-vision, gives off the faint flicker of the school of divination, what do you do? That is blorb.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>What’s the best thing about absolute clarity?</p>I know you’ve made many arguments for the value of absolute clarity</div></blockquote><p>That’s right. And for information separation as well; players don’t know everything right away but they understand when, why and how a rule is engaged. They don’t know that a monster is immune to lightning until after they’ve fired a bolt at her, but they understand how immunity works. Ideally your game have or would have similar knowledge; like how you know that daggers &amp; arrows do PBP damage in your game. It wouldn’t be great if you didn’t know that, right? All of a sudden an arrow kills you and you were like “wait what? I had like 50 stamina left.”</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>and I’ve made many arguments in my threads about how lack of fore knowledge requires players to engage the same logic processes we employ in real life when faced with imperfect knowlege as we do in the game to create the cognitive map of reality.</p>By capitalizing on the same logic process under similar conditions it becomes very easy to shift from one reality to another.</div></blockquote><p>Yes, that’s the ideal. Decisions made on the diegetic layer.</p><p>Player: “I search for traps!”<br/>Me: “Hold on… what, specifically, are you doing?”<br/>Player: “Oh, OK… how does the door frame look here?”<br/>Me: “It does look unusual… it’s lined with a bright orange metal; copper possibly.”</p><p>etc</p><p>In your game, some of the time the processes you engage are rolling d20s. Regardless of if you’re fighting or just looking (<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483514/#Comment_483514" rel="nofollow">Perception and Intuition</a>).</p><p>You’ve been very generous sharing many examples of play.</p><p>In your game a lot of the time the DM is saying “You do this, this and this. Roll a twenty-sided!” and you reply “1d20 + 7 = 8” and he says “OK the enemy does this, this and this! Roll a twenty-sided!” and you reply “1d20 = 16” and he says “Oh wow, it almost this this but you this and this and this! And then you this and this and this! Roll a twenty-sided!” and you reply “1d20 + 7 = 21” and he says “no you almost this but then this and this, and suddenly a big this!!!! wow! roll a twenty-sided!” and you go NATURAL TWENTY! and everyone cheers.</p><p>And I’m like… wait when are <em>you</em> doing things except just listing numbers? Sometimes. Creating characters. Talking about the scenario before the game. But some of the time it’s the DM saying what <em>you</em> do. “You go in.” “You crash through the door.” “You pull out your knife.” That is not same logic processes I engage in real life.</p><p>You’re right that me, in response to the player saying what they do, saying “Make an attack roll vs 17” or “Make a defense roll vs 16” rather than saying “Roll a 20-sided” is a difference between the games. That isn’t really a blorb issue; that’s more a clarity issue. Arguably in real life you know or at least notice whether you are parrying vs slashing, dodging vs rushing, blocking vs smashing. I’m never a fighter; I don’t know jack about real fighting but even I know <em>that</em> much.</p> </div>

<p>I want to know <em>what the characters say or do</em>. That’s why I have them around the table. I am curious about their choices, actions, priorities. (That’s also why the argument upthread that I should replace them with an algorithm was stupid and/or that I should ditch the monster algorithm. I am a curious DM; I want to see the game world come alive and the characters be fully realized in that game world. I don’t hold any ideas of my own about what could, should or would happen.</p><p>Similar to how Ron describes it in his video.</p><p>Which makes me realize how weird it is that the entire GNS, where they took such steps to distance themselves from the relatively close schools of gamism &amp; simulationism, with a couple of rare exceptions ignored the elephant in the room: railroading. Dismissing it as dysfunctional play, force, etc and then backpedaling with more neutral words like participationism &amp; rollercoastering. Like guys, you know what G, N and S have in common? <strong>Play to find out.</strong> Which, at the time and even now, is something so radical and something so non-selfevident and something so controversial in the world of tabletop RPG.</p><p>And before the threefold and the GNS the debates raged on and on about 1d20 vs 3d6, about dice pools and bell curves and linear dice and swinginess etc. Because that was all we understood.</p><p>Instead, the three schools/camps identified should’ve been this:</p><p><b>A.</b> Having both elements and events pre-written<br/><b>B.</b> Setting out some <em>solid</em> elements in the petri dish and seeing what happens in the game<br/><b>C.</b> Having nothing, not even the elements, prepared, everything is pulled out of hat as you go</p><p>Arguably between the Scylla of railroading on the left and the Charybdis of nihilism on the right, there is… playing to find out!</p><p><em>That’s</em> a technique that serves both Gamism, Narrativism and Simulationism. That’s where the battle lines should’ve been drawn.</p><p>My limited understanding back in the actual 90s were that the choices were between A and C.

                            "wait when are you doing things except just listing numbers" What if it didn't matter if player or DM spoke as long as "the character does it" ? In the same way you say " I don’t hold any ideas of my own about what could, should or would happen", the player in Cary's game loses themself in their character. Being a player in this game, or a DM in a blorby game may share in common the experience of acting like an ego-less medium for characters / events.<br/>Of course, experiencing ego-lessness is probably not the end goal, it's the magic circle.

                            I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> that your games are almost entirely opposites of each other. The focus in your game (Sandra) is, it seems to me, to create something as "tangible" as possible that the players can then interact with. There are solid and predictable qualities and quantities and solid and reliable ways to interact with them. We know that there's something inside the treasure chest, and that, if we open it, Sandra won't change what it is on us. We know that the monsters will attack according to an algorithm. We know how much we can carry. And so on.<br/><br/>Jay/Cary's game is all about the experience of the world/story/characters, and uses obfuscation on every level to achieve that.<br/><br/>You want things to *be* as real and tangible as possible, and for player decisions to matter as much as possible. This demands transparency of method.<br/><br/>Cary wants things to *feel* as powerful as possible, and for the players' emotional experience to be immersive and memorable. This demands "fog of war", so that you can feel the tension and fear and uncertainty and experience it vicariously.<br/><br/>Complete opposites, in my opinion. I would engage in each of your games in a completely different way, and being a good player in them demands very different skills, approach, and mindset.                        </div>

                            (Also, I'm not sure why the "fighting algorithm" went so far over your head. I was never suggesting that you should remove the algorithm - which is wonderful! - or write one for the players - which would be pointless. I was saying that this thought experiment - imagining either of those things, and seeing how undesirable either of them is - reveals a lot about your play priorities.)<br/><br/>(For instance, if you started to think that "Threefold Simulationism" was your actual goal, you'd have to conclude that writing an algorithm for the PCs would be at least worth considering - it would play nicely into the "simulation", and give a better "answer", rather than giving one side a dramatic advantage over the other. And if your goal was an adversarial competition between the two sides, you'd want to take away the monsters' algorithm, because it handicaps one side. On the other hand, if your goal was to create a railroady story, you might want an algorithm for the PC side, and then to be able to improvise the monsters' actions, so as to steer the fight's outcome to your desired ends.)<br/><br/>(But your solution, instead, suits your game perfectly: and that's because it enables precisely what you want - for the GM to act as impartial referee, while a clear and definite, "real", tangible process gives the players something to test their wits and skills against.)                        </div>

                            Hi Sandra,
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>To clarify, Silmenume, blorb isn’t about clarity [even though you’re right that I <em>loooove</em> clarity], blorb is about the game world being consistent and “real” and the DM not changing things around behind the scenes, instead sticking to the truth of “what’s really there”. </p></div></blockquote>
First my apologies for mis-identifying what "blorb" meant.  Adding confusion serves no one's interests in forum discussions.  Mea culpa.<br/><br/>Here's the rub with "what's really <i>there</i>."  There is no ontological "there" there.  It's <i>all</i> an artificial construct manufactured by human beings.  As far as role-playing games are concerned (the act of Exploration as defined by Setting, Character, Situation, Color and System) the only "reality" that matters is the SIS.  Which is also an artificial construct.  The primacy of the SIS is so vital because it covers the idea of <i>all</i> the players interacting with it with agency as mediated by System.  This is the uniqueness of RPGs as compared to other recreational pastimes.  It is a group imagination process...a highly ritualized form of conversation if you will.<br/><br/>We use physical props to influence this conversation but they are no more "truth" than the SIS.  This includes having pre-written notes on "what's really there".  Until these things enter the SIS directly in themselves (physical things) or affect the physical things (a pile of enriched Uranium that is causing radiation sickness in people but is itself not [yet] established) then they are merely potentialities under the control of the GM.<br/><br/>I'm not arguing against game prep as a useful process.  I'm just arguing that it is merely a technique to help with the player who is functioning in the role of "GM".  If this technique helps the person of "GM" facilitate their players to "immerse" into the artificially constructed world then bully for the GM!  Good for that person for finding a method of GMing that works for them.  However that <i>technique of prep</i> does not represent "truth" any more than a game where the GM does no pre-game prep.  As far as the SIS is concerned there is no difference.  The only thing that matters are the words spoken by the GM.  It is only then that when those words are accepted as credible via the Lumpley Principle do they <i>matter</i>.<br/><br/>Now we get into issues of player protagonization WRT to CA's.  There is a form of deprotagonizaton that crosses all CA's (when a player is shut out from entering anything into the SIS) but there is also CA specific player deprotagonization.  Paul Czege argued this WRT how this worked in Narratist play which is <i>very different</i> with how player deprotagonization functions in Gamist play.  I was going to post a link to the thread but the Forge Archives seem to be down.<br/><br/>I'm seeing two basic thrusts to your arguments.<br/><br/>First is a matter of trust among the players and the GM.  Blorb preparation deals with this by not dealing with said trust but by player verification of GM pre-game notes.  There are other ways of handling this including but not limited to game design, System and being consistently straight with one's players.  I gave you the example of the Elf running on water for the latter.<br/><br/>Second the magic of the Gloricle (which I believe is a description of "blorby" play) leads to player "immersion."  Great!  That is a <i>Technique</i> you employ to help facilitate getting your players to a state of being - that of "immersion".  That's a hard thing to do in general and that you manage to achieve it regularly is to be commended.  But <i>it isn't the only way</i> to facilitate the same effect in the one's players.  I know this to be true because of the game I play in.  I currently don't fully understand how it all works, but I've been afforded some theoretical assistance via Myth and Bricolage.  I'm not implying this other method is better, I'm just stating that it does exist and it too works very well at facilitating player "immersion".<br/><br/>I'll address your other points in a follow up post.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Otherwise you’re just chopping down trees in an empty forest.</p><p>A railroad game would script out the entire battle (as sometimes happened in Theatrix days) to be dramatic rather than algorithmical.</p><p>Althoooo…. nightmare vision of Theatrix flowchart…. or <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/dod91-stridsdiagram.jpg" rel="nofollow">the flowchart for PC actions in Drakar 91 so much</a>….</p><p>OK, no <em>good</em> game would ever do that.</p><p>The fact that this one railroad game scripted PC actions and this one sim game scripted PC actions was awful. It was bad game design.</p><p>Drakar itself actually <strong>tells you to not use it</strong> (another example of how horribly incoherent that awful game was); tellingn you to illusionarily rattle some dice behind the screen instead (“and maybe have like a 10% or so chance that an arrow actually hit”).</p><p><em>If your game has a concept of a PC in the first place</em> (so “pooled PC games” like Microscope or Final Girl are exempt); a <em>player</em> character… you let the players run that character and then the DM run the world.

For a RR game I would script the fights differently but for a exploration or sim game I’d script it the exact same. In fact, for a pure challenge game, instead I’d do something like Rune or 4e or Three Sixteen where the DM can apply her wits to try to win the fight instead of just executing a script.</p><p>Anyway. Not the point. The point is that even considering scripting the PCs actions would’ve been… WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY EVEN BE AT THE TABLE REGARDLESS OF CA?!!?? To just be there to rattle of numbers for me when I say “roll a twenty-sided?”</p>

                            Err even if I find the point weak, it wouldn't be that caricatural. Maybe like all conflicts are 1-1 and the other are helpers (plenty of games) or it's 2 front ranks and two back ranks max. That would be pretty scripted and still viable. But the players would have to find their challenge in, say, managing coins and vials, rather than maneuvering a combat space.                        </div>

I don't see how "blorby prep" is as necessary in Narrativist play (and have yet to see an example to demonstrate why it would be harmful) as it is in this kind of game; you can have a totally effective Narrativist game with traditional techniques (whether it's a la Sorcerer or a la "spicy dice", as in Jay's game) without strict "blorb" whatsoever.                        </div>

This thread has become really interesting to me.  The "tangible" play here is exactly what I have focused my Torchbearer GM-ing on, and I think it's something the game does really well by making time, light, inventory, etc into completely player-facing currencies.  I also play with transparent obstacles (the difficulty rating of each roll).  Players can look to the back of the book and tell me the difficulty of brewing a certain elixir, or a vertical ascent with two climbers (I get to add +1 ob for extenuating circumstances, or grant them an extra die for an advantage, but that's the extent of my GM influence).<br/><br/>I think the few of my friends that didn't take to the system either said that it was too complicated or it wasn't immersive.  I don't actually think Torchbearer is more complicated than other dungeon crawling games, but far more of the rules are player-facing.  This thread has helped me see why some folks had a problem with immersion.  Every time I explained a new system, I was supporting my agenda of a transparent, tangible game but undermining their desire for a bit of "fog of war".<br/> </div>

                            The immersionnist player who wants to blur the machinery I understand perfectly. As in a Larp where you want less things that derail your suspension of disbelief.<br/>What I found absurd and came to understand only lately is those players who invoke immersionnism to cling (my perspective obviously) to same old systems where the scenery is crowded with dice, game knobs and levers. The machinery protruding every step into the dreamscape. Sedimentation, calcification, fetishization sometimes. Trying not to judge, I just want to say : try different things, you'll be surprised how you'll like what you <i>fear</i> now.                        </div>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I think we might be reaching consensus here! That's nice to see.<br/><br/>Here's what I'm getting out of this thread - you tell me whether I'm missing your point or not, ok?<br/><br/>* Playing with traditional mechanics can set up an expectation of "blorby" play.<br/>* If that's not what you're doing, you can "telegraph" your game's actual means and goals far better if you use dramatically different techniques.<br/>* Otherwise, if you're playing "un-blorby", and the players are expecting "blorby", you'll disappoint people (or have other issues, or whatever). <br/>* If you're trying to run a Narrativist game using traditional techniques, it's really likely that you're running things in a "non-blorby" way, but the players are expecting "blorby" GMing, and therefore you'll be at odds.<br/><br/>If that's your point, I agree 100%. I was expecting something... stronger... from the opening line ("Narrativism with traditional techniques is bullshit!"), though. Like some kind of fundamental incompatibility or some theoretical problem.<br/><br/>I also agree that traditional techniques are not ideal for Narrativist play; but overlooking the dozens of published games and the decades of experience people have had playing in that style would be very strange - Narrativist play with traditional techniques is all there was for people for most of the lifespan of roleplaying games. And I recently played Sorcerer, which is traditional in many, many respects, and it was definitely Narrativist and we had a great time.

I think this is important to a lot of people! No doubt. And it's one reason to use "blorb prep" or traditional techniques, or both, for some people, in their Narrativist endeavours. But that's a very personal thing; for some people "blorbiness" helps with "feeling like you're there", for others it's that but also trust in the GM, for others still it's just about emotional connection to the story, and for some it's familiar mechanics that they don't need to spend any brain power parsing.<br/><br/>I also like some aspects of "blorb" for this reason; but I don't *need* it at all to "feel like I'm there", as I've discovered after playing a variety of games. (Though the trust in the game, the process, and the people is really key; and that's where it might come into play for you and me. Not everyone needs that, though, particularly if they've never had bad GM experiences, for instance.)

Ha! You really don't see how "character life &amp; death" and "character quest success" are issues of challenge? All those are challenges for the players to confront and try to win.<br/><br/>Have you ever played in a game where someone wanted to play a martyr, and wanted a glorious death? Or to see their character fall into a deep depression and commit suicide? Or tell the story of a man pursuing a "quest" for all the wrong reasons, failing, and learning something about himself in the process?<br/><br/>There are lots of games and playstyles where those issues aren't on the table at all.

I linked to <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/436935/#Comment_436935" rel="nofollow">this example</a> earlier.</p></div></blockquote>
I'm sorry if you felt that I ignored that example. I thought about writing about it, but I thought I'd come off as even more annoying to you.<br/><br/>You see, I think that example actually strengthens my argument here, rather than being a counterpoint.<br/><br/>What I'm looking for is an example of Narrativist play with traditional mechanics, right? And how not using "hygienic" practices (I'm getting really tired of using "blorb" in sentences, I think I much prefer "hygienic" and "gloracle" or "principled prep") ruined the Narrativism.<br/><br/>In this case, we have a game which is not very traditional (anyone who's read Lady Blackbird can attest to that, I think) and isn't supposed to be run in a traditional way (it specifically tells you not to plan ahead, and asking the players questions to establish the fictional situation should clue players in to its improvisational nature right away).<br/><br/>Furthermore, there's absolutely no reason I can see to assume (from that writeup) that there was any Narrativism happening.<br/><br/>What I see is players engaging in what they thought was challenge-based play, and being disappointed when it turned out that it wasn't. This could be read as a failure of non-blorbiness in challenge-based play, perhaps, but not as a failure to produce Narrativism.<br/><br/>(I say "perhaps" because the players in this case were rather deluded, I think; coming up with the "steam dragon" solution is actually far more clever and interesting if it was their original idea than if it had been a "GM's plan". Their <i>real</i> disappointment was not that they didn't get to face a proper challenge and win... it was in their own misguided belief that the GM was controlling the whole experience and had planned it all out. In other words, it's not that their premise-addressing or challenge-overcoming was invalidated - again, coming up with that solution is just as clever and just as successful whether the GM improvised the dragon or not, so long as the GM didn't come up with the steam breath thing *in response* to their being out of coal - but that they were disappointed to discover Tod <i>hadn't</i> rigged it all from the start.)<br/><br/>(Perhaps a better way to say it: they thought that "figure out Tod's secret plan" was the challenge here, and they were disappointed to discover that it was "figure out something that works on your own", instead. Personally, I would have been excited by that, rather than disappointed - it would mean that it was genuinely my original idea and a clever solution to the diegetic problem.)<br/><br/>(None of that has anything to do with traditional vs. non-traditional mechanics or Narrativism at all - not that I can see, anyway.)

                            Hi Sandra,
<blockquote>... Ideally your game have or would have similar knowledge; like how you know that daggers &amp; arrows do PBP damage in your game. It wouldn’t be great if you didn’t know that, right? All of a sudden an arrow kills you and you were like “wait what? I had like 50 stamina left.”</blockquote>
See, this is interesting.  The reason for the very existence of this particular mechanic is very different from task resolution mechanics typically employed in Gamist facilitating games.  The DM didn't create this mechanic (dagger &amp; arrows bypassing stamina and doing straight PBP) so as to present the players with a ex-diegetic tactical option.  He created this mechanic so that the players of high level characters never stop fearing (read - experiencing) for their lives in combat - even against your bog standard issue, Mark I, first level Orc.  IOW that mechanic wasn't designed to clarify to the player what can and cannot be done but rather to instill a sense of <i>player fear</i>.<br/><br/>Also note in your example of the surprised player at the implied sudden <i>change</i> of the fabric of reality of the fictional world.  The presumption presented was that arrows doing direct PBP was never heretofore encountered.  That was never the case.  If the GM were to suddenly make a sudden hard break from the bricoled reality of the world there would be a riot at the table - that would be a form of CA specific player deprotagonization.  Part of the Process of play in this CA is the player figuring out how the world works and that can only happen if the <i>presented</i> reality (read - the actions demonstrated within the SIS) is consistent.  IOW - we don't need to have ex-diegetic mechanics to tell us that arrows are deadly when 40 years of gaming always had arrows act with the same lethal effect.
<blockquote>In your game a lot of the time the DM is saying “You do this, this and this. Roll a twenty-sided!” and you reply “1d20 + 7 = 8” and he says “OK the enemy does this, this and this! Roll a twenty-sided!” and you reply “1d20 = 16” and he says “Oh wow, it almost this this but you this and this and this! And then you this and this and this! Roll a twenty-sided!” and you reply “1d20 + 7 = 21” and he says “no you almost this but then this and this, and suddenly a big this!!!! wow! roll a twenty-sided!” and you go NATURAL TWENTY! and everyone cheers.<br/><br/>And I’m like… wait when are you doing things except just listing numbers? Sometimes. Creating characters. Talking about the scenario before the game. </blockquote>
Unfortunately you got tripped up by the nature of the communicating in a textural medium.  What isn't being accounted for, because it would be such a verbose process, is all the somatic stuff we're doing at the table.  Much but not all, granted, of the GM saying "you do this" or "you do that" is his verbalizing our mimed actions.  What you're hearing (or what I've posted) is only a part of the total communication process and for the most part is the lesser part during combat.  Numbers are part of that communicative process.  They point at the <i>relative</i> boon or bust of fate at that moment but the specifics come from the SIS which equals GM description.  How (not what) he describes these events is a matter of style and mood and in the case of combat at our table the mode of description is designed to be as exciting and dramatic as possible.  Those die rolls are part of that excitement because we don't know exactly what will come of them.  We have to be deeply focused on the value of the numbers because of just how granular the combat is on a somatic level.  IOW we have to be prepared to react instantly to a result that isn't what we hoped.
<blockquote>But some of the time it’s the DM saying what you do. “You go in.” “You crash through the door.” “You pull out your knife.” That is not same logic processes I engage in real life.</blockquote>
Most of this is covered in the above portion of the post, but I'm not seeing how these example statements invalidate the process of us players working out what is going on in the world - including such intangibles as the significance of any event, if any.  Granted much of this is background but it does serve the purpose of maintaining the baseline of the world.  Its when events stray from the necessary baseline that we engage the logic process.  That logic process demands a baseline in order to work.  To point to instances of baseline stuff as evidence of how the logic process doesn't work or apply misses the whole point of the baseline.<br/><br/>There is more of your post to cover and I will get there as soon as I can.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Well, if that’s your position, we have nothing to disagree on. I think the “lighter” position is fairly uncontroversial.<br/><br/>However, I also think that, for many people, applying non-blorb techniques is what’s made gaming really good for them.

                            Yeah, I've read this entire thread (blorb help me), and I still don't really have any idea of what Sandra considers to be "traditional mechanics" or "traditional techniques."<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Many, many games have some elements of the setting that are hard-prepped by the GM, while other elements are either improvised on the fly by the GM, or can even be authored by the players. Is this <i>inherently</i> problematic?<br/><br/>I'm thinking of Burning Wheel. I've experienced serious problems with BW play, but not really related to the issue of, er, blorbiness. People I've played with generally understand intuitively that some setting info is pre-prepared, while some of it is generated in other ways. What matters in BW is the focus on the characters' Beliefs, and the bad stuff is anything that gets in the way of that focus.                        </div>

                            Yeah, no, sorry, that hypothesis completely contradicts almost all, if not all, of my best gaming experiences.<br/><br/>It just... isn't that hard to get across to people what they can expect to be hard-prepped, and what they (or the GM) can author on the fly.<br/><br/>Besides, in these games I'm talking about, we generally *don't* have completely trad tech at work. Now that I have your list of criteria, Burning Wheel does not have all that much information separation (dramatic irony is a MAJOR principle of the game), and most players don't seem to play it in identifying stance.<br/><br/>So, <i>if</i> your hypothesis is that, <i>when</i> all five "trad tech" elements are in play, then play must be blorby to be satisfying, that's fine, because Burning Wheel (for example, though it's not a random example—it's very important to me) isn't entirely trad to begin with.<br/><br/>Even PbtA games, while <i>more</i> trad tech than hippie, explicitly does <i>not</i> make the GM the world-builder. The rules of AW specifically make the players, from the very first scene of the very first session, and even during chargen, the world-builders. That sets the expectation just fine. The GM creates and runs the threats / fronts, sure, and maybe some NPCs. But PbtA does, in fact, disrupt your 5th criterion, quite heavily.                        </div>

                            I think that you need information separation for that, but not necessarily blorb. If I’m good at making stuff up on the spot, you can still have a great time discovering it or interacting with its denizens.                        </div>

That was the exact playstyle I had for twenty years. So that has been thoroughly experimented with.<br/><br/>Interactions are much more solid and consequential when there's solid blorb underneath, and resolutions are also more solid (finchian/lawsian rather than just "Everway drama"; which tended to lead play subconsciously a long a path I subconsciously had dreamed up).                        </div>

I'd argue that the very fact the no-one, not even Silmenume, can tell to what extent the elements are improvised or prepared, argues strongly that they're improvised to a significant extent. I think that precisely because of the value of preparation in making things feel real, GMs will often misdirect the players into believing more is prepared than actually is, and almost never in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>Without a GM open about his methods, I think the best indication of fidelity to preparation is something like Paul's moon marooning story: something that, in retrospect, makes perfect sense in the context of circumstances and decisions made, while still feeling uninteresting, or directionless, or unsatisfying.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a>, do you know the story I'm referencing?

                            Is that fair, though? Once we're past the first session, an AW game often "reverts" to a pretty traditional playstyle (with the player contributions helping cement buy-in), with prepared Fronts/threats, countdown clocks, and other rather "traditional" forms of GM prep. I'd argue that AW's "first session" advice is quite non-traditional, but the rest of the game is far closer to "traditional" than what Sandra is talking about here (e.g. GMless, collaborative, no-prep, no hidden information, etc).                        </div>

That was the exact playstyle I had for twenty years. So that has been thoroughly experimented with.<br/><br/>Interactions are much more solid and consequential when there's solid blorb underneath, and resolutions are also more solid (finchian/lawsian rather than just "Everway drama"; which tended to lead play subconsciously a long a path I subconsciously had dreamed up).</div></blockquote>
Boy, can I relate to "lead play subconsciously along a path". So true! A great metaphor.<br/><br/>However, have you ever played in an improvisational style where a) the players have far more input into the improvisation (e.g. the first session in AW), b) where the mechanical resolutions are solid, grounded, and objective (e.g. Burning Wheel, other strict "conflict resolution" games), or c) with an entirely different creative agenda in mind?<br/><br/>What have your experiences with that kind of play been like?<br/><br/>(My experience is that any of those three can be sufficient to undercut that "Everway drama"/subconscious path style of play. Get all three at the same time, and it's not even a possibility.)                        </div>

<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/shimrod" rel="nofollow">shimrod</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Without a GM open about his methods, I think the best indication of fidelity to preparation is something like Paul's moon marooning story: something that, in retrospect, makes perfect sense in the context of circumstances and decisions made, while still feeling uninteresting, or directionless, or unsatisfying.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a>, do you know the story I'm referencing? Do things like that happen in your game?</p></div></blockquote>
I read the link that Sandra was kind enough to provide.  To answer your question in short - No.  Never once can I remember a game that came anywhere near to what Paul had described.<br/><br/>Now the longer reply.  Our chosen <i>style</i> of game is epic heroic.  A slow death to the elements just isn't part of the experience.  FREX - instead of the piece being irrevocably broken it might just be badly damaged and need time to be repaired.  Time that is not in abundance due to an extremely limited oxygen supply.  We would also find that the planet wasn't so uninhabited afterall.  So now we've got a ticking clock, a possible way out, action/hostile foes and longs odds on hope.<br/><br/>Just before I joined the group there was a scenario that was very similar to what Paul described but set in ME.  A ship had been caught in a storm and blown to a deserted island.  The ship had been damaged and needed repairs to be seaworthy again.  Food and water were in short supply.  To keep thing moving the players had to explore the island for supplies whereby they found not one living creature.  They quickly surmised something "bad" was on the island and raced against time to build a small stockade as the sun relentlessly trekked across the sky.  Sure enough there were ghouls on the island and to make matters worse a PC had got caught outside the stockade when the sun went down.  Apparently it was a new player and his face got so red (and a vein starting bulging on his forehead) that the GM actually stopped running to ask if the player was OK.  Apparently the fear was this player was going to have a stroke or a heart attack.  Seriously.  Needless to say his character died a hideous death.<br/><br/>However after the game when asked what he thought of his experience.  He answered, hands trembling as he lit up a smoke, "That was the most amazing experience of my life.  I'll never do that again.  I play to relax."<br/><br/>I'm sure this is obvious to anyone whose read any of my AP posts, we don't play a Klockwerk game.  Situations are always introduced to increase levels of tension.  One of the techniques our GM uses is to have at least one and usually several NPCs with the group to create or ratchet up conflict so all conflict isn't always just environmental - that being monsters or nature.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Jay,<br/><br/>I think that's a perfect example of how non-blorby techniques (e.g. "have at least one NPC to create or ratchet up conflict") can be used to augment a game, even (perhaps especially!) given traditional resolution mechanics and a GM/player split. I know that's not what you were trying to do, but it's a really good one. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I generally think that different people prefer different things and different games are made for different players with different tastes and have different design goals. To me it all comes down to preference.<br/><br/>I have definitely had the feeling some people are expressing, where I love PbtA games but I wonder if it’s possible to make them a bit less wiggly and fiat feeling. I’ve played and MCed PbtA probably only a dozen times so take the following with a grain of salt. I always felt like if a PCs character happed to die it would be because of a choice I made as a MC rather than a natural result of the mechanics. <br/><br/>Maybe I didn’t understand the rules well but that is how it felt and there’s something I don’t like about that. It takes away the true danger of the situation and makes character death into a player’s decision (the MCs) wherein death doesn’t seem random and there could be bad feelings between players. <br/><br/>I would like a PbtA game where the real risk of death was present and things were a bit more cut and dry, and didn’t feel so dependent upon the MCs improved choices. The game I MCed was The Sword, the Crown and Unspeakable Power, which is a great game. I’ve also played AW and DW. Maybe I MCed it in a different way than typical? Is this impression I’m getting accurate or is death more a cut and dry and the result of game mechanics and the fudging was on my end? <br/><br/>Maybe it is the sense that your making up enemies on the spot sometimes, which can feel arbitrary, rather than preparing the encounters beforehand. It might be nice to do a sandbox kind of thing with PbtA so it felt a bit less arbitrary and MC determined? Obviously, the drama is the main point of most PbtA games and character death isn’t the focus but it would be nice, for personal tastes, to make if it felt less wiggly. <br/><br/>Edit: I just read Kenny_J’s response on the “Are there non-trad, non-d&amp;d sandbox games?” which went into the idea of doing a PbtA sandbox style game. I think it would do a good job addressing some of looseness and helping to make the game feel more solid and less MC fiat dependent. Kenny’s got some really cool ideas.                         </div>

<p>I know the burden of proof was initially on me for making such a bold statement: “all games that tread on the toes of blorb need to be blorb (games that, by being sufficiently hippie have ensured that they don’t look or feel blorby don’t need to be blorby)”.</p><p>But I’ve given plenty of reasons for why I think that. It would be cool/fair if you guys (well, some of you have come around and/or some of you were already kinda with me on this) also gave some reasons beyond just “it’s been my experience that unblorbiness is cool”.</p><p>Because it sounds to me like either the blorby parts are the cool parts (the death of guy on ghoul island, once he was outside the blockades, def sounded like the application of Karma&amp;Fortune rather than Drama [to use Everway terms]), or the game is sufficently hippyfied to not qualify for the scaffolding necessary for blorbiness in the first place.</p> </div>

Yes, that’s true. I basically just mean the different general RPG game design categories often appeal to different tastes. But I definitely agree that there is a big difference between a good game and a bad game within those categories. For example, their are a lot of GMless games that just leave the players hanging and don’t do a sufficient job of reconstituting some of the stuff the GM does.<br/><br/>I was basically trying to say something like the following: I like both D&amp;D and PbtA games, and there are bad designs within those two different game design categories, but that D&amp;D and PbtA have different features and they can both be good games but just appeal to people with different tastes. But I agree that some games are better than others and if one is discussing design it’s necessary to make judgments about that if one is going to get anywhere.  <br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I’m kind of lost on this thread; I haven’t posted in a while and I’m not caught up with the topics you all have been discussing and the new jargon you all are using—I’m seriously not even sure I totally understand what the conversation is about. I think I’ll have to read everything closely to get up to speed. <br/><br/> </div>

                            This might be seem unrelated but I think a lot of Narrativist games fail because the participants don’t have a shared model for drama. You get a lot of stuff happening, a lot of hi-jinx, but it’s emotionally unsatisfying. The mechanics tend to get used to introduce ‘stuff’ rather than resolve conflicts on the dramatic level.<br/><br/>Most 90’s games fail (for Narrativism) because the situation isn’t strong and the characters are weak. There’s no shared interesting in ‘resolving the already untenable situation’, so instead the GM ends up introducing elements ad-hoc to make things interesting. The problem is that interesting is ill defined.<br/><br/>If we’re on the same page about what’s interesting and committed to playing to find out, then no-myth elements are less intrusive because the character actions are still consequential.<br/><br/>If you’re not on the same page then games like Apocalypse World create different versions of the ‘quantum ogre’ problem. Either our choice is inconsequential because the GM just fudges behind the scenes (for drama) or the resolution system ends up introducing ‘ogres for drama’ rather than actually resolving the conflict we want resolved.<br/><br/>Or to put it in entirely different terms. Apocalypse World relies on the spirit of emergence more than it does on mechanically nailing things down.                        </div>

                            I think the previously mentioned Lady Blackbird game with the dragon is a pretty good 'no blorb is good too' example. The game wasn't gelling, the laid-out setpiece wasn't really going anywhere. So, the GM pulls a dragon out, and boom - everyone is enthused and really into it. That kind of spontaneity and ability to react to the situation at hand with whatever inspires you as you go is powerful. I don't think the players' reaction to finding out that there's no myth there afterwards is especially relevant to how good the play was - that's just them being ignorant of the game - but with a clued-in group that wouldn't matter.<br/><br/>Games like Lady Blackbird work well because they give you enough preprepared stuff to springboard off and a narrow enough scenario that you don't get lost, but the implementation details are up the players/GM. The GM bounces off the players, takes their input, and outputs something that's highly tailored to what they want to do. <br/><br/>There are narrativist games that I think would be improved by blorb as well. Off the cuff - the ones that would be improved by it are games where NPCs have an independent mechanical existence (stats, I guess), or where the solidity of the setting is important. Poison'd is the first thing that comes to mind, and I've run it enough times to know that my make-it-up-as-you-go approach generally doesn't improve things.<br/><br/>More freewheeling games are fine without this - having the GM freely incorporating ideas they crib from the players and reintegrating stuff that comes up offhand is a powerful technique.                        </div>

Ok! I'm going to keep being a contrarian. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The only reasons I've heard so far are that "blorby play feels more tangible" (debatable, but true for many, sure) and that "you might set up the wrong expectations, for people who've played games in that style before". The latter is either easy to fix or not an issue at all, in my opinion (counterpoint: if your experience with trad roleplaying is all 90s storyteller mode and Quantum Ogres, why would you expect any blorb at all when you see traditional mechanics? you might expect quite the opposite).<br/><br/>Are there any other problems or potential failure points?

That's a very fair question. I think we've been covering a lot of them in these conversations, but I can reference a few. I think <a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a> basically has it, in their rather more pithy statement, above, but we can expand:<br/><br/>* The example of "the NPC to create drama" Jay described is a good one. There's nothing at all blorby about either a) making sure there's always an NPC around who could create drama, nor b) using that NPC to create drama whenever it's needed.<br/><br/>The benefits over strict blorb seem pretty obvious, too: there is always tension and drama, and the GM can "steer" things more in that direction, to create more exciting play for the players.<br/><br/>* I mentioned the thought experiment of a version of Apocalypse World where all the "choose from a list" moves and options were randomized instead. Isn't it obvious how that would harm the game and make it worse? (It is to me; we can discuss it more if someone finds it not so.)<br/><br/>* The "ice moon" scenario, and similar frustrating experiences (TPKs, for instance) never need happen, because we can always improvise/create new material to keep the game and the story moving. (I'm fairly confident at this point that someone like Cary would have improvised something interesting on the ice moon, had that been his game, and we would have had several hours of exciting, engaging play, instead of sitting around being angry at each other.)<br/><br/>And a new one, which is huge:<br/><br/>* Working with principled prep and consistent resolution methods means that we need to, by definition, treat similar qualities and quantities the same. We can't, for example, resolve one instance of trap-finding one way and another one a different way, simply because we're not interested, the GM has a cool idea, or it's late at night.<br/><br/>If you drop that restriction, you can zoom in and out much more freely, to create tension, drama, excitement, and to follow your interests as players and as a group. You can get straight to the stuff that interests everyone, and spend more of your playtime focused on that.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>In something like 2097e, when you come to a small town looking for a particular person, we might have a procedure to follow for whether we find them or not. We might end up dicing it out only to find that, no, you don't find them, or play through interactions with other characters, while we try to puzzle out their identity. It's exciting and it challenges the players, but there is lots of room for "dead air", wasting time, or anticlimactic resolution.<br/><br/>In a game like AW, the MC has the tools to offer the PCs an interesting dilemma instead ("offer an opportunity with strings attached", or something like that) and then frame an exciting and dramatic scene with that person, set up to maximize the potential for interesting interactions, danger, romance, and thematic weight. (Instead of finding them in a random place and at a random time, we can think like a movie director and "find them" at dusk, with their child in their arms, bleeding to death.)<br/><br/>By the way, I agree 100% with <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">@Jeff_B_Slater</a> that most PbtA games are far too "loose" and dependent on MC judgement for proper "blorby" play. I'm not happy with how I expressed my thoughts on the matter back here, but we had a lengthy debate about it a few years back, and I still stand by my position:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18672/is-aw-suited-to-gamist-challenge-based-play/p4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18672/is-aw-suited-to-gamist-challenge-based-play/p4</a><br/><br/><br/>EDIT: one more<br/><br/>* The ability to adjust the game on the fly (and quickly) to suit player interests and priorities, in ways that allow us to get to the 'good stuff' fluidly and efficiently, even if we started out with the wrong premises (by accident, or due to lack of skill). We can adjust to each other easily and in real time, and expand into new areas in a way which having to retool the ruleset and prep doesn't allow without a lot of work, not only in the game itself but outside of playtime, as well.<br/> </div>

For me, the benefit of unblorb is that you can pack a full story arc in few sessions, while having most moments of play be dramatic and pointing to the premise. You don't waste time fighting filler monsters or undertaking routine tasks for the sake of fairness or internal consistency. Most of us get feed on stories constantly and have a gut feel for dramatic moments, and that's what many of us appreciate in a game. Could I play 20 sessions until a character survives long enough for a story to develop and a climax to build up, purely for diegetic reasons? Not very likely. The epic campaigns I've had in 10-12 sessions, sometimes even less, with DW, BW or AW would undertake many more sessions with blorby play.<br/><br/>Me other argument is that roleplaying is telling stories around a campfire, with rules. Many of us instinctively know that this is all made up in the spot, that no SIS exists prior to the act of play. The game and the world and the story are the words we speak. Thus, games operate on a narrative logic where different rules dictate what we may or may not accept as a valid outcome. Here, it's all about narrative and even this focus on blorby content is a narrative genre. So, applying narrative rules like moves isn't "arbitrary", it's in fact quite consistent when well executed, because we all have a sense for climax, pacing, spotlight, drama, etc. It is a style to be practiced and refined as much as the discipline required to GM a blorby game. And the effects of perfectly nailing the scene towards which the tension's been building is perfectly evident in players' reactions.<br/>I'd argue that players need discipline even when they mostly play their characters in story games. I've had players ignore baits for flags they had stated, portray their characters in weird ways they can't justify. So even in traditional story now games, players have a HUGE responsibility if they want a great campaign to unfold, so that's already a big difference with other traditional games.                        </div>

That hasn't?  Huh.  If you are willing, would you be so kind as to explain your thinking?  I'm rather curious why that is.  Any other posters here feel that what I've been describing in the game I play in as a rigid game either in resolution mechanics or of "story" development?

If you wish to make use of the Klockwerk in lieu of blorb or as a synonym of blorb, help yourself!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Kinda the biggest problem I had with <abbr title="Burning Wheel">BW</abbr>/ Mouse Guard. Yes it was sad that our mouse friend died but the GM kinda made that happen by putting that bird in our path. It wasn’t a <em>real</em> bird. The good part of the game was tryna play our characters to the hilt, play to our beliefs and such.</p><p>I’ve sometimes pejoratively thought the same thing about the worst of the “adventure paths”:</p><p>In the context of Robin’s Laws player types <small>(yes I know the later book he did for WotC added “instigator” and a few more)</small>, a big flaw of those types were that they all presupposed playing along with the railroad. There was no “my kick is to forge my <em>own</em> destiny” or similar. <em>Given the railroad</em>, of course I’m gonna be a “method actor” or w/e, that’s the only thing I <em>can</em> do that isn’t being shot down by the GM as being disruptive. And the book is so utterly dismissive of the method actor. “Give them some kinda weird mirror or something so they can enjoy themselves”.</p><p>The “fun” of the game becomes method acting; and given the solid challenge that <em>other real people</em> provide, that can get heavy and <em>good</em>. (Maybe that was what Sartre’s <em>No Exit</em> was <em>really</em> about: “Le jeu de rôle, c’est les autres”…?)</p><p>Hmm so even in unblorby games the good part is the solid and tangible and real part… <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" rel="nofollow">AlexanderWhite</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Or to put it in entirely different terms.

I got home, got the module, started reading it and was like “Really? We could’ve gone here and here and here instead? People prep places and not just branching events? And there was several levels below our level?” [Later I found out that the GM was bummed that I had read the module because we could’ve played on.]</p><p>That experience sorta subconsciously prepared me for the “mirror story” a few weeks later.</p><p>The counterpoint is also a really good case for transparency of method.

It’s no longer the gloracle saying you died, it’s the GM. <small>(Also when I started running the game for guys I found that they would be like “No you don’t . I don’t die.” so life &amp; death weren’t only meaningless, it was also non-existent.)</small></p><p><strong>Why is there even a mechanic for being stranded on desert islands / ice moons if not for adding serious and real [read: blorby] risk to travel?</strong></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I’m fairly confident at this point that someone like Cary would have improvised something interesting on the ice moon, had that been his game, and we would have had several hours of exciting, engaging play, instead of sitting around being angry at each other.</p></div></blockquote><p>So when I had my ice moon story when the players were drowning in a trap, I was like “I can’t find a way out of this, time to roll up new characters I guess” they said “hold on we have an idea” used their diegetically deduced assumption that traps reset at dawn and their magic cello to conjure a waterproof cottage inside the cistern to wait it out and then barbic inspiration to force the cistern door open. And when I had the second ice moon story last Tuesday I said “OK I don’t know how you’ll survive this, time to roll up a new character I guess” he spent like five minutes flipping through the PHB rereading his class features and his prepared spells and then brought out his spare character.

We have one resolution mechanic for “zoomed in time” and another for “zoomed out time”. For example resolving a week of pit fighting with three rolls. XGE p 131. (Because your life&amp;death isn’t <em>really</em> on the line in that environment and the interesting things is finding out what the fallout is from the week of fighting.

I think your other points are solid, but this one might benefit from some examples and elaboration.<br/><br/>Even in hardcore sandbox paly it is not necessary to treat all cases at the same level of abstraction, even if they are treated with the same level of seriousness.<br/><br/>Sometimes a player tries to find a hidden item by pushing a chest in case there is something under it. Sometimes they say "We spend a two days going through the building; throughout search. We use chalk to mark which places have been searched already. What do we find?"<br/><br/>However, what one typically would not do is glossing over difficulties or uncertainties with mere narration, in the style of "After travelling for days and outwitting some trolls, you finally reach the mountain. You sneak past the orc horde and find your brother on the top floor of the tower.". Unless the characters are powerful enough, the integrity of the fiction would require some representation of the risk and uncertainty.                        </div>

I've noticed this in Jay's descriptions of his game, as well.<br/><br/>My best understanding is that it likely varies from case to case (for instance, in combat, I've seen Cary occasionally use the damage rules and occasionally ignore them in favour of simple colour narration). The players, however, have full trust in his ability to make the right call and therefore sort of "assume" that there is always logic behind what is being said and played. A sort of mild self-deception.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the concept of "Mythic Bricolage" lays the groundwork for celebrating that kind of ambiguity instead of seeing it as "rule-breaking".<br/><br/> </div>

That's exactly what less "blorby" approaches allow us to do. For some styles of gaming, that's really useful and handy.                        </div>

I think the key is that, for you and your group and your game, you really value the impact that objectivity in resolution can bring. The very fact that Esmeralda turning into a vampire is very unlikely means that it's <i>so much more meaningful</i>.<br/><br/>However, for a group that doesn't value the objectivity as much, the advantage is precisely the inverse: that this cool moment - Esmeralda turning into a vampire - can happen pretty much every time they play.<br/><br/>They don't have to wait through ten sessions where Esmeralda <i>doesn't</i> turn into a vampire. They can effectively "fast forward" to the moment where she does, and play that out.<br/><br/>They're trading off <i>frequency and consistency</i> of "cool moments!" for the <i>impact</i> of those cool moments. Kind of a quality vs. quantity thing, I suppose, to put it crudely.<br/><br/>But then if you imagine that the ability to <i>come up with those moments</i> is the skill the players want to use as often as possible, non-blorby play gives them far more opportunities to do so.<br/><br/>In one case it's a rare thing that only happens when the gloracle wills it. In the other, you've removed the gloracle so that you can do it all the time, at every session.                        </div>

Yes. But the "always around" and "whenever it's needed" are precisely the qualities I flagged, and I did so intentionally. Clearly it's not necessary for your play priorities, <i>but it is for Cary's</i>. <br/><br/>Absolutely necessary, in fact. <br/><br/>Because they have chosen to make that a high priority, and they like it that way.

Exactly right! You've nailed it on the head.<br/><br/>Let me rephrase what you wrote:<br/><br/><strong>If you don't want to add serious and real risk to travel, you should remove the mechanic for being stranded on desert islands / ice moons.</strong><br/><br/>And that's precisely what this type of game does.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>The possibility for anticlimactic resolution makes climactic resolutions awesomer. And, anticlimactic resolutions are cool too. I was really into that ice moon story as you might remember.</p></div></blockquote>
So true! It's a tradeoff, though, with all the other things I'm listing. Some people like it and some people don't! I can see the appeal of both sides, frankly (as you know, I'm a big fan of "blorb" and principled prep; I just wouldn't use it in this style of gaming, where it will just get in the way of the fun).<br/><br/>So, then, where does the drama come from? You describe it well here:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>That is the bigges strike <em>for</em> blorb of all time though. If TPK’s can always be avoided and it’s all fail forward then life&amp;death becomes up to GM whim. The guy who was killed outside the stockade on Ghoul Island was murdered. If you can introduce ex machina for <em>one</em> thing, it’s always the GM’s fault when an ex machina is <em>not</em> introduced. Cary could’ve saved that guy’s character. It’s no longer the gloracle saying you died, it’s the GM. <br/></p><p>You can’t really create real create tension, drama or excitement though. Only tell a story <em>about</em> tension, drama or excitement.</p></div></blockquote>
You are so right!<br/><br/>So, then, why doesn't everyone do that?<br/><br/>1. Some people really don't want to "create real tension". They very much want to "tell a story about tension, drama, or excitement". That's more fun for them. They don't like the real tension; they like the storytelling. <br/><br/>It's a different kind of pleasure. I enjoy it sometimes. A lot.<br/><br/>2. However! Non-blorby games can still totally have real tension, drama and excitement. My favourite kind of non-blorby game has strict and solid, tangible resolution mechanics for what happens next, which puts very real stakes on the line.<br/><br/>An easy example is any game which allows you to stake your character's life on a particular instance of conflict resolution. (You've played Dogs, you said: that's a game that does this well. You can always choose to "give" in a conflict if you don't want to take more fallout. This means that your life is never on the line except when you choose it to be... and <i>that</i> becomes the rare, impactful, powerful, memorable thing, instead. Except it's based on pure player choice instead of random gloracular outcomes. In this sense, it's more pure; it happened because it was that important to you, not because the dice happened to fall that way this one time.)<br/><br/>Much like how those anticlimactic moments in "blorby" play make it even better, as you wrote earlier:<br/><br/>"The possibility for anticlimactic resolution makes climactic resolutions awesomer."<br/><br/>The version of that in Dogs is something like:<br/><br/>"The possibility of folding in any conflict means that those times when you <i>do</i> choose to risk your life for something you care about, it really <i>means something</i>."<br/><br/>That's a form of drama and excitement that's really tangible and really cool, and doesn't rely on blorb or prep in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>It's also super intense and super fun!<br/> </div>

                            Not to be contrarian, but I don't personally feel like you can have real tension because of the inherent fictional nature of the events. Unless you're like, playing with actual bodily harm on the table or something, but it's safe to assume that ya'll aren't (I hope!).<br/>It's all fabricated. It's just a matter of how you present that fabrication, and personal preference. The stakes and tension you buy into will always feel more real to you than the ones you don't buy into. Blorb isn't inherently any more real. It's just what you buy into the most. And like, this is coming from a place of that I've played blorb games, and I'm not the type who buys in that kind of way. They were the most artificial thing imaginable to me. It didn't feel at all like life. It felt like a computer simulation at best to me. <br/>And yeah. Just something to think about on the topic of "real" vs. "not real". I generally agree about things feeling more real when they're preplanned, but I take that in a totally different direction, as you know, and the whole thing is just a matter of personal preference.                        </div>

<p>Before I get into replying to Paul, I want to add something (for the purps of our mutual goal of “game design research”, I don’t think it strengthens my case). Esmeralda becoming a dracula, Abu being saved by the cult of Usamigaras, and the extended murder spree of the intellect devourer named “Cookie Tin” were memorable to me because they were story beats that didn’t really involve the PCs, they happened completely gloracularly. The players weren’t particularly impressed because from their perspective, cool things happen every game. Two sessions ago the heist, one session ago the frankenthrow &amp; the petrification was kinda overshadowed by their “Contact Other Plane” shenanigans, and last session several story beats [more challenge stories than Narr stories but I’m fine with that] similar to “mirror story”. For all the life changing magic of the mirror story in my own life, it’s kinda miraculous how often it does happen in finchian style play. It’s no wonder it happened to me the very second session I played with this kinda game.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Yes.

                            (Not caught up on the above, but wanted to add a note:)<br/><br/>Another advantage can be that, when you have confidence that the group/table will make something interesting out of anything that happens, and when certain choices aren't "penalized" (because they're bad solutions to challenges), it frees everyone up to play their characters with verve, elan, irrational desperation, recklessness, and other attitudes that can be really fun and add to the joy of the game for everyone else.<br/><br/>Lots of times you see people coming from "dangerous" and "this choice really matters" traditional-style games (especially old-school dungeon type games, for example), and they've become so used to being careful and timid that they don't do well in more 'narrative' games.<br/><br/>The adventurer who enters a dungeon and starts checking every floor plate with a 10-ft pole is very effective at surviving. But they make a *terrible* protagonist in an "action movie" kind of story, and same goes for a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Removing certain elements of "blorb" and allowing a more freewheeling approach can really free up players to play characters who are interesting and don't make "optimal" choices, which are often the most interesting characters in our favourite stories.<br/><br/>That can have quite an impact on games, as well.                        </div>

Ooh! OK. You'll have to explain that, then, because I don't know how you'd do that.<br/><br/>In blorb play, you can often end up in a situation (to continue the metaphor) where there is no longer an NPC around to create drama. When that happens, you have to stick to your prep - you can't just introduce a new one to suit your needs.<br/><br/>So what do you mean?
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>No, my point is that traditional games played unblorbily has the mechanic, sees the mechanic do it thing, but then flinches on the outcome and cheats the situation. Which is bull.</p></div></blockquote>
Oh, yeah, that's not fun for me either. (I don't know whether I should take a stance on this as some kind of objective truth of gaming, though... I'd have to think about that.)<br/><br/>But a game can have all kinds of traditional elements but not "full blorb". Sorcerer and Apocalypse World (or whatever; pick your own example!) have a traditional player/GM split and all that but don't include mechanics for "getting lost on an ice moon". (And I would argue that it's because the designers were well aware of this potential pitfall and designed smartly around it.)
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>answer two is that blorb isn’t being taught. I had no idea how easy it was until I learned it from the blog of [OSR asshole #4], [OSR asshole #1] and [OSR asshole #27].</p></div></blockquote>
(Hehe!)<br/><br/>I'd say that "playing full blorb" is very demanding and difficult. It requires time, attention, constant tweaking (rulings, updating prepped material, etc), discipline, lots of trial and error, course correcting, and so on.<br/><br/>You do well because you clearly put a lot of time and effort and thought into it. For some people, it's very impractical (maybe they have no time to prep at all; maybe they have a learning disability - whatever).<br/><br/>It's not an "easy" approach; some other, looser approaches are much more practical for people. That's also a significant advantage.

I agree with you there! Absolutely.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>But it does rely on blorb prep. The town and the NPCs and their dice pools are prepped. Blorb prep is why Dogs works.</p></div></blockquote>
No, not at all. It's simply an example, first of all - there are many such forms of "tangibility" in non-blorby games, and, for me, at least, Narrativist play depends pretty heavily on them. <br/><br/>But, more importantly, the dynamic I described wouldn't be any less true in a game that didn't have prep but used Dogs mechanics. The fact that the GM is expected to prep a Town doesn't change that fact. (It occurs in other ways in Apocalypse World, for instance, even in the first session. And, in theory, it could come into play in an initiation conflict in Dogs, too, which is explicitly unprepped in any way.) <br/><br/>The prep here is a total red herring; the key is that all kinds of interactions in play can result in tension, drama, and uncertainty. Sticking to principled prep is just one of many ways to achieve that (and, for many people, a highly unreliable way to get there, depending on what they value or care about).<br/><br/>(Remember <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20681/burned-at-the-stake-rpg-ruleset-for-passionate-characters-at-risk" rel="nofollow">these rules</a>, for example? They don't need principled prep to feel dramatic and exciting, just a character and a situation we care about.)                        </div>

                            What Emma said. There is no "there" there. It's ALL fictional. What matters is what is meaningful and how we go about achieving it.  Let us not forget that ALL of this is, at base, a very ritualized form of conversation between real human beings.<br/><br/>Definitionally blorby must require that the players inspect the GM's notes at the end of each session if "truth" is to be validated. Otherwise there is no way for the players to "know" what they experienced <del>completed</del> comported with the "real" tangible notes of the DM. Plus said notes would have to be in a form that are unalterabe.  If this action of verification of matching the physical world to the diegetic world is not taken then the argument that gloracular play indeed occured is unsupported and is merely conjecture from the players' perspective. <br/><br/>(I hate posting by phone....especially when I should be asleep!)<br/><br/>Best, <br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

<blockquote>there’s nothing routine about fighting a monster that can kill you or making sure you don’t rack up too many starvation days that can kill you.</blockquote>
Sandra, if you can't concede that:<br/>1. Some people aren't interested in random encounters.<br/>2. Fighting to death every fight for no reason is not interesting in every genre. Hell, fighting even is specific to some genres.<br/>3. Survival isn't a priority in every genre.<br/>You're kind of making for me the point that blorby play is too rigid about it's priorities, to the extent of harming the priorities of other genres.                         </div>

                            Stealing <a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume%27s">@Silmenume's</a> use of "Klockwork" play because I think it is evocative and descriptive.  I am eager to transfer the concepts I'm gleaning to my forum-resistant group and having evocative terms helps.<br/><br/>I would say my two preferred styles of play are:<br/><br/>a) No-prep (not counting day-dreaming or aesthetic prep), cut right to the drama, frame every scene around a core theme or premise. (I call this Narrativist but I know that's a loaded term).  Kingdom, Follow, and my fav PbtAs (AW and Masks) do this well.<br/><br/>b) High-prep, what's on the page can't be changed (I mostly run adventure sites by <a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">@Fuseboy</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">@Thor_O</a>, etc ), pacing is baked into the rule-set, follow the players around and adjudicate as transparently and consistently as possible.<br/><br/>These are both fun for totally different reasons.  I love the feeling of "getting it right" by adding in a plausible, well-foreshadowed twist in a system where you have the leeway to introduce new elements freely.  I also love when my hand is off the wheel (like the randomly rolled vampire hunter-turned vampire) and happen to get a satisfying result.  In the latter example (Klockwork), the core gameplay loop needs to be fun, satisfying enough that I'm not drumming my fingers waiting for an emergent plot development that might never get rolled.<br/><br/>I have played some systems that are designed for relatively Klockwork play (not in it's platonic form, but there are degrees) and I like them a lot less when they GM takes a tighter rein over events.<br/><br/>For example, Torchbearer is my go-to system for this kind of play.  However, it sometimes falls pretty far short of this bar.<br/><br/>In one scenario, the GM has a map of dungeons prepped and says "Here are the travel rules.  Go for it."  It's totally up to the players which dungeons they engage with, when they retreat to town, how they address the threats at each location, etc.  This allows for nearly full-Klockwork play.  They risks and rewards are tangible and the GM has no tools for steering them in one direction or another.<br/><br/>In another scenario, the GM shows up each week with a dungeon prepped and tells the players how they get hooked into the adventure.  I often end up playing in this mode; it's the only way to playtest an adventure site on a reasonable timeline, or run for only a couple of sessions without wasting prep.  The Klockwork factor here is way lower.  It still works, and the players have plenty of leeway in the environment (there's no hard-scene framing by the GM after the adventure is started) but it's a significant difference.<br/><br/>My other example is complex enough that I am going to make a new thread.                        </div>

                            Good workshoping going on and I've missed so much. A bit metaphysical at times (the reality of fiction etc.) ;p <br/>Simulating a world or a story genre, the random generator of dramatic incidients, all this reminds me of Spinozza's physics : there are things and the relations between things, which are a sort of thing in their own way. This kind of distinction really benefits from being cleanly built from the ground up. Else, we navigate between clouds and dice but without knowing where the interlocutor is.<br/><br/>I want to emphasis a point : that you can (and I'd argue it's always the case) have the whole table merely move air only half heartedly, and then a ping pong ball could float on that air stream, and that's when things begin to feel real. I like a good "(fishing line) plunger" mechanic to detect this moment, Rickard's postural vote in Imagine being my model at the moment. There's no more reality before than after. It's called intensity, and it's common to take it for truth or reality, because it's really convincing. "Intensity" meaning is wider than "fun" (a useful distinction when talking about character death).                         </div>

<blockquote>I don’t think in terms of “genres” since it’s more of a trip than a “story” </blockquote>
But you're aware that, other than as a metaphor, the act of roleplaying is not a trip, but a collective narration, right? Not talking about agendas and any of that stuff, but of the social act of playing. If an anthropologist were to observe us while we play, he wouldn't say we're having a trip.<br/>So, for me, talking about genres is actually more pertinent in my opinion. And that is the blindness I don't like in the sandbox movement. Theirs is, too, a narrative genre with verisimilitude rules.                        </div>

                            I guess I lost that awareness after suffering from it under 20 years thinking it was all narrativium and then suddenly got deluded into thinking it is real and am currently 100% delusional.

                            There's nothing wrong with 'narrativium'. Some people just buy into different narrativium than others do. I'd chalk it up in a lot of ways to differences in world view, thought processes and preferences with fiction. <br/><br/>For instance, my anti-immersion techniques would likely ruin things for you,  but for me they work above all else because I don't approach fiction immersively and am not a believer in traditional immersion because of my views on the political role of fiction in society.                        </div>

Is it a problem just for you as the DM (not enough surprises)? Or for the players as well? Are the players aware that there's no randomness?                        </div>

                            On the topic of PBTA games and player expectations:<br/><br/>A couple years ago a friend of mine ran a big Dungeon World campaign in a West Marches style.  This was a wilderness exploration game with an open table, two GM's, multiple games per week, etc.  I played in a dozen sessions out of around 50.<br/><br/>This game was in "full-blorb" mode.  My friend and the other GM prepared everything extensively and shared all their notes to keep things consistent.  They made a bunch of changes to the moves and playbooks of Dungeon World to remove anything that involved making things up on the spot, and though I did not see the GM-side rules, it's my understanding that they also added more detailed rules and guidelines to the game about which moves could be used in which circumstances, in order to ensure the world worked consistently when switching GM's.<br/><br/>From my point of view the underlying consistency / prep / no-fudge attitude was obvious.  Telltale signs included (as Paul would predict) occasional boring sessions where we went out exploring somewhere and didn't find much of anything, and the occasional player death due to bad decisions and bad dice rolls.  This was very much what I had signed up for and I thought it was obvious that this was what the game was going to be like from the GMs' pitch.<br/><br/>However, there were other players who had a very hard time accepting the fact that the GM would not contradict his rules or prep.  This was especially the case with experienced Dungeon World players.  There was one player who was always at odds with the GM, trying to insert his own ideas or getting frustrated when his solution to a problem was foiled by the hidden parameters of the problem.  There were one or two other players who blamed the GM when their character died (although they had gone into an obviously dangerous area and performed obviously dangerous actions).  And there was somebody else who complained the GM used the "deal damage" move too often in combat, rather than offering them interesting choices.  Several of these players quit the game in frustration.<br/><br/>So, this game was a case where the presence of a game with non-traditional mechanics (Dungeon World) caused (some) players to have the wrong "anti-blorb" expectations.  Basically the opposite problem to the one this thread has been talking about.                        </div>

                            I think it’s the opposite of what you’re seeing, actually. (Although, of course, I’m just guessing too!)<br/><br/>It’s not 90s style, where the GM acts to present a story. It’s 2010s style, where the players expect the GM to “draw maps but leave blanks”, to make room for collaborative improvisation. The GMs took a more “blorby” approach, so they stopped “leaving blanks”. The players got frustrated because they didn’t get to participate in some collaborative improvisation anymore, but could only interact with the GM’s prep. There were no more blanks to fill, so the players couldn’t contribute in that way anymore.                        </div>

                            I want to mention that "it is not real" is a red herring. The relevant question is not about things physically existing. The relevant question is what kinds of ways of finding out what claims about the fictional situation are true there exist.<br/><br/>In a game where narrative right, from the game master or a player, determines what is true, the only way of answering questions about the fiction are asking whoever has the right to declare that. Most games assume that people will also keep the fiction internally consistent, which means that questions can also be answered by looking at what has been established. But if something has not been established, then there is no a priori way of finding out how it will be.<br/><br/>Sandboxy games try to have as much determined by other means as possible - the established fiction, preparation and procedures. Fiat is used as little as possible, which is still a fair deal, but often mostly for inconsequential details (colour in jargon).<br/><br/>Essentially, the ideal is that rights of narration should not matter at all, because the relevant decisions are not based on that.<br/><br/>OSR play has a referee because it is a game of exploration and making decisions under uncertainty. Otherwise it would be very easy to run without a game master.<br/><br/>Sandboxy play is more "real" in the sense that we can see what is real by looking at the adventure module or other prep, and anyone could look it up and come to more or less the same conclusion. Anyone could roll on the wandering monster table, or the "who rules over this village" table, etc. Or if one is playing a modern game set in the real world, anyone can see where the nearest grocery store or hospital is, or how long would it take to drive from here to there.                        </div>

Yes, this was probably part of the cause.  Like I mentioned the GM's had some additional rules and procedures that they were using that were not player-facing.  (That was part of the premise of the game--you are exploring a mysterious world, you don't know its rules, can you figure them out and use them to survive?  Which is common for some things like the random encounter tables.  But they may have taken the principle too far in some cases.)

I <i>think</i> more of the latter in this case, especially for the one player who wanted to narrate his own solutions to problems.<br/><br/>Maybe a bit of the former too.  The players upset about dying may have been used to GM's fudging results to save their beloved characters.<br/><br/>I can't give a completely certain answer since it was a few years ago, and it is about the expectations of other people who are not me, and I heard about some of these complaints and conflicts second-hand from the GM.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I should mention that the majority of the players did understand and accept the blorby (clockwork?  that's a good word for it) nature of the game.
<blockquote>I’m learning about Freebooters of the Frontier which seems to be more of a blorby take on DW?</blockquote>
I think the GM in this game mentioned he had looked into that but found it was designed more for randomly generated wilderness adventures than for the full Ben Robbins deep history approach.  He may have incorporated some material from it though--I'm not certain.                        </div>

Well, then we're talking again about a subjective state inspired by narrative or even scenic techniques, which supports my assertion that sandbox/blorb is a genre like any other.                        </div>

                            There’s another old debate here, too:<br/><br/>When you’re “inside”, or “living the fiction”, what rules does it operate by?<br/><br/>For some people it’s “real” when it obeys the expectations of reality (realism, simulation, etc). For some people it’s when its rules are consistent and immutable, so they can weigh the consequences and make smart decisions. For others it’s when it is presented to them in a way that’s similar to how they would experience it “if they were really there” (Finchian trap-finding, Jay’s game). For a lot of people, though, it can also be because it obeys the rules of familiar fiction or stories. (For example, you can imagine yourself as Spider-Man rescuing innocent people in New York, and that feels “real” to you. The moment you punch a bad guy through a pane of glass, though, and he dies from infection from all the cuts, that’s... no longer *right*. The “real” Spider-Man world you were in until now has just been broken and you’re back at the table, annoyed at the papers and dice and what your friend just said.)<br/><br/>For some people, things feeling like a familiar story *is* what brings them to that feeling of “I was really there”!                         </div>

That was sort of always the difference between Marvel &amp; DC (back in the sixties, these days they're more similar to each other). These types of mistakes would happen and it'd be sad and it'd feel real. The drug dealer that gets killed in Spectacular \#64 comes to mind, or the accident with Gwen in Amazing \#122. IDK, otoh you're right that those beats have some issues.

                            A question for the blob-people:<br/>How do you deal with players bored or uninterested? It's possible that you just designed a boring scenario or dungeon and players don't seem too engaged in terms of fun, even if they're invested in it because of their characters' goals. So they won't just go do something else. From what I've read, you'd resist the temptation of just improvising something interesting, like the dragon in the lady Blackbird anecdote. You just wait and make adjustments between sessions? Is it ok to change prep already written (but unused) between sessions?<br/><br/>Another question: can blorby immersion get torn apart by players portraying their characters in an unblorby way? Or this technique doesn't apply to them? For example sudden changes of personality, taking actions for extra diegetic reasons, inventing stuff about their characters that was never established, etc.                        </div>

                            I'll try a quick summary of what I've been talking about here. Perhaps it will help someone! <br/><br/>1. In Sandra's style of gaming, there is an agreed upon method (all the gloracle, prep, procedures of play, and GM style/technique) which serves as the "foundation" for play. It's consistent and solid and players know what to expect. This lends a tremendous "solidity" or "tangibility" to play which is enjoyable, and makes things feel more "real".<br/><br/>2. Some people don't care about solidity and tangibility and just want to tell stories in a freewheeling way. That's cool, too, but it's not what we're focusing on here. (In this style of gaming, we trust the players' judgement to make choices matter, instead of the procedural mechanics; instead of saying "here's a format for making choices matter", we say, "I trust each of us to make each others' choices matter by taking them into account as we create story". Just like "bad blorb" play, this can fail, but it can also work.)<br/><br/>3. In Narrativist play that seeks to feel real and solid, though, how does that work? Much like all the klockwerk which underlies 2097e, we need a solid foundation which grounds the game and makes choices matter. It's consistency of player roles, advocacy for characters, and consistent, principled resolution. I trust that you will play my opponent to the hilt, and fairly, while we have pre-established rules for how they interact and how we find out who "wins" or how it all turns out. We don't need to prep distances on a map, traps, or combat stats, because the conflicts we're interested in don't concern those things. We don't need rules for getting stranded on ice moons, but we <i>do</i> need rules for what it means when your character is willing to lose their life to stop mine from doing what he wants to do (for a simple example; each game will be different).<br/><br/>Once we establish the groundwork for these conflicts and solid, consistent methods for resolving them, we get emergent outcomes and exciting "real" play, just like with blorb methods.<br/><br/>(GM-as-storyteller, 90s play fails on both counts: first, the GM doesn't necessarily lay the groundwork for conflicts and stick to it, and, second, the methods for resolving them are either not consistently applied or hopelessly obscured. So this is very distinct from that.)<br/><br/>In those conversations about "what differentiates AW from traditional play", we talked about quite a few of these things. Unlike GM-mediated task resolution, which is famously open to interpretation and "cheating" (like the classic case of the GM asking for more and more rolls until you succeed), AW has all kinds of rules and procedures which produce solid, tangible outcomes we can't cheat around.<br/><br/>Good examples include that a) NPCs don't and can't arbitrarily have different numbers of hit points, and b) certain moves guarantee the PCs can hurt them reliably (so no NPC can be bulletproof), c) all kinds of moves guarantee players access to reliable and important information (like the reading moves, deep brain scan, and many others), and d) many rules and moves simply give the players the ability to create and state immutable facts about what things are and what they mean: for example, an advanced seduce/manipulate allows you to make any NPC into an "ally".<br/><br/>Those rules and restrictions all work with each other to produce emergent, tangible outcomes in a way that you don't get in "90s GM as storyteller" games. They are real and unexpected and lasting.<br/><br/>All of these design elements work against murky, unclear play, and ruin the possibility of a railroading GM trying to create the story they want. Add the explicit principles of play and play culture surrounding the thing, and you get something which is very, very distinct from 90s trad games, despite having lots of similarities at a level of procedures and techniques.<br/><br/>It's a nice middle ground between total No Myth and "full blorb", and it's a really fun and popular way to play. <br/><br/>You can get similar play from even more traditional rulesets if the GM is able and willing to adopt a strict and principled approach to how they create and adjudicate situations. This can look nothing like "blorb", but is similar in that it can be an objective and consistent, principled means of creating opposition and conflict which makes everything in play feel "more real".<br/><br/>In short, Sandra's objections about "non-blorb" play degenerating into 90s-style "GM moves the goalposts" nonsense are not entirely wrong (that can totally happen!), but they're trying to paint in black and white what is actually a wide spectrum that has so many different positions for a variety of fun and cool play, in different shades of grey.<br/><br/>(Again, Critical Role is a pretty fun example, in some ways. I see no reason to think that it's full-on "railroaded", linear play, but it has elements that are incredibly anti-blorby. Despite that, people clearly are enjoying themselves a lot. It's far less principled in this sense than AW, but neither is it "blorby", and certainly isn't a morass of horrible "GM moves the goalposts" nonsense which doesn't seem real to anyone. I see no reason to assume that if it was made "more blorby", the participants would enjoy the game more. Same goes for Cary's game. It would be a tradeoff, in both cases. They would gain some things and lose others - others that they really value.)                        </div>

                            Hi! I usually just lurk, so this feels sorta awkward.<br/><br/>I share 2097s view that playing ttrpgs blorbily is very different from telling a story (or reading a story for that matter). It's still fiction, but the way I'm interacting with it is very different. <br/><br/>I remember my first contact with ttrpg "realness" and I think it's an interesting datapoint, because its almost the opposite of the mirror story.<br/><br/>We played DoD Chronopia, a truly unblorby 90s style game. The GM admitted to changing the stats of some soldiers once to save our lives. <br/><br/>Me and another player were escaping a dungeon. We'd been kidnapped by an unknown organisation and I figured we'd find some explanation of who they were and why we were there. We pretty soon came to a room with several doors (the GM painstakingly drew it up for us) and we opened one and anti-climactically found ourself out in the city once again. <br/><br/>It was a worthless story. The prepped map and our choices had been respected to the detriment of "excitement" - and I was thrilled! That dungeon was a real place with doors that opened up to rooms that we'd never see. It didn't have a satisfying narrative arc - and it felt like real life. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

Ok, that's an interesting example. What I read here is the players were unclear on what the principles of this style of gaming were.<br/><br/>I'm late to the party, but what happened there was everyone except for one player being thrilled with the improved nature of the solution, while that other player was not.  So that's really a case of differing views within the group itself.  Just to clarify.  I'll go as far as to say that his previous experiences with other, more prepped games brought him to the table with a specific set of expectations that weren't Blackbirdesque.                        </div>

This seems like an incredibly convoluted mind exercise only built to prove your point. Every step further you make away from chess rules makes it look more and more like fiction, and those awkward restrictions at how players signal their actions end up being a collective narration. For instance, if you were to explain the game to me like this, I'd instantly suggest dropping the names rule and having the board visible to everybody. Why use that, if this isn't fiction? I don't intent stories while playing settlers of Catan, it's a waste of time.<br/>I'd rather ground the discussion in actual play experiences.<br/>Take the standpoint of an external observer. He didn't read that over complicated explanation. He's just exposed to what they're saying and doing. He hears your example:   "Alice from Village of Homlett to Cave of the Blue Medusa," you say, "Alice walks from Homlett to the Cave," and I say, "They're two miles apart, so that'll take about 40 minutes. In that time, the water pouring into the cave rises another foot and a half."<br/>What is it, from a linguistical perspective? A narration. It's oral, shared, and participation is limited by rules. Is it a game, too? It has some elements common to games, but rules can fluctuate a lot ("physics") and there's no clear winning condition.                        </div>

It's possible that you just designed a boring scenario or dungeon and players don't seem too engaged in terms of fun, even if they're invested in it because of their characters' goals. So they won't just go do something else.</p></div></blockquote>
We just had a talk at the end of previous session during which touched two points: The first is for players to take initiative if they want more to happen, and the second is for me to be more streamlined when they are approaching a dangerous location.<br/><br/>I have not really faced the situation you specifically ask about. I guess the core game of D&amp;D of going into dangerous situations and trying to survive is fun and interesting enough. A couple of times when the players did not really know what they were on about they just went into a nearby dungeon and did some basic dungeoncrawling. These expeditions often affect wider events, in turn, and make them more meaningful. For example, a goblin tribe deserting the dungeon and swearing vengeance, or a respected member of a bandit group being humiliated and losing status, to take two recent examples.                        </div>

                            I think the infinite chess board example has a point, but I would start elsewhere.<br/><br/>Nowadays there are several fantasy adventure board games with miniatures. Heroquest is the old classic and I am not familiar with the new ones. Descent, maybe?<br/><br/>I played through a tutorial of one of them with a friend. I had a hero figure I moved through a short corridor and there were skeletons coming from front and back. Maybe some timer. Thinking about it as a roleplayer, the first question was if I could jump over or run through the skeletons in front of me, rather than the long slog of rolling dice to kill them. The game did not have rules for this, so no.<br/><br/>What if I wanted a similar experience, but where I could jump over or sneak past the skeletons or crush them by toppling a pillar on top of them and so on? That is what OSR play gives to me, though the fact that social situations and interaction are also part of it is very important. (That is, the domain of play or game arena includes social interaction with non-player characters.)<br/><br/>Maybe this is relevant to the storytelling discussion; I have to admit to not being quite sure how it relates to the interesting claim of Sandra.                        </div>

                            Is this exactly how you play? How is a hypothetical, non existent example more relevant than actual play?<br/>Also, please don't be pedantic, there's no need. I wasn't talking about pragmatics, and neither were you, when you asked if this is a story. This isn't university. But yes, of course it is a story: it's a recount of events. It has a narrator, it has characters, it's fictional, because you removed the board and gave names to places in the board and attached verisimilitude rules to what happens in the story: physics, causality, etc. Why then all those extra steps? Explain please the need for names to places and characters and "physics" for a board game. If those steps aren't needed, they could be removed without harming the play experience.<br/>Would a chess player recognise your game stemmed from chess? Probably he wouldn't, since that's not chess anymore, it's something entirely different. Is roleplaying still wargaming? No, it isn't.                        </div>

Because we think those names are <i>cool</i>!

Because we think it's cool af♥<br/><br/>In go which is literally just a ternary dot matrix why is there the crane's nest tesuji? because we think it's cool! why is our +3 sword called BLACKRAZOR? because we think it's cool af!!<br/><br/>in real life why is a tennis racket not called a C2? why is a toaster not called a W4? why is a pair of jeans not called a A9? because we like cool names for things, places, characters!<br/><br/>it's also easier to remember.                        </div>

Because the blackrazor sword <i>exists</i> and the venomfang dragon <i>exists</i> just as much as the F7 square in chess <i>exists</i>.  That doesn't mean that we want a non-diegetic all-dice-layer math game. "Air chess" <i>was just an analogy</i> just as the "phone grocery shopping" or the "phone bike fixing" was.

And those frozen peppers are real.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean we should be worried about the planet al-Toril invading Earth any time soon. It exists <i>in the imagination</i>. But it exists a-priori [in the, uh, "prep"] and isn't just produced ad-hoc as part as a narrative.                        </div>

"Shitty", "blob people", "deny such an obvious point", listen… you aren't being the most respectful person yourself right now. I am not trying to treat you as an enemy or trying to "win a debate", I am trying to answer the questions you had and explain how this works.

Because you have very strong pre-existing connotations to some of the words in that sentence. I don't know exactly which of the words in that sentence is tripping you up or why you'd find that sentence self-contradictory. <br/><br/>Yes, we <b>are</b> asking for <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22086/the-diegesis-easily-explained/p1" rel="nofollow">diegetic</a> coherence in an activity <code>blorb</code> that is significantly different from another activity <code>blahonga</code>; we've often used the word "story" or "narrative" for that second activity <code>blahonga</code> but obviously the words "story" and "narrative" are <i>extremely broad</i> and if you want to apply them to <code>blorb</code> also, we can't really stop you.                        </div>

I don't think they're that controversial. I guess it depends on how exactly one interprets "90s game", but I feel it's pretty clearly being used around here as shorthand for something like a game that presents itself as blorb (to make all those best moments feel real) while using plenty of no-myth behind the scenes (to avoid slow deaths on icy moons and make sure those best moments come quickly and often). Which is deceptive by definition and incoherent by definition.<br/><br/>Actually, maybe it's incoherent only if you value blorb, or value no-myth? If both are subordinate to a third goal, then maybe mixing them and compromising both isn't incoherent at all? See Silmenume's game.<br/><br/>In fact, my experience has been that for a lot of people who come into RPGs, this is the default preference.

I know you started the thread mostly from the other direction, that using these for no-myth doesn't work that well, but I think this is interesting since you're mostly talking about your love for blorb from the GM side: do you need a GM for blorb?<br/><br/>With good enough prep, couldn't you get rid of that role entirely?<br/><br/>Isn't that what RPG-like board games like Frostgrave or Myth do? Or computer games?                        </div>

                            Can you explain how these 5 techniques specifically hurt No Myth design?<br/><br/>I understand you think that if one is using them in a non-blorb game one "isn't taking advantage" of the opportunity to make the game full-blorb, but that's like saying that eggs are required to make an omelet, so anyone using eggs to make a quiche is making an incoherent meal because they're not taking advantage of the scaffolding for full-omelet that eggs provide.<br/><br/>What specifically about having one player per character or a GM role makes no-myth play incoherent? <br/><br/>Or, to be more precise: Why would Lady Blackbird be a better game with no GM and shared authority over characters?                        </div>

                            I'm really just frustrated at the dismissal of half-Myth stuff, since I love it so much. "Draw maps, leave blanks" is <i>exactly</i> what I love most of the time in RPGs.<br/><br/>There are a few key elements that need to be in place to make half-Myth work (just as for any other level of Myth). First off, obviously, the stuff that is pre-prepped can't just be ignored willy-nilly (for the sake of "story" or whatever). Second, you need to have some sort of veto process whereby people can't contradict that which has been introduced before. Essentially, you need good improv rules (this is true for no-Myth as well). When players author new facts about the setting, they have to <i>f e e l  r i g h t</i> for that world or story or for those characters.<br/><br/>One time when I was running my Burning Wheel Three Musketeers Scenario (a solidly half-Myth scenario in a solidly half-Myth game engine), two of the players created an NPC Spanish swordsman named Inigo. He was co-created by two players because he was a low-ranking guy that both the manipulative Baron and his seductive daughter were trying to use as a spy. He hadn't "existed" before the contested Circles roll that brought him forth. However, because characters like that fit so well with the genre, it was no problem for anyone's sense of immersion. Furthemore, Inigo's presence didn't undermine any of the Myth elements that are present in that scenario.<br/><br/>Now, here's the even trickier thing. You have to have an organizing principle for play that is <b>orthogonal</b> to blorb concerns. BW's principle of "fight for what you Believe" actually needs amount of both blorb and anti-blorb to really hum. There's no way to go full Myth with BW: it would rob players of too much agency, their characters of too much protagonism. But going full no-Myth is also impossible, except maybe in an initial session where you're all collaboratively establishing the conflicts and the setting. Full no-Myth is too... airy... for what BW is trying to do. (If you don't like BW, I'd say MLwM is similar.)<br/><br/>So, in the case of a well-constructed half-Myth game, what you have is not some failure to pursue an opportunity for blorb. Nor is it a full-on hippie game, though! (Those are cool, to be clear!) I never really realized before this thread just how crucial half-Myth is to making certain games work. Maybe it needs its own thread?                        </div>

                            Excellent, Matt (Deliverator).<br/><br/>I’ve been trying to get at that for some time in this thread, but you said it in perhaps a much clearer way than my attempts so far.<br/><br/>I consider “half-Myth” (or whatever we want to call it*) to be a really key and important playstyle and super fun as well as tremendously functional.<br/><br/>It’s extremely popular among a new generation of gamers and they play it REALLY well.<br/><br/>As usual in these discussions, I find the laser focus on Technical concerns to be distracting us from the “why” or guiding principles behind play itself. “Full blorb” or “full Myth” are somewhat illusory anyway, best seen as platonic ideals we as humans will never reach (and I don’t think it would produce functional gaming even if we could!).<br/><br/>Any of these techniques can be used successfully when they are employed in the right ends (the proper creative goals), and any of them can totally suck when they are not guided by a clear idea of what role they’re serving in the game (as in my ice moon story, which is as rigorously blorby as anything out there but absolutely miserable gaming).<br/><br/><br/>*: I’m not sure I see this label as representing a meaningful category of game techniques, rather than just describing something that’s not either of the other two types of game we’re talking about, which we’ve been referring to as something like “full blorb” and “90s Rule Zero GM storytelling”.                        </div>

Does Lady Blackbird have it?</p></div></blockquote><p>Information separation is when one or more participants (the “GM role”) are trusted as custodians of a part of the game state that is true but not known to everyone.</p><p>Examples are:</p><ul><li>Which card is the real card in the board game Dixit?</li><li>Which is the correct location for each player in the board game Mysterium?</li><li>How much dragon steam does a steam dragon produce in the RPG Lady Blackbird?</li><li>Does steam dragons [or any other non-player diegetic element] even exist in the RPG Lady Blackbird?</li></ul><p>Sorry AsIf not to pick on your game♥ I understand that it was a satisfying session and I am grateful for your detailed report and how you’ve followed up with more details both on how it was ran and how the participants reacted. Just grabbing a random non-pre-existing diegetic element that a LB GM introduced.</p><p>Scouring the Lady Blackbird PDF for some more examples of information separation (beyond just “create obstacles such as goblins”) what do I accidentally stumble upon instead…? Some mild stance disruption like “Do you know anything about the Crimson Sky rebels? What are they like? Is it normal for them to be this far into the Empire?”</p><p>Are these type of disruptions enough to jar it out of being a five-technique game? I dunno, for me it’s not really enough, it’s more of an annoyance than an effective affordance. It’s more like that tiny “push” word on the side of a door that’s otherwise completely designed to look like it’s gonna be pulled. <strong>For me.</strong> All of those questions are phrased as something that the character <em>could</em> conceivably know or <em>is</em> conceivably the right person to answer. “Can you control the fire as it spreads?” would’ve been an even more in-stance take on that partic question but as far as the other four questions go…</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/shimrod" rel="nofollow">shimrod</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>With good enough prep, couldn’t you get rid of that role entirely?</p>Isn’t that what RPG-like board games like Frostgrave or Myth do? Or computer games?</div></blockquote><p>I’m not super familiar with those two specific games. Hero Quest (the board game, not the Laws game) has classic information separation. Which furniture goes into which room is kept behind a screen and the info is fetched from a tiny li’l booklet, another example of offscreen game state.<br/>The “Adventure System” series (Castle Ravenloft and the like) emulates the role through a booklet that the players read together but are not supposed to read too far ahead in, and through cards that the player are supposed to shuffle and read out randomly.</p><p>The crossroads deck in Dead of Winter is perhaps an even cleaner example of that role being distributed.</p><p>Tech around this is just getting started.</p><p>In my view, the relationship blorb has to these techniques is that they are the scaffolding that you use in order to do blorb. Just like a shaman uses her drum or whatever (uh unless that’s cultural appropriation, in which case let’s change it to a punk slamming on a busted up old Ludwig kit).</p><p>I kinda love the existing toolset: it’s minimal, it’s open source, it’s DIY, it’s moddable, it’s flexible, it’s nostalgic (I love office supplies), it’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_in_space#Graphite-based_technologies" rel="nofollow">“the Russians used a pencil”</a> method of taking you on a trip to another world.</p><p>So far, I haven’t seen a fully blorb game that doesn’t use these five tools. But who knows, right? It’s cool that cutting edge game design is going on. Like a war game dork in the 90’s being all like “hex, counters, tables in books etc are necessary for a war game” and the now people are like “but semantics on cards that you can shuffle up though?”</p><p>What I’m saying is that these five techniques are tools you use for blorb. If you have ’em, do blorb, blorb’s awesome. If you’re not doing blorb, no need to do be shackled down to all five these techniques.</p><p>Can you do blorb w/o these five techniques? I haven’t seen it… <strong>yet</strong>. Hope that’s a good enough answer for ya!♥</p><p>(I know of a board game that I’ve never played that’s called The Alchemists or something similar. You use an app <em>or</em> you use a poor non-player human that just mindlessly [but carefully, because it’s tricky] performs the scripted actions by hand. That, or you could play Zendo where the puzzles can be a lot more out-there and creative.)</p> </div>

Furthemore, Inigo’s presence didn’t undermine any of the Myth elements that are present in that scenario.</p></div></blockquote><p>Ugh you’re making me have to go dig out the Burning Wheel books, to double-check Circles, from my shoe closet but wilco!</p><p>But before I go do that, my spontaneous answer is that it doesn’t sound any more unblorby than any other tier 2 truth. For example, I, very early on, put wandering monster checks in the hands of the players. (They don’t see the encounter table, but instead of me rolling and rattling some die behind the screen, I say “make an encounter check; it’s an unmodified d20 and on a 1, 2 or 3 let me know because that means something happens”.) Isomorphic to any encounter check. Diegetically / stancewise it represents them them waiting, listening, spending time… [And/or you could make a case that I should actually reverse this ruling; lower buy-in immersion but gain mood-immersion / stance-immersion.]</p><p>OK now I’m gonna go dig out the BW boox.</p><p>Man, the art &amp; format &amp; layout of these books are so great! Type design on the microlevel is what it is but these books as artifacts, wow, I can see why they are so beloved. I upgraded my revised editons to the gold edition <em>just</em> before they made the new revised edition, which, uh… <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></p><p>Circles, 378, 386. Again, I have the old gold, not the new gold.</p><p>Page 378 I don’t see anything unblorby. Do you know an NPC in this town yes/no?</p><p>Oh, wait, the example… Thor <strong>creates</strong> an Abbess specifically. That’s not really blorby.</p><p>And that also really fucks up the stances and some more of the Five Techniques.</p><p>Outside of the example text I don’t really think it’s that problematic? Reading the rules text itself on page 380, it’s “who are you looking for” (a stance-appropriate question). There’s another unblorby example text where it’s like “I think he has a villa here”.</p><p>God, this game… <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></p><p>Let me bring up as examples some similar mechanics in other games.</p><h4 id="locating-a-caster-or-other-specialist-in-acks">Locating a caster or other specialist in ACKS</h4><p>We play 5e obv but I use these rules from ACKS (gradually replacing them with 5e stuff as 5e starts covering more and more of this ground). What’s the probability of me finding someone selling a potion of healing in this town? How many level 5 characters are there in this place?</p><p>What’s the chance of me finding someone who can repair sails in a population 2000 village?

I think this is fine because it’s not in the middle of an actual session. Since you aren’t in character <em>while creating your character</em>, it’s easier to justify doing ooc stuff such as creating your aunts &amp; uncles.

That’s a consequence of my claims and radical enough to qualify as a claim in and of itself.</p><p>Before “mirror story”, I had played in extremely “immersive” games (on the surface level) in the past. No dice, no out-of-character talk, no numbers, just narration in character in the dark. All diegesis all the time.</p><p>With the mirror story the game felt orders of magnitude more real. A thousand times more!</p><p>It’s sorta like this guy’s video (which came out like three years after than my “mirror story” experience):</p><p>Immersion… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xncs1mrMV6o" rel="nofollow">this video is a pretty good summary of a bunch of theories from other fields [video games] on immersion</a>; I disagree completely with that guy’s <em>other</em> videos but that video is pretty good! Emma our resident immersion hater might dig it♥</p><p>What he is talking about is how solid mechanics are more appealing than realistic graphics.</p><p>By the time that video came out I had already split immersion up into two types myself: “buy-in immersion” and “stance immersion” [sometimes I’ve called that “‘mood’ immersion”]. (Because 2097e is an in-person game and not a video game.)</p><p>Transparency of method increases buy-in [regardless of blorb presence… just knowing <em>how the game is set up</em> helps you buy into the stakes and premises] but distracts from stance immersion. I’ve been thinking of making some sorta verifiable game record behind-the-screen app so you can postpone all the transparency of method to <em>after</em> the session. No more “roll a twenty-sided”, instead we get all the benefits of my olden candle-lit days but with also having all the benefits of the actual gloracle. Maybe such a game would’ve benefited from being simpler than D&amp;D 5e with its litany of spells and maneuvers and class features.</p><p>I was hoping to run Cthulhu Dark in a hyper immersive way, because it had simpler mechanics that could handle all cases situations, but I realized that the insight clock in it was kinda fighting against the finchian/lawsian resolution I value. If I were to play it again I’d add in a “be finchian/lawsian or roll the dice” rule. A “look to Karma before you look to Fortune” rule. Huh, that makes me think that maybe Everway is a better game for this experiment than Cthulhu Dark because it doesn’t have the players making any kind of dice-level choices at all. You do all diegetic level choices and then your stats says what’s happen.</p><p>These days I have better knowledge of IIEE and how to “set up moves” (“the ogre is drawing back his arms, swinging his fist directly at you, what do you do?”), and better knowledge on how to prep porte-monstre-trésor instead of prepping story. Drawing from a deck of shuffled, but selected and familiar, vision cards instead of rolling from an encounter table. Now I want to try this. IDK maybe that’s dumb. There’s certainly some value in having D&amp;D’s library of “physics outcomes” available to give us very specific and satisfying answers.</p> </div>

I would really like to hear from Mike Pohjola, Juhana Petterson or some other committed immersive player/GM/designer. I do not doubt your preferences, but I do doubt their universality.                        </div>

Hey I was a cowriter on the Knutepunkt book back in 2010! (A few years before the "mirror story".)<br/><br/>Yeah, a dataset of one is just an anecdote but that's just as true for them describing their experience as it is for me describing my experience. <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/><br/><br/>I did a bunch of larps and tabletops chasing this "immersion" for decades. Playing with, and running for, a bunch of the Knutepunkt dorks. Not the two you mentioned though♥<br/>But people who knew them                        </div>

<br/>Seriously?  This isn't an argument.  Its pure editorializing and indirectly an ad hominem attack of those GM's who don't play blorb or Klockwerk or what have you.  Worse it is a Strawman argument fallacy.  The "heh heh"'s indicates malice of intent on the part of the GM and that <b><i>all</i></b> such games are Participationist at best and Illusionist at worst.<br/><br/>For myself, I agree with you that sort of play can and does exist, but to claim all no-myth games are run this way is a terrible smear on all GM's who do not.  It is synecdoche of the worst sort.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>The big thing is that <strong>the blorb experience requires the five traditional techinques to work</strong>:</p>

<li>identifying stance</li>

</ul>
<p>You need them to have blorb. It’s hard to have blorb without all five of these. </p></div></blockquote>
<small>I tried to keep your formatting but I could not manage it.</small><br/><br/>Two things.  First I'm getting confused by the use of "blorb".  In one presentation we have blorb presented as very specific type of game preparation technique.  In another "blorb" is being offered as game construct much like Story is employed in Narrativism.  Finally we have "blorb" being used as a method or process of play.  Is it all the above or one or more or something completely different?<br/><br/>Second - we use <i>all</i> the above bullet points on your list in the game that I play in.  I would like to point to you of a case of non-rpg case of immersion.  When the TV series "The Fugitive" ran in the 60's people used to call the police when they saw the actor David Janssen on the street.  Some members of the audience had so bought in to the fiction aired (immersed) that they failed to make the distinction between fiction and real life.  These were not people who suffered disassociative personality disorders but your average persons.  And they were totally passive in the process.  They were nothing but audience members with absolutely no agency to affect the fiction space.  I understand that watching a TV show and playing an RPG are not the same but my point is that "blorb" was not required to achieve a mental state where people thought the fiction was "real" and "tangible".<br/><br/>"Blorb" might be a valuable technique that works for you and your group and likely many others but it is not the only path to "immersion".<br/><br/>I also in agreement with <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> about "half-myth" which is really closer to how we play.  We play in ME but the books did not detail everything square mile of ME.  To just blanket assume that because the books or maps made of ME don't show every detail before play that nothing can ever happen or be in those spaces doesn't follow.  "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."<br/><br/>WRT formalizing every possible mechanic I did follow the link to Vincent's blog (lumpley) and noted the following - 
<blockquote>33. On 2008-04-16, Vincent said:<br/>Does formalizing rules rob them of their goodness? Absolutely yes, 100% of the time.<br/><br/>You want formal rules for the places your informal rules don't cover. I've never heard of, and can't imagine, a roleplaying group taking its working informal rules and imposing formality upon them.<br/><br/>I don't know any game designers who've successfully formalized their group's informal rules, either. My groups' informal rules have informed my game design, of course, but for none of my games have I ever just written down what we already do.</blockquote>
While his general gist is that while formal mechanics help push players to unwelcome and unwanted events they also have the drawback of -
<blockquote>I think it's inevitable that playing by formal rules will mean that some of the things you want to happen in a game, can't. <i>They cut off welcome events, whole domains at a time.</i> That's one of the biggest strengths of freeform play - that's why I say that live negotiation and <i>honest collaboration is more robust and flexible than any given formal ruleset.</i></blockquote>
I think, though, that his arguments are aimed specifically towards Narrativist play.  In game negotiation of scenes is antithetical to Mythic Bricolage and, I presume, to Challenge based play.<br/><br/>I'll state this again Mythic Bricolage play does have a resolution mechanic - it's called Bricolage and it is not deterministic.  This is the very hang up that most people have with the idea of this mode of play.  Yet real world native tribes use this method to create their cognitive frame of reality.  If real humans beings do this for real purposes that underpin the totality of their cultures then why must it be any less able to create a "tangible, real" game <i>experience</i>?<br/><br/>What "blorb" seems to be is a Social Contract convention between the players and the GM. It is promise between the players that the GM will precreate everything that will happen in the game, will make their note available upon request after the game and not interfere with the Klockwerk.  Great!  It's a technique of play that really jazzes you and your players.  Can't argue with success.  But saying "blorb" is the only or even the best way to immersion is "One True Wayism" and that claim falls apart in light of my own experiences.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Playing a true protagonist in the literary sense is very much the goal of BW and many of its relatives. You need, as a player, to have sufficient agency to be able to author facts about the world. Not anything and everything, as in a true story game, but fairly frequently, IME. That's why the Circles rules being used to "create" a new NPC ex nihilo isn't some weird glitch, without which BW could be a blorby game.

Yeah, I was dreaming about BW. It's just a difficult game for me to come to grasp with because it requires a stance that from a distance do not appeal to me. You "are" the author rather than the character, but you have one character that is your primary responsibility. There's something that makes me kind of uncomfortable around that.                        </div>

<a href="http://big-model.info/wiki/Participationism" rel="nofollow">The example of participationism on the Big Model wiki uses a game where the players are participating in a prewritten Big Story.</a><br/><br/>But we've found that there are two kinds of "the GM is running the show" games; pre-written railroaded stories, and improvised Gromit tracks making it up as we go along stories. Arguably if the stories are awesome people will line up to get tickets, to paraphrase Elizabeth McCoy's old pro-railroading stance.<br/><br/>The way of a game to <b>not</b> be that, is for it to be "play to find out". There is some question, stake, entity, porte-monstre-trésor, character, dilemma, intrigue and we want to <i>find out</i> what happens rather than <i>make up</i> what happens.                        </div>

                            How we do that is pretty much the 'whole' question of design. So for instance when deciding what's in the world it’s about saliency. What I require of the GM, is to have control of ‘the salient points of the narrative’ not the whole game world. So plates might be wallpaper. Whether I steal a watch I just made up, might be wallpaper.                        </div>

                            Let’s say we’re playing Feng Shui and our characters are in a kitchen fighting bad guys.  If we construct visual images in our heads then everybody has a different ‘movie’ playing. We’re all picturing the kitchen in different ways and with different levels of detail. When I say I grab the plates I’m grabbing the plates that I see in my minds eye that are there by virtue of it being a kitchen. On the other hand the GM might say there no plates there if that’s salient. Then I revise the picture in my head.                        </div>

                            Years ago I was playing a game where I was a revolutionary in a peaceful city, the citizens ethos was all about harmony and getting along.<br/><br/>Over the course of about 8 sessions a lot of shit went down and I ended up giving a speech in front of a mob, I was inciting them to looting and violence.<br/><br/>The GM decided that no roll was required, the citizens wouldn’t riot, they were after all ‘peaceful and committed to harmony and getting along.’<br/><br/>So after the game I was pissed. Not because I didn’t get my way but because I thought there should have been a roll.<br/><br/>At the time I blamed all this on the system ‘It should have been say yes or roll the dice, then I would have got my roll.’<br/><br/>Now I think system is a secondary concern. For the system to even matter in the first place, me and the GM must have been onboard that this was a dramatic moment. That maybe my words would incite the citizens to violence, that we’d decide it with a dice roll.<br/><br/>Whether the mob would riot is a salient point and I wanted us to be in this together in finding out what would happen.                        </div>

                            I’m borderline spamming and what follows is a reiteration of a lot of what has been talked about. This is just checking we’re on the same page about fundamentals before we get to prep/information separation. <br/><br/>Imagine two people talking, making stuff up, Bob and Sue. <br/><br/>Bob: A weary traveler<br/>Sue: staggers through a desert<br/>Bob: hungry and pained<br/>Sue: on the horizon a city<br/>and so on: of lapuzi and gold<br/>the traveler shields his eyes against the sun<br/>sees the city and smiles<br/>heads towards it<br/>within the city a callous prince reclines on a couch covered in rarest furs<br/>he rings a bell of glass to summon his favorite concubine<br/>she is there in moments, all smiles and bows<br/>but when the prince isn’t looking, <br/>the faintest sneer plays over her lips<br/><br/>If they’re on the same wavelength they might have generated a lot of dramatic questions.<br/>That poor concubine, what’s she going to do?<br/>What’s the traveler after in the city?<br/><br/>Continue play will answer these questions and generate more. This is the play to find out stuff and a method of finding out.<br/><br/>Now why not just use this method instead of any other? The inertia of tradition? Yeah for the most part. I’d have a better time using the above system than say Fiasco. Is it better than Burning Wheel though?<br/><br/>Let’s put Burning Wheel aside for a moment and get more fundamental. Let’s ask what the player/GM division brings to the above and if we we’re getting really technical, along what lines we’re splitting stuff up. (Can the player make up plates, cities, callous princes?)<br/><br/>For me the rough division allows me to inhabit a character and make choices as a character, and have hopes for the character, and that’s special in a way that just narrating stuff isn’t. Why only play one? Well the biggest reason is because what do I do if two characters I own interact?<br/><br/>So that’s a case for ‘only play one character’ and ‘gm/player’ division of stuff. My previous story might also be a case for ‘sometimes use the dice’.<br/><br/>Do we agree that the above mechanics do get us emergence? They generate questions which we wants answers to and some of those questions will be decided by the player ‘what does he do?’ some will be decided by the dice in response to what a player does  ‘what effect does his course of action have?’ and some will be decided by the GM because of what NPC’s do and what elements are brought into the sis in the first place.                        </div>

I understand this. But the reason I bring it up in this context is less about saliency/wallpaper and more about stance/role-division.                        </div>

Two answers:<br/><br/><b>In the full on 90s era</b><br/>No. I didn't. I saw myself as a story teller, movie director. It was almost all improvised but I was the one spinning the yarn, wanting to surprise &amp; entertain &amp; impress them. I'd sometimes go like "OK, and now we enter your apartment... let's hear what you have in there" and have them describe their own apartment and be amused by that. That does not qualify. So I get why peeps might be "oh, she didn't play 90s style the right way", I'll add: <i>Buuut...</i><br/><br/><b>Later when I was looking for "rules"</b> just prior to mirror story<br/>Yes, my goal at this point was to reach some sorta meaningful "play to find out". We were running Fate and each scene was set in order to resolve a meaningful stake question.                        </div>

Let me <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485022/#Comment_485022" rel="nofollow">add to my previous answer</a> with not only what was going on with my mindset but also the technical practices here.<br/><br/>Most of the time we were doing diceless.<br/><br/>When we were using dice like a d20 when we were ostensibly playing Drakar or whatever, I wasn't even <i>looking</i> at the die rolls, just deciding. (Yeah I know!)<br/><br/>When we brought Fudge dice &amp; adjective scale back after a while I was kinda barely doing fail forward. More like fail-super-minor-setback. (These days I hate fail forward. I want failure to be consequential.)                        </div>

Stance stuff is the topic I'm most interested in. I started off as a myguy/immersionist but a few games really complicated the issue for me and I think I have a very different take on it than I used to. <br/><br/>Do you have any thoughts on why Fate didn't pop? Do you remember the sort of stakes you used to set?                        </div>

Like "werewolves in your office, will you drive them off or will they kill you or will you flee or w/e".<br/><br/>One big problem that isn't related to anything in this thread was how the econ would break down when there were too many or too few fate points available.<br/><br/>The few moments where it really did pop was when something was prepped a <i>little</i> more solidly.

So I'm working hard on a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21035/glossary-of-key-phrases-while-dm-ing/p1" rel="nofollow">DM phrase list</a> to fix things in as unintrusive of a way as possible.<br/><br/>So while they normally say "are there some rocks here" and I can answer gloracularly, if they say "I grab a rock and…" without asking, if there are rocks there I just think "good guess" and nod along, if there aren't I ask where they got it. I try to not sound sarcastic or passive-aggressive with my voice. Like <b>not</b> "Oh, where did <i>you</i> get a rock, you little…". More like genuinely curious. Often they can find a good answer "I go get some pieces of the broken gargoyles on lev five" and that's salient because that adds to the time it takes to do the task.<br/><br/> </div>

Awesome games have been had.</p><p>But that’s not what you’re talking about with your [raider|trader] west and your [duchess|butler|priest] murderer.

Play Lovecraftesque, play Nerver av stål, play any of a bunch of games that work with this goal.</p> </div>

FWIW, I agree with you on the last sentence. I don't think Trad techniques are necessarily good when you're trying to do something far different.<br/><br/>As far as Blorb itself, have you asked yourself in a serious way how far you are willing to go for that and why?<br/><br/>To me, a lot of this seems like a mental exercise somewhat removed from the implications of it's deployment in practice.<br/><br/>For example, I could see someone willing to commit to designing for and GMing bloboriffic play for one relatively self-contained "adventure" ( however may sessions, but a relatively small number).<br/><br/>I could see a sequel, or two, with significant time in between playing them ( it takes time to create that level of blorbiness, even employing random charts appropriate to the setting).<br/><br/>What I have a hard time imagining is a single GM committing to doing this long-term with real fidelity and neutrality with a consistent group of players.<br/><br/><br/>You've said you want to play a character in this style of game. Would you consistently, perhaps for years, commit to doing it as GM for other people? Could you foresee doing it without slipping into some of the bad ( not-very-blorby) habits you're against?<br/><br/> </div>

                            Well, let's see how that turns out.<br/><br/>Those '90s techniques evolved from earlier, presumably fairly Blorby playstyles, and undoubtedly did so for a good reason.<br/><br/>Does the wheel get re-created in some fashion, even while knowing what we now know?<br/><br/>For that matter, how hygienic is the blorbitude? How far in advance do highly detailed blorborriffic areas get created, when a big part of play is actual exploration?<br/><br/><br/>The next dungeon/town over? One in each cardinal direction, plus the ones from each of those?<br/><br/><br/>How does it work with, say, a science fiction genres, as opposed to fantasy genre, where you're dealing with the issue on a multi-planet, planet-wide scale?<br/><br/><br/>How do you avoid playing into your players' interests in the name of a consistent world?<br/><br/><br/>Now, I could see all of this working with either rotating groups but consistent "modules", possibly paired with rotating GMs and varied worlds/settings. I could see it working with, weirdly, old school Gary Gygax multiplayer campaigns with 20+ people, highly valued GM neutrality, and a fairly simplistic game concept like OD&amp;D ( Get Rich or Die Trying!).<br/><br/><br/>I just have a hard time imagining it with a less bloodthirsty concept and a smaller group size that you play with consistently.<br/><br/><br/>And, while I can see a single person committing to it as designer/GM, I just don't see how that works out well in the long-term for that person, nor do I see how it encourages anyone else to take up that same level of commitment.                        </div>

What I want is locations with problems and goals. I don't want a "funnel" type structure, I want them to be able to go pretty much anywhere. The Lost Mines of Phandelver was good, as was B4 The Lost City, and Curse of Strahd. The castle is right there on the hill, or you can go explore the country side and there is <i>plenty</i> there. I placed the Deep Carbon Observatory and Carrowmore in Barovia.<br/><br/>We've been doing a jungle hex crawl (with a couple of dungeon here and there on that hexmap) for the last year and change, and are in a big dungeon now.<br/><br/>I had an idea a while back that I haven't really tried out yet that would be sort of a compromise between creating the entire country in advance, which is what I would've <i>wanted</i> to do a la <a href="https://batintheattic.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-make-fantasy-sandbox.html" rel="nofollow">this overly ambituous setup</a>, but I've never been able to actually do that, between that overly ambitious methond vs the "create each hex randomly as we go along" method which I think is not solid enough.<br/><br/>That compromise is the <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/the_quest_queue/" rel="nofollow">quest queue</a>. That blog post is just a sketch, it needs some more codifying (exact distances per tier primarily). That way I could create new modules (using random generators online, using my own homebrew stuff, using finished modules from other people [both from WotC and from third party]) without quantuming them them or forcing them, just placing them on the quest queue. I haven't really tried it because a lot of the time I use modules where there is a lot of stuff already. A big region + a buncha dungeons.<br/><br/>I used the big region map from the railroaded adventure "Corsairs of the Great Sea" and let them loose using it as a sandbox, I had placed a buncha the Yawning Portal dungeons nearby too, but they also did explore one of the sites from that railroaded adventure. I let the factions and agendas from the railroaded adventure be true, I just threw out the timeline; just used the starting situation.<br/><br/>I experimented with "an island rises from the bottom of the sea" to change it from scripted ("when the characters reach this or that level") to be a daily die roll. "Did the island rise today" But that experiment, well, the campaign ended before that happened.<br/><br/> </div>

                            What do you do to confine play within an area to allow better blorbiness?

In game, out of game?<br/><br/>What kind of setting works best with blorbiness?

There are two different old TSR RPGs from the '80s that I'd like very much to run like you're suggesting. Each time I've tried to do so, my players tend to immediately run off the map, and I can't say I have any in-world, in-fiction reason, legitimately blorbily prepped, to stop them from doing that. Each time, it led me to improvise on the spot, something that would seem to fly directly in the face of world consistency and pre-existence.<br/><br/> </div>

I can't claim perfect Klockwerk systems, but I have an answer that reflects our attempts. <br/> We agreed as a table to stick to the region on our world map.

Yeah, but in a half-myth game, there are some / many things that are objectively true. There are some things that are nailed down, even if they remain off-screen for the time being. Typically, for example, stats of major NPCs, locations of major cities or dungeons, maybe the stats for a certain magic item. Parts of the backstory / secret history of the world. (There's even a special reward in BW for getting invested in the GM's hard-prepped stuff, the Deeds point.)<br/><br/>The thing you're missing about BW is because of your failure to consider the possibility of a fourth way.<br/><br/>-It isn't aiming for 90's style trad illusionist bullshit.<br/><br/>-It isn't aiming for "pure" story-game, where we are all 100% collaborating together to build the world and the events.<br/><br/>-It isn't aiming for blorb.<br/><br/>The thing BW is aiming for necessitates some mix of hard-prepped and improvised setting elements. I think maybe "Dramatic Protagonism" or something is a good name for it.<br/><br/>Think of it this way: to a vegetarian, you shouldn't put even a small amount of grilled hamburger meat in the meal. But to a non-vegetarian, it's perfectly fine to mix meat and vegetables to achieve whatever it is you *are* aiming for in that meal.                        </div>

When I've done this, we discussed explicitly how the game would be about exploring a given map. Nothing off-map would be played through at the table.<br/><br/>It could happen! But it would be like, "OK, Alice takes the next ship back to Amland. Alice's player, do you want to play Henchman Bob for the rest of the session? You'll need a new PC for at least 6 sessions, since the trip to Amland and back is 3 months each way."                        </div>

This map is player facing.  They follow the travel rules right on the map sheet.  We play Torchbearer, so there are player-facing rules on how to research a location or find rumors about the opportunities there.<br/><br/>The non-adventure hexes only matter when they fail a travel roll or break up travel with camping.<br/><br/>I have only gotten this style of play to work in Torchbearer because of the pace/scale of travel, lack of long range communication (in game), and the multitude of adventure sites to draw from (in real life).<br/> </div>

                            Yes, exactly. Agreement, understanding, social contract. Creative Agenda. Etc. Nothing about “blorb”, by itself guarantees good play. <br/><br/>I’m also fully on board with what Deliverator is describing. (In fact, I find it really weird that we have to talk about it all, given that the majority of Narrativist games until fairly recently ALL worked this way or fell into that “camp”.)<br/><br/>I’ve seen a lot of people come to that understanding from a limited reading of “GNS” categories, though: that “Narrativist” means we all make stuff up with no grounding basis, even though that creative agenda and those techniques have nothing direct to do with each other.                        </div>

<p>Oh, <a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a>, loving these practical questions.</p><h1 id="when-they-leave-the-map">When they leave the map</h1><p>So there are basically three techniques.</p><h2 id="just-telling-them">Just telling them</h2><p>Out of character. “For this campaign, please stay on the continent of Chult. That’s the only place that I have prepped.” If they try to leave, remind them.</p><p>If they keep trying to leave, you have prepped to small or too badly. Scrap the campaign and start over.</p><h2 id="random-encounters">Random encounters</h2><p>This works really well. They can go out and do whatever. Nearby we have tier 1 truths, if you go further we’ll have tier 2 truths. Here are some real prepped villages, further away there are random villages. Here we have some real dungeons, further away there are random lairs.</p><h2 id="some-sorta-barrier-or-wall-like-the-magical-mists-surrounding-barovia">Some sorta barrier or wall like the magical mists surrounding Barovia</h2><p>This is awful! It’s not unblorby at all—it’s actually cool that there’s a diegetic reason to stay—but it becomes really hard for the players (if they are in identifying stance) to leave these be. Trying to crack the puzzles of these mist walls ate up a couple of sessions of our CoS campaign. And it comes across as super railroady and forced even though that’s not the intention.</p><h1 id="what-are-best-settings">What are best settings?</h1><p>So a flat open map is best. Following a river isn’t great. Deep Carbon Observatory is a module that has great content but from the player’s side it <em>came across</em> as really railroady. First the events in the city flowed into each other so well that they felt linear/scripted and then going upriver also felt literally linear.</p><p>Obv lower tech = easier prep. If they have flying carpets, spaceships etc you need to prep at a different scale and a different granularity and density.</p><h1 id="can-settings-be-mined-out">Can settings be mined out?</h1><p>Yeah, we’ve had four different kinds of campaign endings, and I’ll add a fifth &amp; theoretical one.</p><h2 id="setting-mined-out">Setting mined out</h2><p>This happened in our Lost Mines campaign, they had pretty much done it all. That was unsatisfying to me because I have the attitude that if you do it <em>all</em>, you’re no longer <em>choosing</em> what you do. I think I’m gonna try hard to make “never-ending” campaigns in the future.</p><h2 id="campaign-scrapped-unfinished">Campaign scrapped &amp; unfinished</h2><p>This happened to our Princes of the Apocalypse campaign. I just didn’t want to keep running it. I loved the NPCs but the book was so hard to use.</p><h2 id="some-major-setback-led-us-to-taking-a-break">Some major setback led us to taking a break</h2><p>I’ve had three “never ending” campaigns because I had rules that allowed me to add content to them, not that we had gotten anywhere near finishing what I had put in before campaign start. al-Qadim (two separate campaigns), and my two homebrews Glitchworld and Bladen Faller.</p><dl><dt>First aQ campaign</dt><dd>A popular PC got petrified and I was just really anxious to get started with Princes</dd><dt>Glitchworld campaign</dt><dd>My fave city got burned down! So much for having a stolen car mentality, I got so bummed out</dd><dt>Second aQ campaign</dt><dd>We had a lot of players drop out (because of moving cities) and one of the parties got TPKd. Took a break from running after this.</dd><dt>Bladen Faller</dt><dd>Played one session, but one guy (a 3e player who I hadn’t played with before) was a big jerk and also it became painfully obvious that I hadn’t prepped enough, unlike my previous homebrew, Glitchworld. [Note to self: An Echo Resounding much better than ACKS when it comes to prep. But that was the experiment.]</dd></dl><p>To me the most satisfying campaign end was that first aQ campaign. We still had a lot of things to explore and we were like “OK , the campaign is in a good place, we just lost a major PC, let’s take a break from it and do something else, I really want to do Princes, it looks so cool”</p><h2 id="a-predetermined-ending-condition">A predetermined ending condition</h2><p>This, while better than “mined out”, isn’t great because it isn’t as open-ended as I like. For our Curse of Strahd campaign I had decided that the campaign would end when Strahd died. (It took a bunch of PC parties dying before that happened.) I pitched it to the players as less of a funnel, and more of a… there are a hundred loaded rat traps in this dark room. One of them is red. When the red one has snapped, we’re gonna turn on the lights and wrap it up.</p><p>My current campaign started with a similar ending condition: the campaign would end when the players have decided what to do with the soul monger and then done that thing. Try to use it, stop it, destroy it, steal it, control it, annihilate it, ignore it… whatever. But then it’s over. Buuut I think the next campaign will have a lot of continuity with this one, I’ll set it nearby and we can have a shared history with this campaign.</p><h2 id="a-predetermined-amount-of-sessions">A predetermined amount of sessions</h2><p>This isn’t one I’ve tried yet but was an idea I had. 12 weeks, only counting weeks where we’ve played at least once.</p> </div>

<h1 id="re-using-unexplored-areas">Re-using unexplored areas</h1><h2 id="quantum-placement-of-areas-in-general">Quantum placement of areas in general</h2><p>So there’s this classic example that I think is <em>not</em> legit which is from “How to be a <em>GURPS</em> GM” page 26.</p><blockquote><p>A classic example is an adventuring party traveling through the wilderness and coming to a fork in the road. Assume the GM has created a small keep as an encounter, complete with some memorable NPCs and a few adventure hooks. If the GM has already told the players the keep is along the left road, or given them a map showing the keep on the left road, then in the game world that’s where the keep is. If they choose to travel the road on the right, there is no logically consistent way they will arrive at the keep.<br/>However, if the keep was not previously mentioned, the GM can place it along whichever road the party chooses to travel – if they go left, it’s along the left road; if they go right, it’s along the right road – and as far as the game world (and the players) are concerned, that’s where it has always been. Similarly, the keep the GM created doesn’t have to be a keep. If the party knows the keep is along the left road, and they choose to travel the right road, perhaps they eventually come upon a cross- roads inn, where many of the same NPCs and adventure hooks from the keep now reside.<br/>To some, this may seem somehow sneaky or underhanded. However, enjoying an RPG is about the willing suspension of disbelief – players want to lose themselves in an imaginary world for a time, pretending to be a fictional character. As long as the wires behind the scenes, holding the sets together, don’t intrude into the game, most players don’t care much about how they get to the fun. They just care about getting there.</p></blockquote><p>To which I say… <strong>why is there even a fork in the road then?</strong></p><p>Even sandbox hero Kevin Crawford has “you should have a bunch of prepared sites in your folder to pull out” and I’m like, uh, I’m not so sure that’s legit.</p><p>I always want to move all content “through the gloracle” somehow.</p><p>I’d rather put the keep on the random encounter table than to “force” the players to visit it using those tricks.</p><p>In my game though, almost all sites are fixed to the map rather than reside on the encounter table. I’d rather try something like the “<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/the_quest_queue/" rel="nofollow">The Quest Queue</a>” if I wanted to place content randomly because of the idea put forth there: information=agency.</p><p>That said, I normally just use a map that have locations hard placed already. It’s not like it’s hard to have a bunch of dungeons placed around a town…? I don’t have to be super familiar with the dungeons before the players go there. Just skim through them.</p><h2 id="when-is-it-legitimate-to-reuse-unexplored-content">When is it legitimate to reuse unexplored content?</h2><p>If it’s a new campaign. If the players didn’t even <em>hear</em> of the site, it’s fine to just copy it over to a new location on the new campaign. If they heard about it but rejected it (maybe because they didn’t have time to go there, or because they didn’t want to go there, or they tried going there but didn’t like being there), then I ask them. That was the case in our first aQ campaign, I had placed B4 The Lost City and The Caverns of Thracia near the city of Mahabba and also generated a bunch of city stuff in there and smaller dungeons in the city, some homebrew, some stuff out of Red Tide and from a random city book. The players briefly visited the Caverns of Thracia (and lost a couple of PCs there) but decided to concentrate on the Lost City which to them was more interesting [because it was a more newly opened up area diegetically, I had decided that “a pyramid had been uncovered in a sandstorm” whether the Caverns of Thracia was more “meh it’s been there for a while” in their estimation] and also they had just had a bunch of deaths in the Caverns of Thracia.</p><p>So when I later wanted to place the Caverns of Thracia in another campaign, I asked them (ooc) for permission to do so. [In the end that campaign hasn’t started yet.]</p><p>If you’re still in the same campaign, I don’t think it’s legit. The players might still go there later. They might still go back to that left fork and go see that keep, in the GURPS example.</p><p>The “Tomb of Annihilation” module is a hexmap that’s kinda sparsely populated. It says “Feel free to move areas around so that they get in your players path” and I was like “nuh-uh, that’s against our table’s social contract” and stuck with their listed locations. (With one example: I decided (for myself, this wasn’t something I ran by the players) that IF the characters got dragged off to a goblin village, I’d use the “goblin village” location and move it, letting it stand in for “a generic goblin village” and change the name. Them getting dragged off to a goblin village, or even them stalking some goblins home to their village, felt kinda unlikely to happen and they were more likely to stumble over the real location of that particular village. [In the end neither happened.]) To fill out the hex map I added in stuff from Knights of the Dinner Table and from Fire on the Velvet Horizon.</p><p>I did feel on thin ice with that goblin village thing!</p><p>I also went through my notes and I found one super unblorby thing. One of the NPC houses that the party used for a base for a while had brewer’s tools and he was established as a brewer. There’s nothing in the module about that that I can find? I guess I thought that was wallpaper…? But we have so many rules for using brewers tools to purify water…? Not sure what I was thinking with that one!! But it’s just back to trying to do better♥</p> </div>

I'd wanna... add the new elements on some sorta gloracular "queue" such as an encounter table, to get a "disclaim decision-making" layer inbetween me and them. But since beliefs are ever-changing in BW they might've gotten obsolete by the time they happen, if they happen.                        </div>

                            Sure, I can engage with some of that. Would be happy to!<br/><br/>First of all, let me see if I can summarize what I see as arguments you've brought forward so far, and then maybe you can do the same for me. How does that sound?<br/><br/>Ok:<br/><br/>The basis of this thread is the idea that doing Narrativism (for the sake of this thread, I think this can be treated as "rpg play with an interest in an exciting story we all get invested in, as its main priority") with traditional techniques (which may or may not include blorb; not sure on that one) is a bad idea.<br/><br/>Is that a fair summation of your thesis here?<br/><br/>Now, given that, here are the arguments I think you've made in this thread:<br/><br/>1. Using traditional techniques sends the wrong expectations to the players, who may assume that "blorby" methods are being used in the game.<br/><br/>Breaking that expectation can harm the game and/or people's enjoyment of it.<br/><br/>2. Therefore, if you're playing a Narrativist game, you should make it crystal clear that it's not "blorby", and, furthermore, you should do that by avoiding traditional techniques.<br/><br/>3. You've outlined five "pillars" of traditional, blorby play, and you feel that they go well together, support each other, and create a whole that's coherent and strong and solid.<br/><br/>Is that a fair summary? Did I miss anything important?<br/><br/>Are there further points you feel you have proven (or at least argued strongly)?

I think I've been fairly clear on this:<br/><br/>* Doing "Narrativism" with traditional techniques can be challenging and difficult, and it's certainly easy to it wrong.<br/><br/>(This is analogous to how doing "good blorb" is challenging and difficult, by the way.)<br/><br/>* There is, however, an existing school/tradition/culture/design lineage of Narrativist games with traditional mechanics, and they're really fun to play.                        </div>

That is incorrect.<br/><br/>My thesis is<br/><br/>Unblorb with traditional techniques is a bad idea.<br/><br/>Corollaries:<br/>Fully blorby narrativism with traditional techniques are fine.<br/>Fully blorby non-narrativism with traditional techniques are fine.<br/>Unblorby narrativism without traditional techniques are fine.<br/>Unblorby non-narrativism without traditional techniques are fine.<br/>Extremely hippified or disrupted traditional techniques count as "without" for this purpose.<br/><br/>The whole "narrativism" thing came about because you asked me in PM if I was aware that you could do narrativism with traditional techniques. In hindsight, I should've said "yes as long as it's fully blorby narrativism".                        </div>

Yeah, that should be four, because putting "resolution mechanics" in there was dumb of me.<br/><br/>It's weird that they aren't the principles on how to run games blorby (which are, instead, the three tiers principle, the wallpaper saliency principle and the saliency time zoom principle). Instead, they are the scaffolding necessary for the "trip" experience; the classic player/GM separation pretty much.

<p>But that wasn’t the question. The question was doing unblorb (which narrativism can be <strong>but does not have to be</strong>) with traditional, non-hippiefied techniques.</p><p>For example, let’s say a hypothetical take on Burning Wheel, “Yearning Wheel” / YW, did <em>not</em> have the circles roll or the separate types of wises. The player-facing mechanics were all in support of the traditional player/GM separation and were not hippiefied. On the GM side of things, in YW, they’d still be instructed to forcefully introduce elements designed to challenge specific character beliefs. A mechanic that the player might be told about in a two minute conversation but that isn’t visible/apparent <em>through mechanical interaction</em>.</p><p>Is YW a good or bad game? For the purps of my (arguably unproven) thesis, YW is a bad game.</p> </div>

                            Gladly! <br/><br/><br/>I actually think this difference in the design of Torchbearer and Burning Wheel is a failure point for some people.  Torchbearer and Mouse Guard have a reputation for being Burning-Wheel-lite, since the have similar mechanical features (skill lists, dice pools, fate points) but the nature of prep and narrative authority are totally different.  I've read of people moving across these systems (without examining these differences) and having a hard time of it.<br/> </div>

                            Nope, I'm reading along. Your thesis is now "unblorb with traditional techniques is a bad idea" (but hopefully you can understand where I got my idea - "Narrativism with traditional techniques is bad" from, since that's the way you started the whole thread, and its topic <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ).<br/><br/>So, now, what is "unblorb with traditional techniques"?<br/><br/>I *think* you're defining "traditional techniques" as those five pillars (now four pillars).<br/><br/>I don't know what "unblorb" means. I would guess it's "not committing to salient world facts before the players have to make decisions regarding those facts", but that's my own idea and wording, not yours. Close enough or no?<br/><br/>[deleted unnecessary bit.]<br/><br/>I'm still mostly interested in some explanation/description/examples that support your thesis, so I can understand where you're coming from.<br/><br/>Hopefully that helps!                        </div>

Right, I was unaware that you could do fully-blorby narrativism until Alexander convinced me that you could. I though the priorities of "addressing premise" and "maintaining blorb" were incompatibly (you could only have one *highest* priority). But my new take is that you can select "address premise while maintaining fully blorb" as your *highest* priority and thus do fully blorby narrativism. And that's why I changed the phrasing <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484118/#Comment_484118" rel="nofollow">in the very second post of this thread</a> and... we've had this exact same convo a couple of times in the thread already (<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484271/#Comment_484271" rel="nofollow">here is one example</a>). Not to be ablist, I have some memory issues too.♥♥♥ <b>Edit:</b> not saying that you have memory issues or if you have that they are to blame for my poor writing and me being hard to understand

Yes, the old thread about <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21073/four-mirror-scenarios-and-two-groups/p1" rel="nofollow">four mirror scenarios and two groups</a> has the clearest explanation of blorb vs unblorb.

<p>I’m getting kinda sick of my own thesis (“Unblorb with traditional techniques is a bad idea”), I’m getting worn down by the constant disagreement even though I’m not really hearing any arguments against it…?</p><p>And I’ve tried to put forward plenty of arguments including the technique walkthrough.</p><p>And here’s another one. It’s also an analogy. Kind of a variant on <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> ’s air chess argument, which was a great argument too btw.</p><p>On a bus there are four passengers. Old W, old B, kid W, kid B.</p><p>Old W and old B are playing a chess game. They have good memories so they can keep the board in their imaginations, they don’t need a physical board. Old W says “E4”, old B says “C5” etc etc. They’re playing chess in the one, true way.</p><p>Kid W and kid B thinks this “memory chess” sounds cool. They think it sounds smart &amp; clever and they want in. They don’t know anything about chess nor do they have particularly good memories. But that doesn’t bother them, they have understood the basic rule: you say a letter, then a number. Occasionally you say some more letters or numbers.</p><p>“E5” kid W starts. “K9” kid B replies. They’re playing memory chess! “E29” kid W goes on. They’re playing chess in the bad, wrong, and fun way.</p><p>In the analogy, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)" rel="nofollow">algebraic notation</a> is the “traditional techniques”, the GM player separation. The “real” (except not physically real) chess board in the oldies’ game, and the adherence to it, is blorb. The completely made up moves in the kids’ game is unblorb.</p><p>Not only does the traditional technique set up the wrong expectation, it’s also kind of the wrong task for the job. The kids are… playing that they are playing chess…?</p><p>Obv you’d get into even <em>more</em> complex nuances of this analogy if you’d have the winners of each of the two chess games face of against each other. One person tries to play chess, the other just goofing around because it’s all just a make-believe game anyway. “We’re both just playing pretend, right?”</p><p>I don’t know, I’m getting sick of the topic, of my own idea. It nestled itself in there like a vancian spell that day I found that magic mirror in the “mirror story”.</p> </div>

                            I think the chess analogy is great! <br/><br/>One important part is that the creative goals of those two chess games are entirely different. The old couple are playing proper chess. The kids are playing a fun "pretending to play chess" game, but, realistically, there's something else they're getting out of it, or they'll get bored of it pretty fast (maybe they're trying to make their numbers and letter rhyme or something).<br/><br/>Switch partners and they're both screwed!<br/><br/>I still think the most useful way to proceed is to lean on actual play, or, failing that, made-up actual play examples. How does not committing to full blorb ruin our hypothetical traditional-technique Narrativist game?<br/><br/>Your walkthrough was... interesting, but it doesn't in any way address what Deliverator was saying: in your mental model of various roleplaying types, you've omitted a fourth option, which is what we're talking about. That type wasn't included in the walkthrough, and, unfortunately, it's what we're trying to discuss.<br/><br/>I do think it's entirely possible that you've never experienced that type of play, as one possible explanation (that kind of thing is entirely possible in a lot of these discussions!).<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            I think <i>Burning Wheel</i> is far closer to a blorb game than a hippie game, by your criteria (and most people's). If you make it less "traditional", that will make it less appealing to a lot of the game's fans.<br/><br/>You're right that it asks you to "switch stances" sometimes, in limited and circumscribed areas. So do PbtA games.<br/><br/>Some people are bothered by this. Some people aren't bothered by it at all - they love it! Still others are a bit bothered, but they accept it because they like the effects on play, and that's a worthwhile tradeoff for them.                        </div>

                            Hello,<br/><br/>I just had an epiphany while reading <a href="/forums/profile/moconnor%27s">@moconnor's</a> description of Klockwerk in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22118/half-myth-why-burning-wheel-is-a-no-myth-game" rel="nofollow">"Half-myth" (why Burning Wheel is a no myth game)</a> thread.<br/><br/>This is no way meant to disparage or in any way cast shadows on Sandra's game style but I think what she's attempting to create is the <i>anti-Turing <del>Machine</del> Test</i> experience.  Rather than programming a computer to converse with people for the purpose of trying to convince the user that he/she is talking to a human Sandra seems to trying to a human using blorb/glorical/Klockwerk trying to convince humans at the table that she's "not there."  Or to be more specific not exercising her human agency.  If she isn't "there" then what the players are experiencing must be the result of a "real" alternate reality.<br/><br/>I'm neither endorsing or not endorsing this as effective, but it certainly ties a lot of the disparate pieces together in my (rather simple) mind.<br/><br/>Just a thought.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>Edit - changed "Machine" to "Test" because I'm an idiot and Sandra corrected me because she's cool like that!                        </div>

When inspiration strikes, when I happen to read a suitable adventure or city description, when something seems relevant for player character background, or when the players seem to be on the way somewhere.<br/><br/>Railroaded modules are scrubbed clear of rails - preset events turned into random ones, mostly, and random encounter tables need to be added. Once triggered (players interact or choose to not interact with a location), it starts living its own life, which breaks the railroads quite effectively and creates new content for play, too.
<blockquote><br/>How does it work with, say, a science fiction genres, as opposed to fantasy genre, where you're dealing with the issue on a multi-planet, planet-wide scale?<br/></blockquote>
You ask the players what they are planning to do and prep based on that. Have good random tables or develop them in play. It would be more challenging, but I do believe there is a fair amount of pre-written scifi content already available. If you go for more fantastic scifi, then there is Star wars and Starfinder (scifi Pathfinder); with harder scifi, there might be stuff for Traveller and probably some Star frontiers things would also work. Then there are all possible movies and computer games - Starcraft campaign scenarios would give fine pieces of overland maps, for example. Some locations/space ships in Alien movies could be used.
<blockquote><br/>How do you avoid playing into your players' interests in the name of a consistent world?<br/></blockquote>
By using random tables, thinking how likely things would be and rolling dice, and by having a varied set of players.
<blockquote><br/>And, while I can see a single person committing to it as designer/GM, I just don't see how that works out well in the long-term for that person, nor do I see how it encourages anyone else to take up that same level of commitment.<br/></blockquote>
I have been running a sandbox world for several years now; sometimes with different rules systems, sometimes at cons. I have moved twice, and occasionally still run a game for the people in the city and country where I started the campaign/world.<br/><br/>Many parts of the game world are quite familiar and have layers of history.
<blockquote><br/> What do you do to confine play within an area to allow better blorbiness? I mean, at the campaign level.<br/><br/>How does it impact play if players seem intent on ignoring content and going off the map, so to speak.<br/><br/>How do you react to that? In game, out of game?<br/><br/>What kind of setting works best with blorbiness? Is there a point at which a setting is effectively mined out for your purposes?<br/><br/>At what point is it legit to re-use unexplored blorbied-up areas? Or is it really never legit, and the temptation to do so is treading on thin ice?<br/></blockquote>
Explicitly talking to the players is a good option. Another is to plop a suitable map/adventure to fill the empty place, if you know of any; and if you know of several that would be good fits, roll a die.<br/>Here, "suitable" means that it fits with what has already been established in the fiction.<br/><br/>The setting would have to be quite small and isolated to really become empty - someone will grab power, creatures will move in from elsewhere if there is unclaimed space, etc. There are neighbouring regions.<br/><br/>Of course, any given group of player characters might settle in and retire, which establishes yet another set of non-player characters that will shape the world further and can be interacted with by new characters.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>For me, the important thing is to consider the game world as a larger thing, and the given set of player characters as an incidental disruptive force that changes things and acts.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> <br/> <br/>Thanks for the post but it does leave me wondering about a couple things.<br/><br/>1) That's pretty much how I would do an Old School game too. On the other hand, my impression was that 2097 was going for something even more solid than that, with much more pre-game prep than that, which is what has been confusing me while watching this conversation.<br/><br/><br/>2) This next part is possibly a bad derail, but I'm trying to figure out how I'd make 2097's on-steroids version of pre-game prep work with either Boot Hill or Gangbusters, two of my old-timey favorite TSR games. Both of them have rather nice, simple setting modules for them, but both have larger adventure modules that I have a hard time envisioning working with anything like an explore in any direction set up, at any time. Neither one's module are quite so site-based as D&amp;D modules ( or general fantasy RP modules of the earliest styles). Since you name checked it, neither are the Star Frontiers modules really. Even the first Volturnus is only barely an example, and it starts off fairly railroad with the Taking of the Eleanor Morales.( Did I remember that name right after all these years?)                        </div>

One thing I guess I do more than Sandra, but less than Eero, is to trust my spontaneous ideas to be hygienic. I just had a nice idea that a certain assassin the player characters hurt might send a message back, probably with a poison. It would fit their nature. But then: Would they have access to such a poison? No, their equipment has been defined. Could they manufacture some kind of poison? Possibly. so I set up probabilities and roll a die.<br/><br/>The idea that they might use poison was one of these spontaneous ideas. They could just as well slipped away silently, for example, never to be heard from again. That is what another bad guy is planning to do, for example. I do not start second-guessing each such decision.

One needs to take the rails off the adventures, turn set-piece encounters into random ones, etc. I think the Volturnus adventure (I have only read them and that was some years back) had something like the players meeting some intelligent species at "dramatic" times; just turn those into random encounters. Use something like reaction rolls to determine who are friendly and who not. Turn scripted events into random ones; roll when the invaders land and start their attack, either by making it an encounter table entry or adding a separate larger scale event table, or just saying it happens in d20 months.<br/><br/>If the adventure has all the events focused on the scripted path the players take, you might want to add more content to other places on the map, too.<br/><br/>You are grabbing locations, monsters, NPC:s, and the setting from the adventure, not the plot. For some adventures it might not be worth it to do this; you would gain too little and throw away too much. In that case, find a better adventure or source to mine.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with Boot hill or Gangbusters. For a western, I would imagine that many D&amp;D villages would be fine, since they always have general stores and other western colour.<br/><br/>If Gangbusters is more urban, then you might want to find as a good a map of the city as possible. Maybe get some inspiration, or at least a review of existing technology, from Alexandrian's writing on urban adventuring: <a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/36473/roleplaying-games/thinking-about-urbancrawls" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/36473/roleplaying-games/thinking-about-urbancrawls</a> (a long series)<br/><br/>Non-player characters with lists of goals, personality and resources at hand might be the most useful kind of prep, there. The "resources at hand" is often missing from or mostly handwaved in character drama games, but if the game has a challenge dimension, then it is vital.                        </div>

                            Thanuir:<br/><br/>With Boot Hill, I could see that working, since D&amp;D has Old Western DNA. OTOH, some of them are a bit more locally focused and time-line-ish too.<br/><br/>The Gangbusters modules are mysteries* with timelines. That's where things get a bit trickier. Without those modules or something similar, PIs, Plain clothes Division Detectves, and Reporters have little to nothing to do.<br/><br/>Decent mysteries emulating  classic styles of books and film can certainly be tricky to do, especially ones with commitment to prep, so those modules are god sends.<br/><br/>*Well, okay, the modules after <b>GB1: Trouble Brewing</b>, which is a setting module (with a nice fictional city that ties to the maps in the boxed set) and a series of events meant to set up a power vacuum in the local underworld. All the stuff in the first one could easily be expanded into a decent sand box. <br/><br/><br/>[Total side note: I kinda want to create a tool called the " Wait, so why is everybody else acting all mysterious then ?!?!" Worksheet. Any given mystery is actually pretty straight forward. It's just that absolutely everyone else involved is trying to hide their own personal, possibly criminal but unrelated, dirt that they muddy everything up. Or, they try to cover for someone else they think is dirty. Whatever. Mystery writing is hard...)                        </div>

                            Hi Sandra,<br/><br/>You asked me question up thread that I promise I will get to, but I wanted to expand a little bit on the <i>anti-Turing Test</i> idea that I spitballed just above.<br/><br/>I'm reading all your pre-game prep of the world as the "Initial Conditions" used in your Turing Machine. (This time I <i>think</i> I am using the term correctly...I hope).  Your algorithms are your hard resolution mechanics and pre-generated tables of random encounters.  From there the machine idles until the players do something that the machine is programmed to recognize or a random encounter is triggered.<br/><br/>To prove to the players that you are indeed not exercising Agency you have the Social Contract stipulations about your notes being available.  You also use the Hyper Clarity process so the players can indeed see that it's "truly" the algorithms that are resolving the tasks and that you are in no way involved.  Yet that's not entirely true.  The new combat system that you created with the help of posters here to create powerful and exciting combats is an expression of your creative aesthetics about how the game should be played/experienced.  Yet for all your efforts the combat system is highly stylized and does not match the real world in the least.  Nothing wrong with that at all as no combat system replicates "reality."  Huzzah for succeeding!  But this does clash with the idea of wanting to create "reality."  What you've created does not come even close to how "real" combat works and from my perspective <i>nor should it</i>.  It is designed in a way that really, really jazzes you and your players and that rawks.  But that is not reality, that's buy in.<br/><br/>I just wanted to point out that the world "real" or "reality" just doesn't apply to a exercise that is imaginary.  What you are trying to create for your players is a strong sense of plausibility via credibility.  As long as how the game rolls comports with their sense of plausibility then the sense of real in strengthened.  But there is no real.  If the players ever truly felt that what they were experiencing in game was objectively real then they would, definitionally, be dissociating from reality - hallucinating if you will.  They would stop miming their combat actions and just start hacking at your with whatever could be pressed into service as a weapon.<br/><br/>I just found this in <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=9826.msg103439#msg103439" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> and it references game prep and Fang Langford - 
<blockquote><b>Preparation</b>: By this formulation, preparation simply amounts to one player's construction of an imaginary space which he wants to make shared.  But the only way that space becomes shared is through progressive Validations, leading to Integrations; in short, the other players must Abduce the total space.  All the preparation in the world is not play, because it doesn't create Proposals; semiotically, there are no signs, because all signs require an interpretant to be such, and since there are no signs, no Abduction can occur.  One person creating a personal language in a closet is doing something, but it's not communication.<br/><br/>This reminds me of some old threads about No Myth gamemastering.  Fang Langford emphasized this 'myth' that prepared material was already present in the game, and said that on the contrary, nothing is present in the shared space until it's, well, shared.  The semiotic model would support that conclusion: you can Explore a pre-prepared space, just as you can Explore a totally open-ended one, and either way it requires addition because it requires successive Abductions and Deductions.</blockquote>
We run into further questions about creating a "reality" that is really real when we consider just how complex the world is.  Do you model a tree falling in a forest using material sciences equations for wood?  When characters ford a strong do you use fluid dynamics equations to model the forces of the water?  Do you take into account why the tree fell?  What is merely diseased or was it dead?  Did a beaver have a hand in it or was it Wood Boring Beetles?  Perhaps it was a long drought?  Do you model weather using nonlinear mathematics?  What about flooding?  Do you model the wildlife populations and how they all interact with each other?  No.  Of course not.  Because information of this sort just isn't salient most of the time and when it is a reasonable representation is plausible enough.  But whatever that representation is it is neither accurate or 'real', just plausible enough to stand in for our conception of "reality."<br/><br/>The point is in an RPG the very idea of a "tangible really 'real' world" is really just a construct - a castle in the air, if you will.  One that you've worked very very hard to construct.  You've also made many many aesthetic choices to are really just expressions of your personal tastes.  It's all good.  The same goes with the process of play you've created.<br/><br/>My game has been described as opaque (for understandable reasons but its really a matter of CA expectation mismatch) yet you work very very hard to keep the black curtain closed with regards to your creative input.  From what I can noodle out is that you've placed your Agency at a full step removed from actual game play.  IOW you express your agency about how the game should be run (from both a designer and an aesthetic perspective) in your game pregen and the various random tables and your growing and evolving resolution mechanics.  Which, from what I've seen, are hard core Task Resolution methods which suits your Klockwerk/blorb very well.  The idea of "fairness" matched with intense reliance on Task Resolution very strongly suggests a Challenge based game.  No changing things willy-nilly here.  If the player has a sucky outcome that the way life breaks.  If the game stalls and goes nowhere for hours in real time, tough luck.  That's the way life works.<br/><br/>However, I think lots of the problems in these threads is the lack of a common vocabulary and people arguing back and forth about this game and that game without a conceptual framework is really hurting the process.  I think I'll start a thread just for that purpose but in effort to open and honest I make to claim to the actual text.  It was written by someone much smarter than I.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

That's the problem.  Memory is not the ontological "thing".  It's a representation of some external reality as run through the <i>subjective</i> filter of the person experiencing the event.  The memory of an event is not the ontological event itself.  To use an analogy it is the finger pointing to the moon, but it is not the moon itself.  Or put another way the memory is our cognitive map of the ontological reality but it is not reality itself.  All memories are subjective.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

<p>So you, Sil, bring up some interesting distinctions like they’re not <em>actually</em> gonna start hacking atcha, similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JzNt1bSk_U" rel="nofollow">Frank Lantz talk I linked to earlier</a>, when he says that if we were playing a super immersive game there would be no “game” left, we’d be in another world and we’d have to look down pick up some virtual pebbles or whatever and play chess with them.</p><p>And, OK, fair. Let’s use your definitions that it is a game, that it is made up. (For the purps of I don’t want to get into a semantics fight.

Imagine a game like Battleship or Rock-Paper-Scissors or Poker. In those games there are things in the game state that are canon, that are immutable, but that are not shared. The “myth” would have it that those games do not exist…</p><p>… if you have such a game in a roleplaying game, where there <em>is</em> a canon 5-wide, 8-high corridor going 35 feet forward until it splits in a T intersection to the left and right, and it’s dark, and there are cobwebs, and if that corridor existed even before the players heard of it, before it was “shared”….</p><p><em>then the DM and the players would be inside of the <strong>same</strong> “unreal, gamey, not-like-real-combat, not-like-reality, its-just-a-game, dream logic”</em></p><p>There is symmetry with regards to the degree of “reality” or “canonicity” that the two sides are treating the prepared material.</p><p>It’s not just the GM spinning a yarn and barfing forth apocalyptica anymore.

Because the signifier <strong>has</strong> a referent.</p><p>The “made-up” “game” has the curious and interesting property that there is a canon offscreen gamestate that the DM and the players are interacting with, through an assymmetrical interface (by design) but with a symmetrical degree of canonicity.</p><p>Joueur (Fang) and Chris Lehrich, if they still believe it’s just a myth, are like the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485112/#Comment_485112" rel="nofollow">chess-playing kids in this analogy</a>. I don’t know if they still are; it’s been 15 years since they wrote that, and back in 2004, I thought it was a myth too. Heck even in 2010 I thought it was a myth; that was before I got my own semiotics degree and could see that they didn’t know what they were talking about.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/clehrich" rel="nofollow">clehrich</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>First, the classic, never-answered question in semiotics is how you get from Sign to Referent. If by Referent you mean an actual physical thing, the answer is you don’t. But here, you actually do, because all Referents are part of an imagined space, not a physical one. Thus things (referents) are actually constructed through signification (Proposals, language, signs, etc.).</p></div></blockquote><p>This is incorrect on kind of two levels.</p><p>First of all, his limiting the word “sign” to utterances-made-at-the-table does not have support in the literature. If I write “Silmenume is a sweetheart” in my secret diary that only I can read, that is still me using signs in a semiotic sense. Chris’ language-in-a-closet quip was kinda (wilfully?) ignorant because obviously there <em>is</em> an interpretant—the Dungeon Master!</p><p>Second, regardless of which definition of “sign” is in use, the <strong>referents</strong> aren’t constructed through utterances-made-at-the-table. They are constructed, or integrated, at prep time (or, worst case, at the third truth tier). That’s why I have such a hangup with injection of entities into the diegesis—<em>because they are referents in the semiotic model</em>.</p> </div>

He meant hard "memory" in the figurative sense; records. In other words: notes, not neurons.<br/><br/>Since the referent is diegetical, the record is the ontology.<br/> </div>

                            Hard memory is not really subjective. If I write in my prep "3 Ogres" or "Kobayashi deals in corporate bounds with a biker gang" that's that. Oh sure, that needs an interpreter. But that doesn't mean I can interpret it as 4 goblins or Kobayashi being clean. It's not THAT kind of subjective.                        </div>

                            I like where this is going, and I totally understand the "kind of realness" Sandra and DeReel are describing here. I think that's valid and a real thing to talk about.<br/><br/>However, I feel - and have felt all along - that <i>pretending something which isn't real is tangible</i> is a vital part of roleplaying, and a big part of what makes "klockwerk" tick. Yes.<br/><br/>But... claiming that a game with a prepped dungeon is somehow fundamentally "more real" than one without is self-delusion, in my opinion. <br/><br/>To lose sight of the fact that we're all sitting around at a table making stuff up seems... completely dishonest, in my opinion.<br/><br/>When you tell your friend to get some "angel wings and heaven pie", of course she can't do that, because she's in an actual, physical store and there is no "heaven pie" there. In an RPG, you can always say that, yes, there is heaven pie, and from now the game state has changed: to ignore that we can (and do!) constantly "change the contents of the store" is a huge oversight.<br/><br/>If that wasn't the case, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485271/#Comment_485271" rel="nofollow">errors and misunderstandings</a> couldn't happen. That would be impossible!<br/><br/>Sure, at Sandra's table we all buy into a collective delusion that there is something real we're interacting with, and she does her best to maintain that through her prep, principles, and resolution techniques, but it's still a - constructive and fun, sure! but a - delusion.<br/><br/>It's easy to prove, because if anyone ever screws up and misreports something, that supposedly "real thing" is instantly transformed. In the real grocery store, there's no chance of coming home with some "angel wings". In this kind of game, all it takes is for the friend to say, "sure, I'll get you some angel wings" and bam! the grocery now has angel wings and (even more importantly) <i>has had angel wings all along</i>.<br/><br/>In short, I don't think any amount of discussion about how 'real' something like this might feel discredits with Silmenume and Chris Lehrich and Le Joueur are saying about the idea of "Myth". To claim otherwise is extremely dishonest.                        </div>

Chris made some errors in his argument, I pointed out two of them [I figured I’d start there] and the most relevant one to our research is when he said that the referents were constructed at the “proposal”/utterance level. (I’m using the construct at-the-table-utterance to not reinforce his misuse of “sign”; “at-the-table-utterances” are a subset of signs that consist of things being shared between players, such as “OK, you see a 5 feet wide corridor, what do you do?”.) <strong><em>This is demonstrably a false statement.</em></strong></p><p>A cornercase of our position is that these referents are constructed when they are injected, as entities, into the diegesis <em>at prep time</em> rather than, as Chris and Fang says, being constructed only later, when they are shared between participants.</p><p>Going from that statement to “Sandra is delusional” or “Sandra is extremely dishonest” is frankly rude.</p><p>Let me bring it back to the “there is now heaven pie” example.</p><p>In AW the rule is that you add the one die to the other die and then add in your stat and that is the sum that you are comparing to the 7–9 or whatever. Someone <em>could</em> say I’m gonna also add in the number of toes I have on the left foot to that sum. But they would be breaking a rule of the game. Producing the number you use to compare to the 7–9 or whatever is governed by a rule of the game.</p><p>In full blorb, injecting entities (“heaven pie”) into the diegesis is similarly governed by rules of the game.</p> </div>

                            (Yeah, and that's a problem for me. It may help to understand, perhaps, that the sort of transformative "breakthrough" you experienced by discovering "blorby" play - finally finding the "good stuff" in gaming! - came for me by encountering and understanding the Lumpley Principle. After all, I <i>had started out the whole business of gaming</i> from the basis of "blorb" or "klockwerk" and a "real game-state", and had a pretty miserable time. So the idea that sticking to "klockwerk" techniques will improve and fix gaming is a hard one for me to take seriously, since that's where I started in the first place.)<br/><br/>(More theoretically, I'm not sure how you can even maintain a coherent real-world understanding of what happens at the game table without the Lumpley Principle - it's like the concept of evolution by natural selection when it comes to biology, or gravity or the Three Laws of Motion for Newtonian physics, etc; it's pretty fundamental.)                        </div>

                            I think you really just need a very small revision to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Lumpley</span> Baker-Care-Boss Principle:<br/><br/>From: "System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play."<br/><br/>To: "System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events <b>and gamestate changes</b> during play."<br/><br/>Just, recognizing that there are things that matter outside the imagined events.

                            Ok, to recap: You've got a dungeon. In the prep, we've written two things:<br/><br/>1. "Vorpal sword in room A."<br/>2. "Every 10 minutes of exploration, roll a d%. On a 99-100, a green dragon approaches."<br/><br/>Baker-Care-Boss Principle-wise, the group's obviously agreed that when we roll a green dragon, that bad brother gets injected into imagined events and if need be the gamestate, yeehaw! <br/><br/>Are you also asking whether the presence of the encounter table in the prep implies that there's a green dragon in the gamestate, before we ever roll?<br/><br/>Depends on the rules.<br/><br/>In other words, depends on whether this group has agreed that every entity on an encounter table is in the gamestate but not yet in the imagined events...<br/><br/>Or whether they've agreed that entities on an encounter table are mere potential, and they get added to the gamestate and imagined events simultaneously when they're rolled.<br/><br/>In practice I think most groups use something of a mix. For the tables I'm working on right now, the convention will be: named or unique entities are in the gamestate, generic entities get added to the state only when they're rolled.                        </div>

                            From the standpoint of the PCs, I think offscreen prep corresponds to what Deleuze calls "the virtual" (in the sense of the possible though not manifest).  I do <i>not</i> suggest that we use this term, since its two meanings already cause a lot of confusion in other circles, but it does bring to light another distinction that needs made:<br/><br/>In <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> 's example there is a clear difference between (A) the prepped/placed sword and (B) the fact that according to the wandering monster table, even before the GM has rolled the dice, the dragon might exist.  Both of these things are "virtual" in Deleuze's sense, but just before the PCs enter the room the sword is only virtual <i>to them</i> (to the GM it is already in the "gamestate"), while in example B the dragon is virtual to everyone at the table.  This difference is not just a matter of a flipped bit: these two types of objects have completely different lines of ingress and means of state change.<br/><br/>So yeah, the various levels of ontology and virtuality present in a game will need words if they are to be discussed, but low-res/abstract terms like "real" will not be up to the task, and this is exactly why philosophers are always inventing their own nuanced words and use cases for them.  I'm fine with "gamestate" but I don't think it will carry us the whole way.<br/><br/>At a certain point we will need to begin speaking of "orders" or "levels" of nested or hierarchically-relative ontologies, and of virtualities (in the sense of potential events) relative to different players, functional roles ("GM," "Player," even "Player with a Drama Token," etc), as well as to playstyles, rulesets, situations, and maybe even genres.  These are all assemblages of different types.  Some are encapsulated within others, and even this encapsulation differs depending on game rules and playstyle.<br/><br/>It would be a huge mistake to think that a single ontological model could encompass all possible states of all possible objects and potentialities in all possible rulesets that all humans might consider an "RPG" without sacrificing the majority of useful detail to abstraction, leaving us back in the "cloud."                        </div>

<p>Paul, re your uneasiness because of your previous bad experiences with this concept, I think you’re right that there are some other missing pieces. A porte-monstre-trésor array, some saliency time zooming, more dramatic [rather than zany] PCs, rules to generate/reward that drama.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I think you really just need a very small revision to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Lumpley</span> Baker-Care-Boss Principle:</p><p>From: “System (including but not limited to ‘the rules’) is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play.”</p><p>To: “System (including but not limited to ‘the rules’) is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events <b>and gamestate changes</b> during play.”</p>Just, recognizing that there are things that matter outside the imagined events. Chess boards for the cat to knock over. Because the chessboard / gamestate is licensed by the social contract every bit as much as the shared imagined space.</div></blockquote><p>So, and my reasoning for the following <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485392/#Comment_485392" rel="nofollow">can be found here</a>, I want to move away from focusing on the “<strong>shared</strong> imagined space” and instead incorporating the offscreen gamestate into our model of the diegesis as a whole. In our model, unshared facts can be canon.</p><p>In our model, Kanadius [an NPC from B4 The Lost City] is an entity that can be part of the diegesis even without anyone in our own group knowing that he exists. (Just like The Show is part of the diegesis for the Moneyball movie even while the DVD is still in it’s shrink wrapper and we haven’t seen it yet.)</p><p>Because during prep sometimes you go “OK, this module goes here, this one goes here” and maybe you don’t read them that carefully because you’re not sure the PCs are gonna go there. In a semiotic analysis of our model, that exact moment is when the referent is constructed, when you say “OK the Lost City goes in this hex”. I’ll drop the semiotics talk btw, sorry for nerding it up yesterday; it was sort of a direct reply to… uh… some posts from 15 years ago♥</p><p>The fact that Kanadius is the Grand Master of the Brotherhood of Gorm, that fact is also an entity that’s part of the diegesis in the same manner.</p><p>In our model, the rules do cover injecting entities into the diegesis even when that action isn’t “shared”.</p><p>Now, for my own game, that “rule” isn’t particularly systemic, the rule is I can do pretty much whatever I want in terms of <em>adding</em> tier 1 and tier 2 ‘truth’ entities between sessions (and that it’s better to do it between campaigns than between sessions but that’s also a very difficult limitation creating a lot of upfront work. Which <a href="/forums/profile/Jon">@Jon</a> and friend managed to pull off otoh. One day…) whereas <em>changing</em> things would be more controversal. The tier 3 layer is a last-resort safety-net. “Oops I guess that chest was empty [note to self, make rules to disclaim decision-making for chest contents].” (Btw, this is kind of a side observation but the tier three fallback <em>sometimes also creates new rules</em>; “I don’t know how much magically active moss you can find in a day in the forest, let me make some rules for finding that out.”)</p><p>When I first started wrestling with this new model, from OSR games, I was like “Oooh, the dungeon-generation and the dungeon-stocking algorithms are key”. I wanted to solve <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22113/when-i-was-lost-and-cried-out-for-blorb-and-couldnt-find-blorb/p1" rel="nofollow">the chasm width problem</a>.</p><p>No, while they are really good tools for producing a well made porte-monstre-trésor array, following them strictly isn’t necessary; it turns out “No Paper before seeing Rock” is enough to solve the chasm width problem. The rules for <em>what</em> you introduce can be kinda generous/sloppy towards the DM, as long as you’re careful about <em>when</em> you introduce things. Those algorithms are useful because you want a good match of goals to problems (“gold” to “monsters”), and they can help you find that sorta self-balancingness that D&amp;D can have when the players can sorta decide on their own which areas they are ready for and which areas they are not strong enough for yet. But while “No Paper before seeing Rock” is an appropriate rule for OSR-style prep; it’s not sufficient for something like an on-model take on <abbr title="Burning Wheel">BW</abbr>-like game where you’d want to have a rule or system that injects entities into the diegesis that are especially appropriate for the protagonized <abbr title="Beliefs in the BW-specific sense, that is">Beliefs</abbr>.</p><p>What we do in actual practice in our D&amp;D game [so not sure how prescriptive this particular example should be] is that we can inject entities into the diegesis when we are in character creation mode. “Oh, you rolled up that you had a rival from theatre school? I’ll place her in town X and also on encounter tables Y and Z.” Now, yes, I <em>had</em> seen Rock while choosing that Paper. So apparently the “No Paper before seeing Rock” principle isn’t the be-all, end-all solution and we need to find a better rule to replace it. (These entities have so far been a very tiny fraction of the sum of all canonical entites in the diegesis.)</p> </div>

                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a>,<br/><br/>If understand what is being proposed about "gamestate" is that it includes information/facts that have not yet been <i>shared</i> and thus lies utterly outside the purview of the Lumpley Principle (BCB).  If my understanding of "gamestate" is incorrect then, of course, my argument holds no relevance.<br/><br/>The very foundation of role-play as defined by Exploration (Sharing Imaginings among players - Setting, Situation, Character, Color and Setting) is the actual communication among the players.<br/><br/>This as lifted from <a href="http://big-model.info/wiki/Lumpley_Principle" rel="nofollow">The Big Model Wiki</a> re: the Lumpley Principle -
<blockquote>You can point to the pages of your book all you want to. You can imagine stuff in your head all you want to.<br/><br/>The fact is that <b>nothing happens, in the fiction of role-playing, unless someone says it and it's heard by others</b>. Even if the book says, "On a critical hit, you do double damage," your character won't actually do double damage on a critical hit unless someone recognizes it and says it.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>"System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which <b>the group agrees to imagined events during play.</b>" ...</blockquote>
I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a> that the part of the game that exists outside the SIS has not been well discussed and the need for some specific vocabulary to help that discussion along is important.<br/><br/>However, what it is absolutely fundamental to role-play is that you have human beings communicating (by whatever method) with each other.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>Edit - cross posted with Sandra so this post does not touch upon anything in her post.                        </div>

                            I think your discussion of "No Paper before seeing Rock" is exactly on the ball. It's absolutely key to blorby/klockwerk play - the whole concept of disciplined prep. (And it's also freeing to realize that this means you can make all kinds of stuff up on the spot, so long as it precedes the players' choice - the proverbial "Rock". Maintaining that hygiene is much easier if you do it well in advance, but it's not impossible - for instance, not knowing what the players are thinking of doing is often sufficient for a "on the spot" invention to be entirely hygienic.)

This is exactly correct, and the root of the problem with this particular thread:<br/><br/>In Narrativist play, we generally/usually *want* to choose Paper after seeing Rock. Making those choices - what will I do with that rival from theatre school so as to make life interesting for the PC? - is at the heart of play.<br/><br/>There are all the same issues of saliency and Paper-before-Rock, but they occur in very different places and in very different ways. (Now, our hygiene is all about taking our hands off the PCs' choices and the resolution of in-game conflicts, instead of porte-monstre-tresor.*)<br/><br/><br/>*: If you look at AW's rules, you'll find all kinds of ways that they force the MC(GM) to take their hands off these decision points, from the way you can't change the "difficulty" of making moves to "all NPCs have the same number of hit points" to "under these conditions, this move gets triggered" to "this is how hunger works in the hardhold" to "say what honesty demands/what your prep demands" and so on and so on. It's much more subtle than in earlier Narrativist designs, but it's enough to have a strong effect on gameplay.                        </div>

I was hoping my italicized text at the bottom of my post would be enough to address this, but apparently it wasn't. I'll clarify again:<br/><br/>Imagine, for the sake of the example, that we're dealing with a general-purpose, large-scale random table collection, like a "Blorbella's Tome of Random Encounter Charts for All Occasions, volume 17" - one of those thick tomes with 100 random encounters or monsters per page.<br/><br/>Maybe the GM's procedure is to open the book to a random page and then roll a d100.                        </div>

That's not a <b>problem</b> with the thread, instead, it's why the thread is <b>valuable</b>. There is obviously unclear/unfinished design work in this area and the "No Paper after seeing Rock" [whoops I see that I wrote "before" in some places] principle is more of a rough guideline; we want to create a way to think about <i>rules</i> in this space.                        </div>

The mistake correction process has also revelatory for how applicable our new model is;<br/>since often mismatches from what's been said, compared to what's in the prep, <b>have been corrected</b> even though when looking only at the subset of the diegesis that had been shared at the table, that subset would've been consistent if the mistake had been left to stand. In other words: prep is canon.<br/> </div>

                            I think the gamestate being known to some is also a good way to identify rewards (being the only one-s to know) and enables to categorize "information divulgation" techniques, like in, say, detective or horror stories.                        </div>

There are games built on the model that entities are injected into the diegesis only as they are uttered. The Baker/Care-Boss principle does apply to those games.<br/><br/>We want to have another model that enables other games.<br/><br/>The principle "Magic cards have relevant text only on the front side of the cards" was true for 18 years... and then the Innistrad expansion came out with text and art printed on the back of cards too.<br/><br/>Design space can grow when principles change.                        </div>

                            I understand that. From where I'm sitting, this is more like saying, "Hey, what if we ignored those Innistrad cards, and make it a new rule that 'relevant text can only be on the front side of the cards', and see what we can make with that?"<br/><br/>It's going backwards, in order of the development of those ideas. (This idea of the gamestate, although not in those words, of course, is how everyone I knew approached gaming back in the early 90's, and is strongly implied by the earliest D&amp;D texts.)<br/><br/>However, I'm ready to keep an open mind, because I'm *super excited* about any possibility of the design space growing, as you say. I'm just saying: be smart and careful and be aware that some very smart and knowledgeable people have torn down this approach before. You'll have to have bulletproof arguments or some really cool proof-of-concept designs! (Sometimes even incorrect ideas/theories can give birth to some great stuff, after all.)<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the point - I don't want this to become a digression from the actual topic.                        </div>

Because we don't have enough experience with, vocab for, rules around, and a model for the type of activities we are doing in "character creation &amp; dungeon prepping" mode as opposed to the "in play" mode which, through these last years of developing the various pillars &amp; principles &amp; glossaries, has become very refined.<br/><br/>Hence thread                        </div>

Exactly. Preparing content is just <i>one</i> way to help a GM maintain neutrality.

I fully agree. <br/><br/>In a lot of gamist play, we want to make interesting choices (in a particular arena -- combat only in my last D&amp;D 4e campaign, just about everything in most "sandbox" campaigns -- I think that's one way to interpret the term) and then <b>have them judged fairly</b> (typically in terms of success-failure), e.g. by a transparent process (e.g. the application of the combat rules without fudging).<br/><br/>Other options than transparency exist, e.g. trust in the GM, though such trust may have to be earned, particularly with the looming spectre of illusionism. For instance, trust may be built by a campaign accruing TPKs, easy wins, anticlimaxes etc. A multi-pronged approach (transparency, accumulating trust, hygienic principles etc.) is probably best.<br/><br/>In narrativist play, we want to make interesting choices and <b>thereby judge the fiction ourselves</b> (i.e., address premise). In many narrativist designs, it is largely irrelevant* how the situations offering these choices come about (similar to how in my above-mentioned 4e campaign the players did not care much how the PCs got involved in the GM's next set-piece combat -- the GM had to be a neutral referee only once we rolled for initiative).<br/><br/>*Not irrelevant, really. I'm trying to express that the GM/player setting up a situation has a lot of leeway improvising it specifically to bring about those sought-after hard choices, tailoring them to the PCs and their recent decisions, current state etc..                        </div>

Trust but verify. For example, trust falls is a good trust exercise because you know that your trust paid off because the other person catched you. (Same goes for the "knife sleep" trust exercise in one of my fave novels, Kallocain.)<br/><br/>"Trust that I gave you the water glass I hadn't spat in" is a bad trust exercise because that's just gonna grow paranoia over time, not grow trust.                        </div>

                            So you clearly use <i>diegesis</i> in this sense : "c'est l'univers d'une œuvre, le monde qu'elle évoque et dont elle représente une partie." (wikipedia ; tr : "It's the universe of a novel, the world it evokes and of which the novel represents only a part.") Diegesis can be more or less subjective but is always an interpretation. <br/><br/>The term "game state" is a bit different, because it goes with the means to track it (preparation notes and drawings, character sheets and play notes, counters, etc.) The "game state" is objective. It does not describe all there is in a game though, far from it. It doesn't take into account body language at the table, for instance. It goes without saying but I'd rather say it, so you don't build a model of roleplaying where literacy has supremacy.                        </div>

                            Yeah, that’s an important distinction to make.<br/><br/>It seems to me that canon/setting information plays a big role in that, as well (like “we’re playing in Middle Earth” or “moral/spiritual alignments are a real thing in this world).                        </div>

I was hoping my italicized text at the bottom of my post would be enough to address this, but apparently it wasn't. I'll clarify again:<br/><br/>Imagine, for the sake of the example, that we're dealing with a general-purpose, large-scale random table collection, like a "Blorbella's Tome of Random Encounter Charts for All Occasions, volume 17" - one of those thick tomes with 100 random encounters or monsters per page.<br/><br/>Maybe the GM's procedure is to open the book to a random page and then roll a d100.</div></blockquote>
Oh, I don't think this actually changes my answer, really.<br/><br/>Though I have a hard time imagining a group using Blorbella's Vol. 17 going with the "everything on the encounter table is in the diegesis" option over the "things on the encounter table get injected into the diegesis when rolled" option.                        </div>

                            With our current crude tools [hence thread: we want to get some more design done in this space!!!] then yes. I guess in my practice there's a mix.

                            Sure. For that group, entries on encounter tables are clearly not yet diegetic.<br/><br/>But a lot of the time, you'll see an encounter table like this (from a game I'm prepping):
<blockquote class="Quote">
<ol>
<li><b>Mother Hen:</b> A giant, talking, flying chicken with extremely soft, downy feathers. She is always willing to provide safety and fly someone home, if they are lost or in distress—unless she is sitting an egg (25% chance). She lays giant eggs that hatch normal-sized chickens, albeit incredibly clever ones. Eating the golden yolks cures poisons and diseases, removes afflictions and curses, and can even revive the recently deceased. As a Roc with mental abilities of 16. She gives her reddish speckled feathers to her friends; they are Common one-use items that can be used to call her. She'll come along quick as she can, if not sitting an egg, arriving in (d4) minutes, tens of minutes, hours, or days. The feathers don't work for anyone but the one she gives them to.</li>
<li><b>Les Trois Sourisquetaires:</b> The mice, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, who are considered by many (and certainly by themselves) to be the greatest adventurers of the age. They are just talking mice; no particular combat ability, but they always want to prove themselves the cleverest and bravest. They are quick to take insult, issue challenge, and strike up a rivalry, and profuse with stories of their own exploits. Each 1HD.</li>
<li><b>Collector:</b> A forty-foot-tall brass and ceramic stick-man who strides across the world on stilt-legs, plucking up things and placing them in the bird-cages that dangle from his body. He is intelligent, and many things interest him; he will often stop to listen or contemplate. But he never responds; merely swats things away and strides off if annoyed. Swarms of easily-angered wasps live in several of his cages. (As an Iron Golem with d4+1 insect swarms. Instead of poison breath, when he hits with a Slam, may forego dealing damage to snatch a Medium or smaller creature up and place it in a cage. Base speed is 60 feet. Disengage as bonus action. Int 14. Gargantuan size.)</li>
<li><b>Red dragons</b>, out hunting; lair located in the nearest mountains, possibly quite distant. Equal chance of Wyrmling, Young, Adult, or Ancient. Wyrmlings will be a clutch of 1d4; young adults and ancient are solitary; adults have a 50% chance of being in a mated pair. If followed back to its mountain lair, a wyrmling's hoard is worth 1d6 x 100 GP; each age category is x10. Plus 50% chance of a magic item: uncommon for wyrmling, rare for young adult, very rare for adult, and legendary for ancient.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
Here, it's clearly a mix.<br/><br/>The existence of Mother Hen, the Mouseketeers, and Collector as individuals are part of the game state and diegetic, but not yet shared.<br/><br/>The red dragons are more complicated. The potential for red dragons is in the rules (we've agreed on this procedure that can result in red dragons appearing in the game state and imagined events). I'd probably say it's also in the game state: the potential, that is, not the dragons themselves. Are rules-in-the-textual-sense (as opposed to Baker-Care-Boss Principle rules) that we've agreed to use per the B-C-B Principle part of the game state, idunno?<br/><br/>I'm unclear about whether or not the potential for red dragons is in the diegesis. I think yes: per this particular game's convention, a generic entry on an encounter table means that at least one entity of that type exists.<br/><br/>It's very much not yet shared, that's sure. The game hasn't even started. Only one of the future players knows it even exists. (And yet, it has some state and diegesis already!)<br/><br/>The hoard of indeterminate size and possible magic items possessed by possible red dragons, I think, are firmly in the same category as the entries in the roll tables in Blorbella's Vol. 17.                         </div>

                            Quite right. A random encounter table can be “this thing exists; when do we encounter it?” and it can be “what is in that room?”, and gradations in between.<br/><br/>The point of all this is that it’s not as simple as “improvised = it wasn’t there in the first place” and “generated by random table or procedure = it was always part of the game state”. The way gaming works isn’t that simple.<br/><br/>And there’s ALWAYS room for, “hey we rolled this encounter/this is what the module says now, but that makes no logical sense and breaks our sense of what’s happening in the game, so we can’t accept it”, which is the Lumpley Principle in action.                        </div>

                            Hello,<br/><br/>The problem with using the literate/textural mode of diegesis WRT to RPGs is that the totality of the text has yet to be written.  For the diegesis to exist the text has to be read by a human being.<br/><br/>What I'm picking up so far, but to my very poor memory, has not been made explicit is that what is being described as canon is being used in two different ways WRT to RPGs.<br/><br/>1.  You have the preparations made by the GM which are claimed to canon.  The information contained within said canon is not available to the players at this state.  I'm just avering that it is only the GM who has knowledge of the contents of the canon.<br/><br/>2.  You have the canon of the SIS.  This is the record of what <i>actually happened</i> as a result of play.  This canon is shared and known by all the players including the GM.  This can only happen via a communication process amongst the players, which includes the GM whereby all the players agree via consensus that of all the events proposed only those agreed upon actually have credibility.  The Lumpley (BCB) Principle in action.<br/><br/>The sticking point of calling type 1 canon is that no one but the GM knows about it.  I'm getting the sense that the end run around that issue is that via Social Contract Agreement the players can <i>read</i> the canon (the text) post hoc, e.g. after the act of Exploration (in theory terms) has come to a conclusion because it never ran through the Lumpley Principle.<br/><br/>One way to address this, which is nothing new to theory, is consider that each player has their own imaginary space while the table has the Shared Imaginary Space.  Even with this formulation one has problem that the when the Game State has yet to have any presence upon the Fact Space (the SIS).<br/><br/>Let's go back to the chess game analogy.  The chess board represents the SIS.  The pieces the various PC's and monsters.  The rules of play represent the System/resolution mechanics.  They not only inform what each piece can do, what moves are illegal and how to resolve combat.  So this chessboard with the pieces and where they currently are situation represent the current state of the SIS through time.  The referee/judge would be the Lumpley (BCB) Principle.  Victory or loss (this standing in for the abstracts that are so important in roleplay) is only informed by the pieces and how they are arranged on the board.<br/><br/>But lo!  There is much more going on in the head of the chess players than in represented on the chessboard.  What the chessboard is utterly agnostic about is the significance of the positioning of the pieces.  Nor does the chessboard concern itself with the intentions of the players i.e., what they are planning on doing next.  The only thing the chessboard is about is where the pieces are right now.  It's the players that glean meaning and significance from what on the board.  Yet the players aren't solely concerned about what's on the board.  One might be concerned that their position is untenable and fight to a quick draw to conserve mental stamina for the next match.  Maybe the winning player knows that the losing player has a real problem with noise so chomps and snaps gum.<br/><br/>But more the point about game-state the losing player may have studied every game the winning player has played and know his weaknesses.  The losing player know this information well enough to bring it into play and defeat the winning player.  But unless the losing player puts his knowledge and plan into action it does not matter to the game-state.  That knowledge of how to win this match was not put into action and thus had no effect on the game-state.<br/><br/>IOW what was privately know but not publicly shared via the chessboard (the SIS) had no effect on the game-state abstraction of win or lose in the players', referees' or spectators' minds.<br/><br/>I understand that this but an analogy with all the shortcomings inherent therein.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

That’s the rule…!</p><p>Again, Baker/Care-Boss principle is kind of orthogonal to the issue of mistake handling, and in this case there’s been a rules mistake.</p><p>In a Baker/Care-Boss principle game [“a game where entities become diegetically canon only when shared”] there can be mistakes, and you can handle them in different ways.</p><p>With the Hardholder cliff fortress example I had before, saying it was on the Western side of the cliff first but then forgetting that and then saying it was on the Eastern side, you could say <em>either</em>: “Oh, hold on, wasn’t it on the Western side? I’m sorry, it’s on the Western side, let’s stick to that, that’s what we said first” <em>or</em> you could say “Oh, I just realized we’ve been saying Eastern side for a while, that makes more sense; seeing the sun rise over the barren lands, filling our vision with tiny rainbows in each of the thousand puddles of oil that dot the field.”</p><p>In a blorb game [“a game where entities can become diegetically canon even before they are being shared”] there can be mistakes, and you can handle them in different ways.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, I forgot to update the encounter table, I’ll do that later, for now please just reroll” or you could say “A red dragon? But we used an orb of snuffing? Let’s just say it stands; the red dragon opens it’s maw to unleash it’s fiery kiss of hellfire, what do you do?”</p><p>This particular rules mistake I haven’t seen done in my 5 years of running the game; using an Orb of Snuffing is such a momentous occasion. When Dr Strange used it [against vampires] in volume 2, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2362&amp;Mode=like">#62</a> that was kind of a very memorable moment. Updating the encounter table is part of it’s resolution.</p><p>However, rules mistake can <em>always</em> happen. Don’t feel bad. It happens often.</p><p>I did one yesterday when I misunderstood which direction a one-way-door went.</p> </div>

It can contain things that no-one at the table knows about. It doesn’t even have to be <em>written</em> by a human being; I can go to a random dungeon generator site, have it generate a dungeon that no human has ever read, print it out with eyes closed, go to my hex map, say this new random dungeon is in THIS hex. It now exists and everything in it is part of the, uh, diegesis, game-state, canon, blorb… <strong>even though no human on Earth has read it, said it, or shared it</strong>.<br/><br/>This “Thing” is a set of entities.<br/><br/>It’s that set of entities that we operate on while playing and running blorb games.<br/><br/>That is our relevant data structure.<br/><br/>A subset of that set is the set of entities that have been shared.<br/><br/>Keeping track of that “shared” subset is somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>As DM, there is this scepter on a throne in a room in the dungeon I’m running. The players saw it, walked up to it, but have not dared touch it. The exact amount of times they’ve seen that thing, I don’t really need to note or remember, or <em>even the fact that they’ve seen it once</em> because all I need to remember/know to do my role is that in room so-and-so there is a scepter that looks so-and-so. The predicate <code>shared-p</code> is of a kinda low relevance in the case of that scepter.<br/><br/><strong>Conversely, in a Baker/Care-Boss-principle adhering game</strong> (if such a game even exists), the relevant data structure that the participants operate upon is the set of entities that <em>have been shared</em>. When they enter room so-and-so, instead of a scepter, I can say there is a devil there, or some ice cream, or a ghost. Sure, I’d bound by the rules of the game when doing so, for example when making the “Announce Future Badness” move I can’t say “There is nice &amp; good tasting ice-cream here that restore 10 hp”.<br/><br/>Btw, I’m not even sure that Apocalypse World itself adheres to the Baker/Care-Boss-principle. “Always say what your prep demands” page 81. If I wrote down a scepter in room so-and-so, that becomes part of the relevant data structure even though it isn’t <code>shared-p</code>.

<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The sticking point of calling type 1 canon is that no one but the GM knows about it.</p></div></blockquote>This is kind of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation" rel="nofollow">equivocation fallacy</a>. You are used to reading theorists that discuss operating on a particular data-structure (the set of shared entities), the “SIS”. That makes you think that words like “canon”, “imagined space”, etc primarily denote &amp; connote qualities associated with that particular set. Leading to misconclusions like “If it’s canon, it needs to have been shared?” “If it’s diegetically coherent, it needs to have been shared?” “If it’s part of the imagined space, it needs to have been shared?” but for our new model, the relevant set that we operate on is a bigger set of entities where the <code>shared-p</code> predicate <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485392/#Comment_485392" rel="nofollow">isn’t inherently ontological but is instead of much lower relevance</a>.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>One way to address this, which is nothing new to theory, is consider that each player has their own imaginary space while the table has the Shared Imaginary Space.</p></div></blockquote>Sure, that’s true but it’s not particularly central to the way we operate when running and playing blorb games. If there is a red ball in a box, that ball doesn’t only come into existence once you open the box and look in the ball.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Even with this formulation one has problem that the when the Game State has yet to have any presence upon the Fact Space (the SIS).</p></div></blockquote>See, conflating the SIS with the Fact Space is completely wrong in the new model.<br/><br/>“Fact Space” is actually kind of a good name for the blorb, for the diegesis, for the canon, for the game-state, for the data-structure, for the “set of entities” <strong>but it absolutely is not limited to only shared things</strong>.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>There is much more going on in the head of the chess players than in represented on the chessboard. What the chessboard is utterly agnostic about is the significance of the positioning of the pieces.</p></div></blockquote>OK, so there are two kinda confusingly similar chess analogies going on here. In both analogies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation" rel="nofollow">the “chess board” is a data structure</a> that the participants are operating on.<br/><br/>In your analogy, you’re saying that the data structure relevant to you, the SIS—the set of entities that have been shared—is the chessboard, is the game-state, and that there are more things going around in the game than in that data structure and that those things might or mightn’t have an effect on that gamestate, depending.<br/><br/>But in our analogy, the “chessboard” signified a much larger set of entities. It included the prep, for example. The entire imagined space, not just the subset that is shared.<br/><br/> </div>

Since I run games for different groups, and also in cons, set in the same game world, does it mean that nothing is ever in SIS? There are very few claims about the game world that every player has met in play.<br/><br/>And these different games certainly have affected each other - an angel was summoned in a Burning wheel game quite some years ago, it has been central for a partially overlapping group of players, while a completely separate group of players has been interested but is yet to meet it.<br/><br/>Or maybe you would like to say that all of these are different games. If so, how come that actions in one of them can affect the other in a highly meaningful way? One group fights against an army and at least stalls its progress, so others do not have to worry about it. Had the first group not done that, the war would have hit the others, forcing them to react. Right now they have been doing unrelated things.<br/><br/>"Things are true when everyone knows about them." seems to be an inadequate model, here.                        </div>

Note that this misstates the Baker-Boss Principle, which is simply, "System is how we agree on what enters the fiction." We can agree that something "enters the fiction" only when it makes a difference in play (No Myth style) or we can agree that the GM's notes are "diegetic" in the sense of having a fictional existence before being communicated to any player.<br/><br/>What it means when a GM or player makes a mistake in terms of (a) contradicting what has gone before in the fiction (that is, both imagined and shared), versus (b) contradicting what has been written in their own or someone else's notes (imagined but not shared) are thus slightly different cases. In what have been calling a No Myth game, only case (a) is a problem that requires repair. In any game in which the GM's prep or the PC's secret backstory have special "ontological" status (that is, diegetic consequence), case (b) also requires repair in play.                        </div>

Just for the record♥

                            It looks like the disagreement comes from whether you see "the fiction" (in BCB Principle) as describing the "shared imaginary space" or "the game state."<br/><br/>If we assume that "the fiction" refers to the "shared imaginary space" (i.e., the narration of the game world that you and all the players know and agree on), then it seems to me that the principle is still entirely consistent with good klockwerk play.<br/><br/>Here is how that interpretation looks:<br/><br/>The BCB Principle is "system is how we agree on what enters the fiction."<br/><br/>In this game, the <b>system</b> is rules like "The fiction consists of the game state as described vividly from the perspective of the player characters" and "The DM must obey the Three Layers of Truth rule when editing the game state."<br/><br/>And the <b>game state</b> is "this dungeon module I downloaded and printed without reading."<br/><br/>Breakdown of the game at the level of the game state would look like the errors that have been discussed (e.g., the DM reads "Green Goblin" instead of "Green Dragon").  These are handled robustly by the part of the system that says something like, "If we discover an inconsistency between the fiction and the game state, we must correct it to bring them back into sync, usually by rewinding or amending the fiction."<br/><br/>On the other hand, breakdown of the game at the level of the system would look like this:<br/><br/>DM: You go into the room and see a race car.<br/><br/>Players: What?  That's ridiculous!  There's no race cars in D&amp;D!<br/><br/>DM: It's what's in the room.  We all agreed that the fiction would consist of exploring the game state, and we all agreed that the game state would include this module I downloaded and printed without reading."<br/><br/>Players: Well, we didn't know it had a race car when we agreed to it!  Come on!  We won't play unless you take out the race car.<br/><br/>The BCB principle is saying that this latter scenario is still possible, even with a system that implies the race car is part of the game.<br/><br/>Edit: OK, I see a similar clarification was reached in the other thread.  This is confusing how the discussion keeps jumping back and forth.                        </div>

                            Vivificient has the basic gist of my issues with this idea.<br/><br/>You’re so committed to the idea of prepped information being “real” that you want to twist around the theory to preserve that idea.<br/><br/>You’re taking the Principle far too literally, in other words.<br/><br/>In Lumpley Principle terms, the social agreement in a “full blorb” game is that the GM will make things up, yes, but commits to never contradicting prepped facts. This is entirely in line with the Principle, not a contradiction of it. (Just like Apocalypse World’s “say what your prep demands”.)<br/><br/>You posted an example earlier where you described there being tar on the wall, and you’re worried that the players might take advantage of that fact.<br/><br/>It sounds like, in your ideal RPG, either a) the GM is not allowed to describe tar (because it’s not prepped beforehand), or b) the players are not allowed to use that to their advantage.<br/><br/>That, in my opinion, would be a pretty terrible<br/>game, and possibly not even really a roleplaying game (something I’m usually very hesitant to say about anything that happens in the wild variety of our hobby!).<br/><br/>There are much better, easier, and more useful ways to understand the same constraints, in my opinion, or at least ways that won’t confuse people to death with statements like “my game doesn’t comply with the BCB Principle”. Therein lies madness!<br/><br/>However, it also feels like we’re butting heads with no or little progress, so I’ll just register my disagreement and then back away from this debate.<br/><br/>I may disagree with how you’re describing this theoretically, but I love what you’re doing with games and will continue to read with great pleasure everything that you write on the subject. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>So don’t ever stop!                         </div>

You misread me, I think. If we agree that the GM's prep has a special diegetic status, then we've agreed that it takes priority over potentially contradictory material that someone may attempt to introduce "into the transcript" (which, somewhat confusingly), the Big Model takes to mean the account of (fictional) in-game events. What people say at the table as well as other game-mechanical and play-related texts, in contrast, is "Ephemera"). The important point is that <i>we agree</i> that the GM's prep takes priority.<br/><br/>So "the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play" includes in some cases "the GM refers to her notes and tells us what's here." It's still Baker-Boss "system." A game without shared imagined events is arguably by definition not a role-playing game. <br/><br/>But if you want to create Chess: The RPG to prove me wrong, that's great. To quote Ron Edwards, via the manuscript of my hopefully forthcoming book about the Forge:
<blockquote>Ron’s comment at a panel at InterNosCon, an Italian gaming convention, in 2010 illustrates the extent to which he was motivated by an ideal of a broad understanding of the possibilities of RPGs as a form. ‘We could be talking about designing and playing better role-playing games,’ he told an audience of about 20 Italian indie gamers. Alternately, ‘We could be talking about breaking that and making a different thing. . . . I’d rather not do that.’ Instead, he went on, ‘I think that there is a productive dynamic between saying I am making a better role-playing game and saying, no, I am making something different. Rather than knowing which one you are doing, perhaps it is better to recognize that there may be a difference between the two but—but it is a dynamic relationship over time . . . Someone could have been trying to make a better role-playing game, and what they did opens up the door to something completely different, or someone could have said, “Oh, no, I am completely different, I am not making a role-playing game,” and what they do inspires someone to make a better role-playing game.’ Ultimately, he said, ‘We don’t know. We don’t know. Just let that be dynamic. Let that—relax about that.’</blockquote> </div>

                            My co-authors and I talk about an issue that seems close to what you mean when you say salience in the <i><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/266197/Fate-Space-Toolkit-o-Prototype-Edition" rel="nofollow">Fate Space Toolkit</a></i>:
<blockquote>We’ll use the term black box to refer to any potentially important science fiction setting element. These are technologies or scientific contrivances, and in some fiction their likely consequences are not fully thought out before their introduction. For example, script writers don’t often consider things like how the nonscarcity economy implied by the existence of food replicators in the Star Trek universe affects the Federation (but see Manu Saadia’s <i>Trekonomics</i> for an extended discussion of the replicator). Though a technology that can manipulate matter at a molecular level is both really powerful and really interesting, it’s not the point of the show, so it gets moved into the background.<br/><br/>So in effect, a black box is Just the Way Things Are, without further consequence<br/>or implication to the setting. It signals that certain problems—like “How do we<br/>get our food while we’re in space?”—are not interesting in the fiction. At least, not<br/>most of the time. But in a Fate Space game, it is often worthwhile to keep track<br/>of black boxes for the times when they can lead to challenges or opportunities<br/>that might prove very interesting, indeed!<br/><br/>For example, any of these fictional details can be treated as a black box: <br/><br/>o Antigravity in the deck plates<br/>o Hyperspace technology<br/>o Personal teleportation belts<br/>o Extended human lifespan<br/><br/>However, once established, a black box can become a plot point in an adventure, even if most of the time it is ignored. Suddenly the grav plates are on the fritz; the power crystals are slowly depleting while the ship is trapped in hyperspace mid-jump; the calibration sensors on this TP-belt are out of alignment; or the captain’s nanogerionic therapy regimen has caused a harmful mutation. Any of these can be an issue that requires time and attention during play. Thus, black boxes can imply, inspire, and collect aspects that make the setting feel more plausible and coherent.</blockquote>
The rules for when a black box or something like it opens up--becomes salient--probably fall into different categories based on Tweet's resolution categories: Drama, Fortune, Karma.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White%26amp">@Bill_White&amp;</a>;lt;br /&gt;I want those GM notes to also be governed by rules. Rules for when and how to add, remove or change things in them. That’s the thing that makes me think that the transcript, the shared imagined events, while important, is not the central “game board” anymore.<br/><br/>I think you, me and Ron are on the same page that whether this or that is different, better, “not a role-playing-game” or whatever, that’s not the productive part of this work.<br/><br/>I want to have rules that operate on a whole new level is what I’m saying.<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22129/what-data-structure-does-your-game-operate-on#latest" rel="nofollow">I broke that out to a new thread</a> so that my dumb semantics argument can continue here:<br/><br/>In the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485112/#Comment_485112" rel="nofollow">chess analogy I made</a> [which is distinct from Jay’s chess analogy but similar to Jeph's chess analogy], both the oldies and the kids were doing the same thing: saying letters &amp; numbers to each other. That was the whole of the game, for both: talking. Neither had a physical board.<br/><br/>The LBCBP obviously applies to the kids’ take on memory chess.<br/><br/>One can also construct a set of rules, with the LBCBP in mind, to construct a fully isomorphic version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)" rel="nofollow">the oldies’ version of the game</a> strictly as operands on the uttered statements.<br/><br/>For example:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/PbtA chess" rel="nofollow">PbtA chess</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>To <b>start the game</b>, say a letter from a through h followed by a 3 or a 4, or say the letter N, followed by a, c, f, or h, and a 3.<br/><br/>Then <b>the second player replies</b> by saying a letter from a through h followed by a 5 or a 6, or saying the letter N followed by a, c, f, or h, and a 6.</p></div></blockquote>etc etc. One <em>could</em> do that. And obviously a chess board [real or imagined] is a great tool when constructing that type of rule set, just like the threat map is a great tool in AW2e.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>for this game “oldies’ memory chess”, it’s much more efficient, relevant, and valuable for rule designers to create rules that primarily operate <em>on the board directly</em> [again: real or imagined] and only secondarily creates utterances such as “exd5”.<br/><br/><strong>We want to do that.</strong><br/><br/>And when the No myth crew <a href="https://big-model.info/wiki/Lumpley_Principle" rel="nofollow">then say</a> “no no no the only things that matter is what are being said, stop pretending that anything else matters, stop trying to make rules about anything else” that can get kinda frustrating.<br/><br/>There’s a looot of appeal to authority from Paul right now (not from you, Bill), “Baker &amp; Care-Boss once said”, “Chris Lehrich once said”, “Fang Langford once said”. And, like, that’s getting to be kinda patronizing. I get it. They were, 15 years ago, hyperfocused on a tiny subset of what I’m interested in. They cared primarily about the subset of diegetical entities that have happened to have been uttered at the table within earshot of another participant. They were into trees that fell in the forest <em>with</em> someone to hear, I’m more interested in all kinds of falling trees. God, Paul, you’re making me feel like a complete schizophrenic, I’m so gaslighted right now. I’m “delusional” for desiring some rules to cover the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22113/when-i-was-lost-and-cried-out-for-blorb-and-couldnt-find-blorb/p1" rel="nofollow">“chasm width” problem</a>. Can someone who gets what I’m talking about please come here and back me up? I’d really appreciate it.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Hello Sandra,<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing contradictory with "I want those GM notes to also be governed by rules. Rules for when and how to add, remove or change things in them." and the LBCBP.  Its an interesting section of game theory and design development.  Maybe even a disruptive area of thought - disruptive in the good sense of radically altering.<br/><br/>Having a game system where the GM actions are tightly prescribed is still System.  The idea of strictly formalizing how the GM can operate while not new has not been explored in depth.  Let the good ideas flow!<br/><br/>But both <a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">@Bill_White</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Vivicent">@Vivicent</a> have the right of the LBCBP.  That the GM game prep gets automatic or highest credibility is still System.  That the players could revolt at something the GM enters into play is a breakdown that the LBCBP covers.  When the players are not in consensus about the SIS play breaks down until the problem is resolved.  That's the LBCBP.<br/><br/>That the GM can and does exercise control of "off-screen"/extra-SIS events is fairly well established.  That you want to create a rigorous system for how that happens is interesting but ultimately a game design issue.  No problem.<br/><br/>The thesis that you're promoting about these "off-screen" actions that have been fully documented prior to play but not in any way (yet) been communicated, validated and integrated into the "fact space"/SIS/text has the same the same weight and validity is what is controversial.  It is the "creating a language in a closet" is not the same as communicating issue.<br/><br/>Of course there is a lot going on outside the SIS in the minds of every player especially the one bearing the burdens of the GM.  To me, this Individual Imagined Space is the awesome sauce of the game.  We plan our actions.  We consider the implications of our or another players actions.  We wonder at the significance of an event.  We worry about our character dying.  We surge with joy at getting the joooools!  We plan short and long term goals.  Perhaps we're thinking about an internal crisis point about our character. Maybe we are angry about an injustice perpetrated upon our character or are plotting revenge.  This is all very player facing and where are hearts are most engaged.  This IIS also covers such things as the players' character sheets and what not.  This is all player facing.<br/><br/>What I think you're getting at is very GM facing.  Rules, regs and procedures for GMing in a certain mode of play that all the players agreed on at the Social Contract Level before playing.  Very cool and have at it.<br/><br/>The proposal that is causing the rukus is claiming that the GM facing part of the game is <i>functionally</i> self-same as the player facing part of the game.  There is absolutely nothing controversial about the GM moving things in the backfield as long as such actions don't impinge directly on the established fact space/SIS.  An army can march on the players hometown while they are adventuring and that is perfectly acceptable as long as it doesn't violate system or the established facts/SIS.  In fact this makes for a living breathing world beyond the myopic view when we focus solely only the hobos.<br/><br/>But to propose that this uncommunicated IIS has the same credibility as shared and validated communications/proposals does run afoul of both the shared and communal parts that are the fundamental process of role-play.<br/><br/>The question that needs to be answered is how that information which is only known to a very specific one (uncommunicated/unshared) equated to the fact space which is a communal communication construct?<br/><br/>Yes private imaginings are a vital part of the game but if they are not put into play in any way ("putting into play" includes having an IIS construct and using it to influence/inform our proposal offered into the fact space/SIS) then from the player facing side we've got nothing.  If what the GM facing stuff does never enters the Proposal stage of play then as far as the players are concerned it never exists.  By analogy the writer's notes may exist but if they never made it into the text the reader never has any knowledge of said writings.  As far as reading goes the unincorporated notes don't exist and don't matter.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

I'm talking about a model framework of understanding how role-play functions.  I have never nor do I ever intend to make negative claims about the utility, joyousness or the nature of your game.  It is a role-playing game and apparently a very good one at that.<br/><br/>Please don't mistake the theory discussion of a proposed method for analyzing play as the same as a critique of the actual game itself.  That is simply not the case.  IOW I make NO claims at all on your game but I am trying to engage in an interlocutory about the powerful claims you make about the process.<br/><br/>For a fairly long time role-play theory has been based on the transactional model of communication and your current theory claims suggest that you disagree with that.  That's a huge claim to make.  Like....wow! Huge.<br/><br/>I doubt this will make things any easier but I will say them again for clarity's sake.  I've read your threads on design with fascination and wonder.  I like my style of play but I appreciate the effort, beauty and most importantly the reported successes of your design efforts.  My arguments have been only and strictly for the theory side.<br/><br/>I'm sorry that I haven't been a better communicator and I'm sorry that my shortcoming as such have caused you distress.  I've tried to be civil and stay on topic and if I've failed I can only claim my humanity with all its attendant failings and offer you my apologies in the hope you accept them.<br/><br/>All the best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            I have always understood Baker-Care-Boss principle to be a definition of "system" in Forge theory; that "system" in the Forge sense means precisely the way things are brought into the shared imagined space, which I have understood to mean the parts of the fiction that has been shared among at least some players around the table and have been accepted as true.<br/><br/>I do think this definition of system can be used when discussing a sandbox/klockwerk/blorb games - as others have more-or-less written above, it simply states that the procedures for upholding the game state or the fiction are parts of the system that give credibility to claims concerning what gets to enter the shared imagined space. I think that this is a fruitful path.<br/><br/>The same definition could be used to discuss highly immersive play, or character optimization play where showing off your creation is what happens in play, while the actual optimization happens between the sessions.<br/><br/>However, in all of these cases, the Forge definition of system describes fewer of the salient features of play than it does for play with focus on narrative authority, or for essentially improvised play.<br/><br/>* The point of character optimization (in a game where the group appreciates it) is not to be able to add certain utterances into the fiction, but rather to be able to achieve system mastery and find interesting combinations and loopholes. Showing off your creation in play is of course nice and all, but does not require the convoluted jungle of mechanics.<br/>* The point of highly immersive play is not the input you give into the shared fiction. Hopefully that will be more interesting and dramatic due to your immersion, but, as far as I understand, the immersion itself is the point. And, indeed, Forge theory has had serious problems with understanding people who hold immersion as a dear goal in play. Harsh words have been exchanged in the past, I think.<br/>* The point with sandbox/klokkverk/blorb is not the fact that one can refer to prep and random tables to add credibility to certain statements, but rather the solid fiction and whatever ways it is being used - as an arena for challenges, as making the narrative the game creates feel more real, etc.<br/><br/>This suggests that one should pay more attention to other things when discussing these other types of games. And this is what some of the relevant communities have been doing:<br/><br/>* Character optimizers do their theoretical optimization stuff. They do not pay attention to who adds to the fiction and when.<br/>* People who want specific emotional experiences have traditionally discussed props, candle light, how a story should be structured, etc., and more recently the structured freeform/Fastaval/jeep people seem to also be aiming for creating certain intense experiences, and the fiction in their games is often fairly nebulous and not that central (when compared to traditional games or many Forge games). I might utterly wrong here; feel free to correct, if so.<br/>* OSR people pay a lot of attention on how to abstract the game world, what kind of content should be in the game world, and, for a different take, on how the referee should act to keep the game state solid and communicate this to the players. This "different take" is influenced by the Forge system thinking and it seems to mostly have been done at Story games and by some people with background in PbtA play; this is the "fruitful path" I mentioned above. The concerns about abstracting and nature of content are more widely discussed and more distant from Forge system and credibility of narration.                        </div>

One would hope Apocalypse world (2010) to be more self-aware than old school D&amp;D (1974-1986, leaving AD&amp;D 2 out, or -1991, if the third edition is where we draw the line).<br/><br/>Claiming that for example PbtA community is more or less self aware than OSR community would, on the other hand, be quite argumentative and difficult to settle without some serious research: conceptual work (how to measure self-awareness?) and empirical work.                        </div>

                            Going through the same example with the transactional model:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Finch" rel="nofollow">Finch</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>GM: “A ten-foot wide corridor leads north into the darkness.”</p></div></blockquote>GM wants to use talking to describe an adventurous location, he incidentally engages his notes <em>[such as a dungeon map]</em> in order to find what details he can add to the fiction (such as the width, cardinal direction, and light), and then talks. The GM then leaves a pause in order to allow John to add a statement to the fiction.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Finch" rel="nofollow">Finch</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>John the Roguish: “We move forward, poking the floor ahead with our ten foot pole.”</p></div></blockquote>John wants to use talking in order to describe a story about a forward motion through a corridor, he incidentally engages his knowledge about the character’s capabilities, such as having legs, a non-zero movement rate, and a particular pole.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Finch" rel="nofollow">Finch</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>GM: Is about to say that the pole pushes open a pit trap, when he remembers something. “Wait, you don’t have the ten foot pole any more. You fed it to the stone idol.” [if the party still had the pole, John would have detected the trap automatically]<br/>John the Roguish: “I didn’t feed it to the idol, the idol ate it when I poked its head.”<br/>GM: “That doesn’t mean you have the pole back.”</p></div></blockquote>GM wants to add a pit trap to the fiction, and incidentally consults his notes to see that he is both allowed and obliged to add a pit trap to this particular location. He mentally refers back to his recollection of the transcript and recalls that it has previously been established in the fiction that John’s incidental capabilities (the pole) have been dimished. He realizes that the fiction has been compromised by a mistake and issues a correction.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Finch" rel="nofollow">Finch</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>GM: “Do you go into the corridor?”</p></div></blockquote>The GM knows that it’s John’s turn to add a statement to the fiction and creates a prompt for him to do so.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Finch" rel="nofollow">Finch</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>John the Roguish: “No. I’m suspicious. Can I see any cracks in the floor, maybe shaped in a square?”</p></div></blockquote>John wants to use narration to portray a canny and cautious young man so he adds a statement to the fiction that implies that he is attempting to examine the floor.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Finch" rel="nofollow">Finch</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><del>GM: Mulls this over, because there’s a pit trap right where John is looking. But it’s dark, so</del></p></div></blockquote>That’s not how a GM would reason if the transactional model were true. Instead:<br/><br/>“GM: Wants the fiction to portray this adventure location as very challenging and also hammer home his previous addition to the fiction about the light situation so he says”
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Finch" rel="nofollow">Finch</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>“No, there are about a million cracks in the floor. You wouldn’t see a pit trap that easily, anyway.”</p></div></blockquote>and then
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Finch" rel="nofollow">Finch</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>John the Roguish: “Okay. I take out my waterskin from my backpack. And I’m going to pour some water onto the floor. Does it trickle through the floor anywhere, or reveal some kind of pattern?”</p></div></blockquote>John wants to pile on to the portrayal of this canny and cautious adventurer and incidentally engages his list of gear in order to add to the fiction, including embelleshing the the previously establish part of this fiction, the floor.<br/><br/>As you can see, I do understand the transactional model. I just think it’s not the best fit for the type of design work I want to do.<br/><br/>I want to see what designs we can create when not shackled to this model.<br/><br/>For example, here is a part where the transactional model is stretched thin:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>GM wants to add a pit trap to the fiction, and incidentally consults his notes to see that he is both allowed and obliged to add a pit trap to this particular location.</p></div></blockquote>In the transactional model, rules cannot govern whether or not a pit trap <em>is</em> present at a location.<br/><br/>Instead, if you want to model a fully blorb game with the transactional model, you need to create a rule that says where you are allowed&amp;obliged to add, and where you are disallowed to add, pit traps into the uttered-at-the-table fiction, and that rule incidentally engages the prep.<br/><br/>But if you’re not forcing the design through the transactional model, you can just straight forwardly make rules that govern how or when pit traps are added to the prep because the prep is no longer something that you have to engage with incidentally; instead you can engage with it primarily <em>as part of the game state</em>, since the game state is the fundamental layer.<br/><br/> </div>

                            So, for my own edification and clarification, at this point the debate is about whether:<br/><br/>An RPG is a conversation about what happens in the SIS. The system (as understood by the B-C-B Principle) is what we use to decide how that conversation is allowed to determine what happens in the SIS.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>An RPG is (or can be) an exercise in manipulating an Objective Game State. The system exists to allow players (including the DM) to both ascertain what is true about the current game state and affect change upon the game state and then determine how the game state is affected.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Furthermore, we are also arguing whether:<br/><br/>Both of these statements can accurately describe what is happening in an individual game, and thus if one is true about one game and another is true about another, then those two games might not be of the same type? (The terminology used to label and differentiate between these different types being a whole can of worms any sane person would probably want to avoid given past atrocities)<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>Only one of the above statements is true about the type of game we call an RPG<b></b>, and anyone arguing for the false proposition is simply [using inaccurate language to describe/is deluded about] what is actually happening in the game?<br/><br/>Or am I off-base?<br/> </div>

There are very few claims about the game world that every player has met in play.<br/><br/>And these different games certainly have affected each other - an angel was summoned in a Burning wheel game quite some years ago, it has been central for a partially overlapping group of players, while a completely separate group of players has been interested but is yet to meet it.</p></div></blockquote>
Having given this some thought I propose that what you are describing is nothing more than persistence of Setting.  As role-play is a group communicative process for that Setting information to relevant to the play process it must be entered into the SIS.  Here's where the hangup seems to be manifesting.  What does communication mean?  It can mean spoken words, written text, somatic actions by the players, dice, cards, silence when that act of silence communicates information - such as when a character refuses to answer a direct order under heavy penalty to divulge information, describing the effects of something unknown to the players is having on the Setting, etc.<br/><br/>Even if this communication takes place out of game session the LBCB Principle still holds once play begins.  Basically the LBCB Principle covers whether or not the out of game information is usable by the PC's <i>in</i> game.  This happens all the time with players reading the rules and setting information about the game.<br/><br/>That the GM has more Setting information or can create Setting information through random tables or direct creative efforts is nothing new or controversial.  That the GM bears the responsibility for maintaining this continuity of Setting is nothing new.<br/><br/>Since RPG play has always been played as a <i>process of change</i> and not a state or condition of being that process of change has always been communicated, regulated and agreed upon.  It's not enough for the players to sit and stare at each other.  While it is necessary, it is not sufficient that only the GM communicating to call that process roleplay.  If that were the case someone reading out loud to an audience would be called roleplay.<br/><br/>I don't deny and have never denied what I am now calling Setting persistence.  I'm saying that Setting Persistence doesn't matter to player agency if that persistent information does not affect the SIS <i>in some way</i>.<br/><br/>So my two questions to you are - <br/><br/>1.  How was the information about the Angel summoning communicated amongst your various groups?  (Especially with regards to the completely isolated group)<br/><br/>2.  By what manner of system did you use to allow such information to be acted upon by the PC's?  (Remembering that you as the GM just hand waving the problem away is still System)<br/><br/>Your example didn't include who did the actual summoning of the Angel, but whoever did it the effect of that summoning was communicated, validated and integrated into the SIS.  Setting was changed.  Nothing you've described invalidates the notion of the SIS.  For the player group that was completely isolated from the Summoning event game session <i>someone</i> communicated that information to them if, as you've said, the players are expressing interest in it.<br/><br/>What I'm <i>not</i> saying is that the Fact Space/SIS is the everything of role-playing.  We have the Social Contract.  We have Creative Agenda's.  We have our plans about what we want to accomplish during the game.  Etc.  All these are vital to us engaging in roleplay but until we've starting Exploring (the act of using the Elements of Exploration which includes System - the LBCB Principle) we haven't started play.  They are all <i>necessary</i> but as activities they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not sufficient</span> to be regarded as roleplay<i>ing</i>.  We can all agree to meet at Alice's and all agree to play (pick whatever RPG you want) at 8pm on Tuesday night.  But that's not roleplay<i>ing</i>.  We can agree on the Technique that there is a separation of information between the players and the GM.<br/><br/>I'm saying the SIS is the arena where roleplaying happens which results in changes to Setting.  Pre-game Prep whether taken from a book, made up whole cloth, a mix of both, a map or taken from another game session is still Setting.  It should be noted for completeness that there are games that distribute the duties/roles of the GM around the table but again those games have a System that regulates and empowers that activity.<br/><br/>But to answer your question about table having its own SIS then short answer is yes.  To what extent that information is shared amongst your various groups is a matter of the Social Contract.  But whatever information that is shared/common to the groups is a matter of Social Contract.  As far as the Agency allowed to players to employ such information that is a matter of the LBCB Principle describing what information is allowed to the PCs and what is restricted to the Players only.<br/><br/>Finally it should be noted that whatever information that is allowed to be shared between groups the players still have to all agree on it as well.  For one reason or another a player could contest some aspect of the Setting you've provided which is still under the LBCBP.  This may be extremely rare to actually come about but tacit passive approval is still occuring.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Hi Jay,<br/><br/>I mostly agree with you, and I do not think that discussing that further is fruitful.<br/><br/>Rather, (in hindsight I believe) I was grasping at the following simple observation: The Forge definition of system and characterization of the process of roleplaying is moment-to-moment, and highly local in time.<br/><br/>As you correctly write, the definition does not care why we are introducing something into the fiction, it just asks if everyone involved accepts the input. The criterion for acceptance is defined as the system.<br/><br/>This is also why all the games that have a game master (who has narrative authority over the world) and players (who are restricted to their characters perspective and taking actions through the character) look like pretty much the same game from a Forge lens: The *moment-to-moment* means of accepting input is mostly the same. Maybe people get credibility for their statements by reading dice and character sheets in different ways, but that is surface detail, not fundamental in any way.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the player has metagame currencies that influence the character's performance, or if different parts of character performance require rolling dice than "usual", than the Forge definition of system starts seeing differences.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Let us take a look at two games, one a no myth game, the other a sandbox/blorb/klokkverk game, but with the traditional player-GM divide and nominally the same rule system in both.<br/><br/>The big model definition of system sees very little difference; maybe it adds a side clause about the GM prep adding to credibility of the statements in one, or about the GM having to respect their prep.<br/><br/>Similar phenomenon happens with two otherwise identical games, where one contains an intricate system of character creation and in the other the player or game master simply writes down a bunch of values that seem to fit the character. This has little effect on who can say what and when so that it is accepted into fiction; basically, when introducing a character, it has to have a certain number of points total in one game, but not the other.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Suppose we want to, for whatever reason, discuss the intricacies of running a persistent game world, or of having a compelling character optimization in a game.<br/><br/>As another issue, suppose we are considering a fate token rule for a game - what they are good for and when they are earned.<br/><br/>In the latter case, the Baker-Care-Boss principle definition of system is quite useful. Does the player have the right to declare their character successful, or that a minor fact is true, or that a major fact is true, or that their relationship appears in the scene, etc.<br/><br/>In the first case, thinking through the same definition gives far less - questions of realism or balance  between options are more relevant.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I would be tempted to say that the locality of time of the big model definition explains why almost all Forge games are short-form games, but this is likely a poor explanation.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>From a sandbox point of view, Apocalypse world and its descendants are the only (probably: "among the few rare"; exceptions likely exist) relevant games with their roots in the Forge, because they pay attention to creating and maintaining the game world via clocks and fronts and what not. Other games just assume you do it.<br/><br/>Yeah, okay, Dogs in the vineyard mentions revisiting towns, Burning wheel has circles and relationship rules and resources as an attempt at abstracting essentially non-modern economics. Not entirely irrelevant in that way.<br/><br/>I wonder if anything useful (from sandbox point of view) has come out of the Fate community. Star system generation in Diaspora, maybe.                        </div>

                            It just bugs me when someone says
<ol><li>System is defined by the LBCBP to only cover what we imagine in play</li><li>The rules are defined by the LBCBP to be a strict subset of system</li><li>Therefore a game can not have rules that cover things outside of what we imagine in play</li></ol><strong>That has actually happened in this thread.</strong><br/>And on the Forge.<br/><br/>Not that people are interested in the LBCBP or impressed by it, but that they then also conclude that it means that it therefore <strong>must be</strong> allowable for the DM in <em>any</em> “real roleplaying game” to do unblorby things.<br/><br/>And I’m like… this is a kinda tired old cliché but the whole bumblebee thing? For a brief moment in 1934 there was a calculation that showed that bumblebees couldn’t actually fly because dynamic stall in the oscillation cycle wasn’t wholly understood.<br/><br/>You can use the six letter string “system” to mean whatever you want in your game, and you can use the five letter string “rules” to mean whatever you want in your game, and, like, that’s fine, don’t mind us, we’re trying to fly over here? This is also why I called it blorb by the way. A new &amp; fresh &amp; wholly alien word <em>untouched by Forge</em>.<br/><br/>We want to write… well, if you can’t call them rules, you can call them them “principles of prep” or whatever. (We’re gonna just go ahead and call them “rules” though.)<br/><br/>When you’re too in love with the LBCBP, instead of just making an ambush team as a virtual ludeme and making Dremmer’s territory as a virtual ludeme, instead, with their model, you need to script a rule that triggers when we <em>talk about</em> Dremmer’s territory <em>as if</em> it were a ludeme. But it’s not. They’re only pretending to pretend that there’s a territory, instead of doing the more straightforward thing which would be to pretend that there’s a territory. Easier.<br/><br/>And, like, it’s completely assymmetrical.<br/><br/>The <em>player</em> still needs to “create” their character, “create” their chopper gang, “create” their hardhold. They need to be “delusional” and have these things of theirs expressed in ontological terms like “created”.<br/><br/>I.o.w. the player-facing ludemes <strong>are</strong> still expressed as “instances”, as “objects” while the MC-facing ludemes are, in order to not be delusional, expressed as “procedures”, as “functions”.<br/><br/><img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/> Traditional techniques, man!<br/><br/>That’s why I have zero qualms with a super hippiefied game, because those games don’t have this assymmetry.<br/><br/><small>Also, I almost made some “deludeme” portmanteus about delude and ludeme but it ended up as “delude me” which wasn’t great.</small><br/><br/> </div>

In practical terms, for some people at least, it's not easier. Making the ambush team and making the territory and making the mechanisms by which they interact with each other and the players' characters to determine if the ambush is successful creates many, many opportunities for mistakes which can end up skewing the situation you wanted to model in the first place: sometimes you get ambushed, sometimes you don't.<br/><br/>For some people at least, it's easier to just say: sometimes you get ambushed, sometimes you don't.<br/><br/>That approach does have other disadvantages: for most people it feels less "real" or "solid". But I don't think it's accurate to say it's more difficult.                        </div>

                            What I meant was more difficult writing a disciplined LBCBP <i>game</i>, such as the MC half of AW. Translating the experience of a traditional game into a "The SIS is the central operand" mode required a pretty deep understanding of the theory. I mean, I sure as heckfire didn't understand this stuff to that level back in 2010 before AW came out. (Still a couple of years before "mirror story".)<br/><br/>And even then you can see spots here and there where there are cracks in the discipline.<br/><br/>This is going to get nerdy but in programming terms,<br/>AW is the Haskell of games. No sideeffects allowed so we have to jump through some hoops (monads) to create some of the same feel.<br/>2097e is more of a Lisp. Meta-aware, sure, but a multidiscipline, inelegant, wonderful ball of mud.                        </div>

                            It seems to me that the topic has now shifted somewhat to, "Hey, let's think of some interesting ways to improve klockwerk play", which I love and think could be very fruitful.<br/><br/>I feel that the discussion of the Lumpley Principle is just distracting us from that good stuff; it seems entirely unrelated, from where I'm sitting. <br/><br/>I'd recommend removing that from this discussion, if that's the goal (and I hope it is!).<br/><br/>Otherwise, I'm not sure how to interact with this conversation at all. (For example, those "two analyses of Finchian trap-finding" were both severely misguided, in my view, either misrepresenting roleplaying as an activity or conflating motives with tools, respectively. That makes it hard for me to continue the conversation, other than to state my disagreement and attempt to change the subject. You seem to be conflating the idea of "No Myth", Narrativism, story-telling, Forge-style design, the differences between sandbox play and improvised collaborative gaming, and the Lumpley Principle all into one big soup. If you want to pursue this further, please tell me how you'd like to proceed!)<br/><br/>I'm very curious how you would parse my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485398/#Comment_485398" rel="nofollow">example in the other thread</a> from a mental model of roleplaying which includes a "game state" (or whatever we want to call it).

The logic here doesn't hold up as Rules and System were never defined to be the same.  From the <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">Provisional Glossary</a> -
<blockquote><b>Rules:</b><br/><br/>Textual instruction about (a) anything and everything concerning role-playing this particular game, or (b) specifically Techniques and Ephemera. Used in this sense, Rules are distinct from the System actually employed during play, although it may be used as a reference or justification for it.</blockquote>
So, no, the Forge never said that, "A game can not have rules that cover things outside of what we imagine in play."<br/><br/>The process of creating a character typically has Rules about the activity.  Dogs in the Vineyard has Rules detailing how to create the town.  Rules about under what circumstances to roll a random encounter fall into this camp.  Typically there are Rules about how to go about leveling up a character.  <a href="http://www.tao-games.com/polaris/" rel="nofollow">Polaris</a> (by Ben Lehman) had Rules about who had control over the protagonist, the villain, the spurned lover, the angry authority figure and when those roles changed.<br/><br/>The short of it is lots of games (all?) have Rules about how to play the game that don't directly deal with the SIS.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>Crossposted with Paul.                        </div>

                            I’ll get into that dragon post shortly.<br/><br/>First of all, about me falling out of love with AW…<br/><br/>I also want to add something (that I already wrote in an email to Paul today but I think it’s appropriate for here, too) that:<br/><br/>AW is a masterpiece of IIEE. It seems to me that it came straight out of Vincent’s groundbreaking work on IIEE with the dice &amp; cloud series, which is a series that I absolutely love and has been thoroughly influenced by.<br/><br/>If I want to solve an IIEE issue I have no qualms turning to AW.<br/><br/>My issue with AW is only on the, uh, let’s call it data structure layer instead of “ontological” layer.<br/><br/>About this thread…<br/><br/>I’m glad that the other thread has a very strict “productive-only” focus. This thread though has been about all kinds of things, and one of those things is a couple of lingering questions about this theory stuff.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For example, those “two analyses of Finchian trap-finding” were both severely misguided, in my view, either misrepresenting roleplaying as an activity or conflating motives with tools, respectively.</p></div></blockquote>Paul, throughout this thread you’ve been doing this. “This is severely misguided”, “this is wrong”, “here I disagree”, “this is deluded”… Care to elaborate?<br/><br/>I made the formatting of the posts easier to quote just for that purpose, so if there are several fundamental issues with my analyses (I’m sure there are plenty nitpicks of minor errors, I can be pretty sloppy), I’d love to know what they are, or given the opportunity to respond in detail.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I always feel like everything I write on here just becomes discarded (whereas in email you’re being very thorough which is very much appreciated).<br/><br/>This seems like a very strong mental lock for you. “Our model has been so thoroughly hashed out, it was so painful hashing that stuff out, it improved my gaming so much, it can’t be wrong”. <strong>I’m not disagreeing with the second or third of those four thoughts.</strong> I’m not about to make gaming worse or forbid all non-blorby play. For example, your own Éowyn game has hippiefied mechanics rather than traditional, so is already not a problem.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>either misrepresenting roleplaying as an activity</p></div></blockquote><em>(I take it this one is for the blorby analysis.)</em><br/><br/>In blorby play, interacting with our primary-level data-structure, the canon, the mutual (not necessarily “sense-four-shared”) imagined space (The MIS! A superset of the SIS!) is the fundamental operation.<br/><br/>Talking is incidental;<br/>sometimes as a <em>result</em> of operating on the MIS,<br/>more often as a way of <em>communicating</em> changes to the MIS (“I go through the door”) or information about the MIS (“there are three trolls there”)<br/><br/>If this is a radically different model than your model of what “roleplaying as an activity” is, then, well, that <strong>is</strong> noteworthy, wouldn’t you say? If it’s not, and you guys should know better than me if it is or isn’t, then what’s the problem?<br/><br/>Speaking of “roleplaying as an activity”… when you’re a kid and you play a game such as “I’m a ghost” or “the floor is lava” or “this doll is my baby, Susan”,<br/><br/>step one is that you pretend that it is so,<br/>step two is that you make actions and statements as if it were so,<br/>to the extent that they aren’t overridden by very practical limitations (such as not <em>actually</em> trying to walk through a wall when you pretend you’re a ghost, and not <em>actually</em> try to swim when you pretend the bed is a pirate ship and you are “swimming” (walking on the floor but making swimming motions with arms) to “rescue Susan” (fetch doll).<br/><br/>While there’s a bit of an overlap, this is fundamentally different from “yarn-spinning” as an activity, where you add statements to a story, incorporating or embellishing or correcting previously added statements to said story.<br/><br/>Either your model recognizes that, in which case fine, please clearly acknowledge that, or it doesn’t, in which case: let’s dig into it! I’m convincable but I need to hear arguments!

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>First of all, thank you for making your posts so much easier to quote! That's really lovely, and very helpful. <br/><br/>Second, it looks like I should explain where I'm coming from a little more clearly. Let me try to do that!
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I’ll get into that dragon post shortly.</p></div></blockquote>
I think the issue of the green dragon in my example is directly relevant to this topic, so I look forward to your description of that kind of play event. (Edit: looks like you've done so in the other thread. Should I address it in full there?)
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>First of all, about me falling out of love with AW…<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>AW is a masterpiece of IIEE. It seems to me that it came straight out of Vincent’s groundbreaking work on IIEE with the dice &amp; cloud series, which is a series that I absolutely love and has been thoroughly influenced by.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>My issue with AW is only on the, uh, let’s call it data structure layer instead of “ontological” layer.</p></div></blockquote>
So, first of all, the clarity which AW has in regards to issues like IIEE (which is the type of thing that you can really ONLY consider from the standpoint of the Lumpley Principle; it was basically absent prior to that understanding) is exactly what I meant by the text being more "self-aware". It's not necessarily a net positive, but from a designer's standpoint it's really handy, and it arguably does a better job of teaching people how to play.<br/><br/>Now, what is your issue with the "data structure layer"? It seems to me that AW is not a "full blorb" game, nor does it try to be. So, if that's your qualm with it, I don't think anyone will argue that you're wrong. (Well, actually, lots of people will. But I won't! I think you're right on.)<br/><br/>Or do you think there's something fundamentally, philosophically wrong with the way the game is put together? That would be a much stronger, and more controversial/interesting claim.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Paul, throughout this thread you’ve been doing this. “This is severely misguided”, “this is wrong”, “here I disagree”, “this is deluded”… Care to elaborate?<br/><br/>I made the formatting of the posts easier to quote just for that purpose, so if there are several fundamental issues with my analyses (I’m sure there are plenty nitpicks of minor errors, I can be pretty sloppy), I’d love to know what they are, or given the opportunity to respond in detail.</p></div></blockquote>
Yeah, so what is Paul's problem here? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I've been trying to figure out how to engage with all these conversations, because I think you're often finding yourself in the position of feeling assaulted from all sides. And that's unfortunate - after all, I feel we're all friends here, and, as far as I can see, no one's deliberately trying to put anyone down. I don't want you to feel "set upon", as by a pack of hungry wolves.<br/><br/>However, here's my problem:<br/><br/>* I love what you're doing from a design perspective, and I love exploring and finding new "blorb/klockwerk" tools, because they can really improve a certain style of gaming. So I want to engage with that and support it and offer my own ideas. It's some great stuff, and it's what's got me coming back to Story Games every day lately. Wonderful!<br/><br/>* However, I either don't follow or strongly disagree with your theoretical thoughts on the matter. Sometimes it feels like you're trying to redefine the way we look at RPG play in order to legitimize your favoured playstyle. <br/><br/>This is tricky, because, on one hand, that doesn't mean I can't engage with the practical stuff (e.g. designing random encounter tables). On the other hand, there's a danger of getting mired into a whole semantic swamp and missing out on cool techniques. However, I also like theoretical thinking about RPGs, and I like challenging existing ideas and coming up with new models because they can give us new avenues for design and play. <br/><br/>So, what to do?<br/><br/>If I ignore the theory stuff, you feel like your points are being ignored and overlooked (fair!). If I engage with it and critique what I see as its weak points, then I sound obstinate and I make you feel like you're on the defensive.<br/><br/>So, I choose to take a middle ground by pointing out that I don't agree with the theory, and to preferentially engage with the more practical topics.<br/><br/>It sounds like you'd really like me to challenge the theory, though, and address that. I'm happy to do so; in exchange, I'll ask you to give me the benefit of the doubt and not to assume that I'm being close-minded or mean-spirited. I very much see this as a friendly and interesting dialogue!<br/>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>In blorby play, interacting with our primary-level data-structure, the canon, the mutual (not necessarily “sense-four-shared”) imagined space (The MIS! A superset of the SIS!) is the fundamental operation.<br/><br/>Talking is incidental;<br/>sometimes as a <em>result</em> of operating on the MIS,<br/>more often as a way of <em>communicating</em> changes to the MIS (“I go through the door”) or information about the MIS (“there are three trolls there”)<br/></p></div></blockquote>
Ok. I really like this; I think it's the clearest restatement you've made so far of what you're reaching for with this whole "gamestate" idea. <br/><br/>Perhaps the analogy is one of a board game, which has defined positions and moves, and we talk only to communicate our moves to each other. <br/><br/>I'd initially thought that no change of the Situation (in Forge terms) can happen without talking, but perhaps you are right that sometimes such change happens with very little overt communication. (e.g. I can cross off a potion on my character sheet and increment my HP, and we all know that, in the SIS, my character drank a potion.)<br/><br/>The question, then, becomes whether this somehow violates the idea of the Lumpley Principle. I'd always understood it as being entirely in line with it: the original text of the Principle doesn't say anything about talking, and it seems silly to pretend that things like illustrations, maps, miming a sword swing, taking on the body position/posture of a character I'm playing, and so forth don't affect what we're imagining.<br/><br/>I can see, though, that the Wiki you're quoting says that "nothing happens, in the fiction of role-playing, unless someone says it and it's heard by others". I would have thought this was just sloppy writing (after all, 99% of the time we DO say these things out loud), but I can see how - if you took it literally - you'd think it was bogus.<br/><br/>However, I think the original text of Principle - how we agree to imagined events during play - is fairly self-evident. Can you think of any counterexamples?<br/> </div>

Indeed! This is why some of us are reacting the way we are. It's an extremely noteworthy and bold claim!<br/><br/>It might qualify as a really interesting claim, if not for the perception (and I'll keep my mind open about whether this is fair or not) that this is just the "old" way of looking at gaming.<br/><br/>Before the Forge days, there was a pretty dominant perception that RPGs didn't really work like other games. Instead, we had an imaginary reality, a virtual world, and the "game rules were the physics of that world". I remember this being fairly doctrinal in the 90's, at least. Pretty much everyone I knew who played RPGs spoke of the process in this way.<br/><br/>For instance, the rule for an attack roll was engaged when a fictional entity made a physical attack against another entity, and the outcome determined the fictional/diegetic outcome (the target was hit, let's say). This kind of rule is written with no concern for the actual, real-table activity in which it's taking place; it presumes the "reality" of the diegesis/game world as a given.<br/><br/>What it led to was a real stagnation in RPG design and all kinds of evolutionary dead-ends. (Like I said earlier, it's pretty hard to design something with the clarity of AW's IIEE when looking at gaming from this lens.)<br/><br/>So, the idea was that the Lumpley Principle was a broader understanding, breaking us free of that kind of limited thinking.<br/><br/>Now you're trying to bring on board something that sounds suspiciously like that old-time kind of thinking about RPGs. Do you feel that your "game state" theory/concept is meaningfully distinct from that kind of pre-Forgean view of RPG play? If so, how so? 
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>While there’s a bit of an overlap, this is fundamentally different from “yarn-spinning” as an activity, where you add statements to a story, incorporating or embellishing or correcting previously added statements to said story.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
So, this is the rather bold and interesting claim: that there is a fundamental difference between RPG play or "make believe" and collaborative storytelling.<br/><br/>I can see some rationale for that! Certainly, a game where I am strictly limited to actor stance (e.g. many/most of the trad RPG tradition) and a game where we get to make stuff up together *feel* quite different.<br/><br/>But, off the top of my head, I can think of a dozen examples of corner cases that defy categorization, hybrid forms, and so forth. So I'd have to hear WHY you feel these are fundamentally different, and then how you can think of any kind of hybrid game (which most RPGs are, at root) within a framework where those two things are fundamentally different activities. How do you explain something like AW or Sorcerer or The Pool from that point of view?

I'm running out of time, so I'll make this short (feel free to ask questions).<br/><br/>In short, your analysis part one (from a blorby perspective), I feel, omits some pretty important details, by pretending to ignore the real people playing and their interactions.<br/><br/>It describes what's happening pretty well, but the references to a "game state", even though it often doesn't exist outside of the utterances of the players (e.g. those cracks in the floor simply did not exist in any sense until the player asked about them), have to be supported. I also think that, aside from the mentions of the 'game state', it's a perfectly accurate and 100% Lumpley Principle-compatible analysis of what's happening there.<br/><br/>However, then you move to what you and Jay are calling the "transactional model" and suddenly you are conflating the means of play (we talk) with the motives (we're trying to tell a story).<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>"John wants to use narration to portray a canny and cautious young man so he adds a statement to the fiction that implies that he is attempting to examine the floor."<br/><br/>This is complete straw doll, in my opinion. You've somehow decided (perhaps because of that line on the wiki page!) that accepting the Lumpley Principle means that all roleplay is a structured narrative that we consciously construct.<br/><br/>I don't know why - either it's that one line in the wiki, or your idea that Forge theory means we can't have rules about things other than what we say (which is downright silly - obviously we can make rules like "at 30 minutes past the hours, change seats with your partner"), or your recent interest in separating "full blorb" from "freeform storytelling" games, even though thousands of hybrid games exist and are played every day.<br/><br/>But, coming back to your "transactional model" analysis of finchian trap-finding, that is not true at all. The "John" in the example is doing no such thing. There's no "story being told" - we're exploring an imaginary space which it is the GM's responsibility to describe as accurately and consistently as she can. John's describing his character's actions to the GM, which is the way the group has agreed to "imagined events during play": his role is to describe his character's actions, and he's doing so because he wants to avoid his character getting stuck in a trap (a likely hint that this might be a Gamist kind of venture, or at least one where John's responsibility is to advocate for his character's survival and success).<br/><br/>Sure, we could make a game where that's not the case - something like Donjon, perhaps - but that would be a different game.<br/><br/>In short, you've created a (nearly) accurate analysis and said that it conforms to your model, and then a rather caricatured and strange analysis where for some reason two people playing D&amp;D are trying to "tell a story" as their primary motive and don't seem to understand how Finchian trap-finding even works, and are trying to say that this analysis discredits the Lumpley Principle.<br/><br/>One thing I would be very interested to see, which I keep coming back to, is how the "game state" model can explain uncorrected errors in play. Like my example where the GM reads "green dragon" instead of "green goblin", but *never realizes the mistake*. Let's say you and I play a D&amp;D campaign, and such an error occurs. (And never mind that such errors, large or small, intentional or unintentional, happen all the time!) Is it really your position that it means something, years later, to say, "Sandra and Paul played D&amp;D back in 2019, but we, scientists looking back at them, now in the year 2097* can say that their memory of the game is incorrect; in fact, the 'game state' they were interacting with had a <i>green goblin</i>, not a dragon, and they just repeatedly made error after error, including descriptions, character decisions, numbers of hit points, and so on. The REAL game they played had a green goblin, not a green dragon; they're just misremembering."<br/><br/>How can the "game state" model account for the persistence of such errors? Or even non-errors like those cracks in the floor or the identity of the green dragon (as having been rescued by the PC's father, in my example)? <br/><br/>I hope that helps rather than aggravates. I am happy to drop this entire debate, if you prefer! <br/><br/><br/>*: Just for fun! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> It will be a good year.<br/><br/> </div>

Wait, wait, wait!<br/><br/>Some imaginary reality, some virtual world, is <b>NOT</b> at all what I mean when I write "game state".<br/><br/>The game state is a logical structure.<br/><br/>It constrains imagined events. It <i>is not identical to</i> the imagined events. It <i>is not</i> a virtual world where those events take place.<br/><br/>We're playing D&amp;D 5e. My guy, Alice, has 0 hit points. (That's part of the game state.) This applies a constraint that, in imagined events, Alice is incapacitated.<br/><br/>If I share this portion of the game state, saying "Crap I'm at 0", this makes manifest to all present that, in the diegesis, Alice is incapacitated.<br/><br/>It restricts me, preventing me from saying, "Alice gets up and stabs the orc." Because contributions to imagined events that contradict the constraints of the game state are invalid.<br/><br/>Do we agree that this is a totally, completely different thing from saying "There's an imaginary reality, a virtual world, and the game rules are the physics of that world"?<br/><br/><small>I'll also note that Sandra and I are totally not on the same page re: game state and the LBCB Principle. I think the principle works as originally stated: "System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play." So written, the LBCB Principle is 100% compatible with the idea of game state; the game stat's constraints on imagined events are just a means by which we agree to those imagined events.<br/><br/>I also think that the entire Big Model Wiki entry on the LBCB Principle is crap. It is NOT the principle itself; it is rather bad commentary on the thing, and totally fails to state the thing itself.<br/></small> </div>

<small>Agreed with you 100% on the "small print" stuff at the bottom of your post. I really hope the sloppy wording of that wiki page isn't the thing responsible for this whole debate.<br/><br/>Also: wow, look at this tiny font thing Sandra started finally catching on! Just as S-G is shutting down, too...</small><br/><br/>I don't think I understand the distinction you're trying to make. Are you just saying that the game state includes things outside of the imagined reality (so, being at 0 HP doesn't *just* mean that Alice is incapacitated, it also means that I, Paul, can't say that she attacks anyone)?<br/><br/>I don't have an issue with that, and I don't really see how it changes anything. (And I'm obviously not about to defend the whole "game rules as the physics of the game world" thing; it's wrong on so many levels, and the way rules reach beyond the SIS is an important part of that.)                        </div>

                            Hello,<br/><br/>WRT to the Wiki definition of the LBCB Principle Jeff has the right of it.  It is garbage and the way it was discussed on site did not think of the principle in that way.  It was discussed and treated in the way Jeff quoted from the Provisional Glossary.<br/><br/>FREX - just recently in a game session I posted about a PC being bit by a vampire, trapped under rubble and dug about by another PC.  Near the end of the digging out, where the bitten PC (played by Dax) was being pulled out the Player of the PC doing the rescuing (played by Blake) rolled three 1's in about 5 rolls.  The Player of the rescued PC then rolled two 1's back to back.  At this point the GM looked at Dax and all he did was raise his eyebrows in question.  Dax in return just dipped his chin in the smallest of nods.<br/><br/>It was perfectly clear what was being asked and answered to both the GM and Dax.  Since you rolled two 1's and Blake rolled so many ones are you going to have your character (Silitare) bite Tomas (Blake's character)?  The tiny head nod was a "Yes" and Tomas' current state and future were radically changed.<br/><br/>The LBCB Principle in action using <i>no words</i>.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

The game state includes propositions about `ALICE, like:<br/><br/>(HITPOINTS `ALICE 0)<br/>(EXHAUSTIONLEVELS `ALICE 1)<br/>(SPEED `ALICE 30)<br/>(AC `ALICE 16)<br/>(ATTACKBONUS `ALICE +6)<br/><br/>And stuff like that.<br/><br/>`ALICE is not the imagined character Alice.<br/><br/>However, under our agreed-upon system, there is a causal relationship between the game state token `ALICE and the imagined character Alice. Game state propositions concerning `ALICE constrain imagined events with regards to the character Alice.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>If we wanted to, we could play a game with no gamestate at all, but the exact same imagined events.<br/><br/>Or a game with the exact same imagined events, and a gamestate which includes no token `ALICE. (<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">For instance, The Pool, which has one token for each player, one binary predicate, SIZE_OF_POOL, which takes as arguments a player token and a nonnegative integer; and nothing else.</span> The Pool was a shitty example, since pool size doesn't directly constrain game state. Consider a hypothetical game with one element of game state, a predicate DANGER_LEVEL that can take a boolean argument of True or False; when True, the GM is allowed to harm player characters in the fiction; when False, not.)<br/><br/>Things that are in the diegesis, imagined events, do not necessarily have any correspondence with anything in the game state. The game state is not "imagined events plus some other stuff." It's not even "A portion of imagined events, plus maybe other stuff."<br/><br/>It's a set of propositions: predicates which operate on tokens, logical primitives like numbers and booleans, and other propositions.<br/><br/>The system, in the LBCB Principle sense, includes ways in which this set of propositions constrain what counts as a valid contribution to imagined events. And the system contains ways that we are allowed to, or obligated to, observe and share and mutate the game state.                        </div>

                            In one game, you've written in your prep, "100 GP are in the vestibule." This causes the game state to include:<br/><br/>(CONTAINS `VESTIBULE (GP 100))<br/><br/>Which, combined with our system, creates obligations for the GM regarding information they must share when the players' characters observe the imagined location which corresponds to the game state token `VESTIBULE.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>In a another game, you've written in your prep, "100 GP are in the vestibule." No game state is created. No obligations are created. When the players' characters walk into the vestibule, maybe you'll say, "You see a hundred pieces of gold!" Or maybe you won't. No biggie! Both are valid. The notes in your prep, they were just ideas to get you going!                        </div>

                            It seems to me that seeing game rules as being a sort of "underlying code" of a video game is pretty much the same thing as seeing the rules as "the physics of the game world".

<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In fact, there's absolutely nothing that appears in both the imagined reality and in the game state!

I'd have to give this a good hard think before I say I agree with you unequivocally, but I'm very inclined to agree with you.  Point in fact a lot of early (I don't know the current state) Narrativist game design capitalized on this very idea.  There is nothing particularly controversial about your formulation which was nicely stated.<br/><br/>That these two layers, GameState and SIS, function using a completely different set of (ugh) symbols and operate at different levels of the abstract and the concrete is still not particularly controversial.  You might want to consider such things as Creative Agenda priorities and what not in the GameState.  It is an important part of play. <br/><br/>However they do constantly communicate with one another and are constrained by each other.  Nor does this GameState need to be physical.<br/><br/>My question to you is would you consider the bidding system of Dogs in The Vineyard to be functioning at the level of GameState?  Do you perhaps consider the following from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalis" rel="nofollow">Universalis</a> to be functioning at the GameState level?
<blockquote>Coins are the measure of story power in Universalis. By spending coins, players can create Facts in the game. These may be about characters, the setting, or the scene being played. Each player begins with a number of coins (typically 25), and gains more after each scene plays out (typically 5). Players may also gain coins by winning Complications</blockquote>
If you do then I'm not seeing anything new.  If I'm wrong, if you're willing, could you offer an example from DitV of a GameState?  I ask about Dogs because I'm loosely familiar with it having never played Universalis.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            I also wonder if Sandra agrees with your interpretation - my sense is that her "game state" was fairly analogous to (though not exactly the same as) the SIS. I'll be curious to hear what she has to say; as far as I remember, no one's really defined the term yet, anyway.                        </div>

<small>What's beautiful, <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a> ?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> , each player's coin count is part of the game state. But not a part of the game state that has any kind of interesting relationship to imagined events, since it works at a purely meta level. The rule that you can spend coins to state facts isn't part of state; any more than the rule that rooks move orthogonally and bishops move diagonally is part of the state of a game of chess. I don't have DitV, so I can't really comment on its details!</small><br/><br/>Ah, Paul, I understand the confusion!<br/><br/>That's really not what computer programs are like at all.<br/><br/>Programs are sequences of instructions, or actions. The game state is composed of propositions, or logical statements or descriptions.<br/><br/>Programs are executed; when executed, they <i>act</i>, manipulating a memory tape. The game state cannot <i>do</i> anything, merely be observed, talked about, and acted upon.<br/><br/>You might compare the game state to the memory tape that a program reads from and writes to. It's an extremely misleading analogy, the surface similarities will only confuse things. Primarily, <i>there is nothing that relates to the game state in the way that a program relates to a memory tape</i>.<br/><br/>And, <i>there is nothing that relates to a memory tape in the way that imagined events relate to the game state</i>.<br/><br/>Torturing the analogy to fix those misalignments is probably not a productive avenue.                        </div>

                            Ah, yes, I see what you mean. The System is our means of acting upon and changing both the imagined reality and the "game state", either of which <i>doesn't do anything on its own</i>.<br/><br/>Perhaps the board of a boardgame and its pieces might be a more suitable analogy, then. (Especially a boardgame that involves way to store information, like decks of cards, tokens used to track resources, and so forth.)<br/><br/>In that case, I see what you mean, although I don't think it's that different from my earlier "physics of the game world" analogy. It's not the laws of physics, maybe, but relevant values, like the mass of each object in the physics-analogy, its position and momentum, its density, and so forth. (In that analogy, the game state is the recorded values for such quantities, and the System is the flow of time. But it gets weird, because I think things like "the guards step outside at midnight each night" are closer to being values in the game state than elements of System.)<br/><br/>It's probably best to get away from twisted analogies, though, and talk about more practical matters: what does this mean for design, and how does it get us to new ideas or structures?                        </div>

                            Well yeah duh a boardgame and its pieces are the better analogy, that's why I've been talking about invisible chess for a week. To get people used to the idea that elfgames can have state in the same way that boardgames have state.<br/><br/>Here's a reason I don't like the "physical qualities of an imaginary world" analogy: the game state IS NOT an imaginary world, and the analogy makes it reaaaaaalllly easy to mistake surface similarity for structural alignment in a murky, confusing way.

                            That’s a good question. <br/><br/>Or does the answer, maybe, depend on that fact’s salience with regards to the game state? (For example, if falling prone affects what game actions your character can take or turns into attack penalties.)<br/><br/>Depending on the answer to that, this concept may have some serious limitations when it comes to more loose-knit systems (like the GM translating fictional position into advantage/disadvantage in D&amp;D).                        </div>

                            Very much no, actually.<br/><br/>The game state is not a symbolic representation of imagined events + some other stuff.<br/><br/>Say we're playing chess, and imagining it as a battle at the same time. My knight takes your queen. I say, "My knight knocks your queen off of her feet!"<br/><br/>We've got shared imagined events, here, right? I'm imagining it right now. You are too! Your queen is lying on the ground in the muck!<br/><br/>But the gamestate is exactly the positions of the chess pieces on the game board. It does not include (PRONE `THANUIRS_QUEEN).<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The gamestate can have any logical structure you want.<br/><br/>It's exactly those propositions required to enact the rules.<br/><br/>Portions of it can pretty much mirror imagined events. That doesn't mean imagined events are always mirrored in game state.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D5e, we have rules about opportunity attacks that require us to track whether characters are next to each other. That means that (ADJACENT `ALICE `BOB) is part of the game state. In The Pool, we don't, so it's not part of the game state.<br/><br/>The fact that (ADJACENT `ALICE `BOB) is part of the game state probably requires the GM to communicate that fact, per our system. But note that it's <i>not the same thing</i> as the GM having said "Bob is engaged in melee with Alice" and you and me each imagining Alice and Bob next to each other, fighting. It's <i>not the same thing</i> as the characters Alice and Bob being next to each other in imagined events, in the shared imagined space.<br/><br/>Any more than my Queen being at E6 and your Rook being at E5 is the same thing as us looking at the chess board and imagining my Queen and your Rook next to each other, fighting. Those are the positions, whether we look at the board or not, whether we imagine them fighting or not.                        </div>

Note that this is what was done at the Forge.<br/><br/>See also Dogma 99 and Turku school manifestos.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with finding a new way of looking at roleplaying to legitimize a style of play.

                            Wow, there are twenty new posts in my favorite thread!<br/><br/>I’m gonna address Jeph first using our special nerd lingo and then I’ll get into your points, Paul and Jay, OK?<br/><br/>I’m gonna start off by clarifying my own take on the “is the game state wholly symbolic vs a virtual world” thing. Now, I really don’t want to create a rift between myself and Jeph because wherever he is going “[Next]” I’m gonna go too, I think! I need someone who groks lisp on the other side… <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/>

It <i>is not identical to</i> the imagined events. It <i>is not</i> a virtual world where those events take place.</p></div></blockquote>Right; it’s the data-structure that in turn constructs the virtual world.<br/><br/>Like how in the Deleuze sense, the window on the computer screen is virtual, there’s a middle layer of coordinate arrays and graphics routines, and down on the metal it’s all magnets and electricity.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Well yeah duh a boardgame and its pieces are the better analogy, that’s why I’ve been talking about invisible chess for a week. To get people used to the idea that elfgames can have state in the same way that boardgames have state.<br/><br/>Here’s a reason I don’t like the “physical qualities of an imaginary world” analogy: the game state IS NOT an imaginary world, and the analogy makes it reaaaaaalllly easy to mistake surface similarity for structural alignment in a murky, confusing way. Best avoid.</p></div></blockquote>I disagree; the benefits of the analogy are much too great to give up. Here’s why:<br/><br/>I think the view of <del>our diegesis</del> (edit a month later) our mimesis, our blorb, as a “world”, having it expressed “in natural language” (or even imagined, fully realized 3d places and people) rather than sexps (symbolic expressions) is <strong>sometimes</strong> a great tool for us humans to use when remembering parts the game state because of how <em>any</em> aspect of established wallpaper (whether improvised wallpaper, or gloracularly produced wallpaper) can <em>become</em> salient. (Obviously salient elements have an unambigous sexp representation.)<br/><br/>As ambitious as some sexp representations are:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Norvig PAIP p 131" rel="nofollow">Norvig PAIP p 131</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><code>(gps '(son-at-home car-needs-battery have-money have-phone-book) ' (son-at-school))</code></p></div></blockquote>You run into the “lack of descriptive power” problem, p 144 on the same book.<br/><br/>Like, what we can do in D&amp;D, and why it’s my favorite game of all time, are these transitions between wallpaper and saliency, and taking advantage of the human brain’s amazing pattern recognition power.<br/><br/><img alt="Selfie Preservation" src="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=439508&amp;type=card"/><br/><br/><em>If there’s a tree in its art</em>…<br/><br/>This was an paradigm-shattering card.<br/><br/>Suddenly everyone had to go through their collections of basic land cards and add a completely new salient predicate to their estimation of each card, <code>has-tree-in-art-p</code>.<br/><br/>Ultimately, my view is that the most efficient way to store the game state, <strong>because</strong> we have the advantage of a <em>human brain</em> to interpret it, is as as a big old <em>mish-mash</em>, a big gloppy ball of mud of a <strong>mix</strong> of languages. It’s like those old Infocom boxes… this is a picture, this is a map, this is a tape recording, this is a keychain, this is z-code binary data derived from sexps, this is a little folder with the history of the town…<br/><br/>This is my vivid, “natlang” or spatial memory of the time Alice almost got sucked into the death propeller, this is my prep with a couple of sexps for each room, etc.<br/><br/>FATE was groundbreaking in <em>storing free strings</em> as data, but ultimately faltered, by not being able to parse/eval those strings, instead treating them as just all equal, just meaningless binary blobs of text; i.e. they got <em>treated</em> mostly as symbols (interned strings) even though they <em>looked</em> as if they had parsable, usable semantic content.<br/><br/>We don’t have to make that same mistake.<br/><br/>I sure as heckfire use sexps (using quasiquotation to store both symbols and procedures in the same cons tree) to prep, they’re great both for prepping very widely <em>and</em> when prepping deeply. But it’s just a tool. I’m just as likely to use a photograph or a detailed Mike Schley map or some prose text.<br/><br/>Uh, I get that you were using sexps <em>as a metaphor</em> just like you were using the air chess earlier.<br/><br/>And I’m in agreement.<br/><br/>I’m just adding to that by saying that a vividly imagined “world” <em>is</em> still useful as a very practical way to store <em>some</em> of the “off-screen canon game-state” / diegesis / MIS. And in the Deleuze-sense, then, the entire game-state (both the parts of it <em>actively</em> imagined / formed-in-the-mind as world, and the parts of it stored symbolically) does form a “virtual world”.<br/><br/>So to give my answer Thanuir’s question to Jeph:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Jeph, suppose I am playing game which does not have formal rules for someone having fallen down or being prone. My character falls down. Is the statement indicating that my character is prone a part of the gamestate, as you see it?<br/><br/>(I am guessing yes, but I want to verify.)</p></div></blockquote>In 2097e, <em>yes</em>. While we <strong>do</strong> happen to have formal rules for prone, let’s say instead “turned 20 degrees slightly to the right, looking up at the stirge flying down at your face”, and that <em>is</em> a part of our gamestate.<br/><br/> </div>

Ooh. Yeah. You have convinced me!<br/><br/>Like, I draw a LOT of maps, which my games hold as gamestate-ful. The gamestate is probably exactly that image of the map.

<blockquote>In 2097e, yes. While we do happen to have formal rules for prone, let’s say instead “turned 20 degrees slightly to the right, looking up at the stirge flying down at your face”, and that is a part of our gamestate.</blockquote>
Hmm, I'm not sure I really understand this.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure you'd agree that in The Pool or Universalis, "turned 20 degrees slightly to the right, looking up..." is NOT part of the game state.<br/><br/>What about 2097e makes it so that it IS part of the game state?<br/><br/>Is it part of the game state in your average Apoc Wolrd game?

I can’t for the life of me see how these are contradictory or different. These are both just descriptions of how the existence of the secret door was added to the SIS. In both cases the B-C-B Principle definition of “system” seems to apply. The DM is referencing their prep and using that information to add a fact into the Shared Imaginary Space.<br/><br/>In both cases, “the secret door is in that wall”, because at some point the DM decided to either put it there earlier during prep or decide that they would use this part of the module that says the door’s there without modification.<br/><br/>As far as I can see, consulting the Game State is just a tool used in a particular type of System (defined in the B-C-B-Principal as “how we decide what happens in the SIS”), no different than dice, negotiation, consulting a chart, submitting to a particular player’s narrative authority, etc.<br/><br/>The fact that we’re considering the “Game State” as an extra-SIS “virtual world” that all the players to have agreed to abide by (the same as they’ve all agreed to abide by the results of dice rolls) doesn’t make it not part of the System or invalidate the (I’m just calling it this from now on because it’s easier to type) Lumpley Principle.<br/><br/>Or not?

<a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash">@Neurotrash</a>, I think that’s precisely the same question a bunch of us keep asking. Right there with you!<br/><br/>The first entry from the bit you quoted sounds like an accurate description of how RPG play works.<br/><br/>The second is either a metaphor (in which case it’s the same thing, expressed in less clear language), or it’s... something else I can’t parse, since that sentence appears to be conflating fantasy and reality.                        </div>

                            It... sounds like mostly everyone is on the same page here?<br/><br/>In some games, there exists a Game State, some sort of objective logical structure; and the system creates obligations related to that Game State, and uses the Game State to constrain what counts as a valid contribution to the SIS.<br/><br/>Right? We all agree on that?<br/><br/>I don't think that the no-myth view or blorb view are contradictory in the <i>facts</i>, they're contradictory in terms of what's important, worth paying attention to and spending energy on.<br/><br/>No Myth holds the game state as essentially ephemeral and unimportant. It ONLY matters insofar as it affects contributions to the SIS.<br/><br/>Blorb holds that this is overly dismissive, the game state is a first-class structure just as important as the SIS.                        </div>

                            Okay, I think I agree then.<br/><br/>It's more of a matter of agenda/priority than a description about what is happening in the game.<br/><br/>If anything, this thread has convinced me that such a thing as the Game State exists. I might have argued against that fact before...<br/><br/>So that still brings up the question of what one can do with this realization when it comes to a design standpoint. Other than including ways prep and use blorb (and declare that a facet of the system will be a strict adherence to that blorb and its effect on the Game State), how can this help us create procedures that will better allow players and groups who prioritize manipulation and tracking of the Game State as their primary goal in achieving that goal in play?<br/><br/>More over, I think it might end up turning us back to the original debate on this thread, which is whether it is a bad idea to design a game wherein both interacting with the Game State and creating an SIS together are simultaneous and equally important goals, and whether its possible/desirable/coherent to attempt a design where players who prioritize one over the other can both be equally accommodated...<br/><br/>...and whether system tools that enable one type of play (Game State Manipulation) intrinsically inhibits the other type of play (SIS Construction), which I believe was 2097's original claim.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

No! Fake news! Go back and re-read that post more carefully please:<br/><br/>Earlier I wrote that whether or not the game state includes (CONTAINS `VESTIBULE (GP 100)) <b>depends on the game</b>. That proposition is in the game state if and only if we have system related to that proposition.<br/><br/>For instance, if we've agreed that the GM must say what their prep demands.<br/><br/>In <b>exactly the same way</b>, being prone is in the game state if and only if we have system related to being prone.<br/></div></blockquote>
Thanks. How does this work with OSR-style play with rulings over rules, where the precise mechanical interpretation of someone being prone is uncertain before the situation happens, and then the referee or the group as a whole makes a ruling about if and how the condition matters in this particular circumstance?<br/><br/>I think this is essentially the same question as you got to in the quote of Sandra, in the last paragraphs of your post.<br/><br/>I think a related phenomenon is that anything in the fiction (allow the sloppy language) might become relevant; there is a Lamentations adventure where the eye colour of characters might matter and a Trilemma adventure where blue clothes are relevant, to take examples where actual colour becomes a substantial part of play. Likewise Sandra's tar example.<br/><br/>I would be very tempted to say that the entire fiction is part of the game state in these kinds of games, but you clearly have something more limited in mind.<br/><br/>I think a relevant difference between this kind of game and Universalis or D&amp;D 4 might be that OSR play* (and, I guess, Sandra's play) is one of creative problem solving, in the sense that one has limited tools that one tries to use in clever ways to solve problems, and the culture of play respects interesting and exotic problems and solutions.<br/><br/>If one has narrative authority, then problem solving is of entirely different nature; I think Rickhard has some game like Dungeons and Bananas for this. But I might misremember a name or two.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 4, by default, has a component of tactical miniature problem solving (an important or an incidental one), while the focus might be elsewhere, but could also be in the tactical mini-game. I understand that Eero's game also has a light strategic dimension, but is focused more on following the stories of the characters and on enjoying the game world.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>* By OSR play, I mean the style of play that is fairly typical in OSR circles and rare elsewhere.

Yeah, I think it's the same question.<br/><br/>My current thinking is that this sort of thing is operating directly on the imagined events, and not the game state. I'm not sure whether I'm being sloppy or ill-posed in this regard.<br/><br/>But to clarify something: I am <b>not saying</b> that anything that serves as the operand for a rule is part of the game state. More like, if the rules cannot be enacted based on the SIS alone, then the game state is that minimal additional logical structure that you need.<br/><br/>So when Dungeon World's Hack and Slash move writes "When you attack an enemy in melee..." that doesn't mean we need to include the relation <code>IN_MELEE</code> in our game state. Because we can resolve that purely at the SIS level.<br/><br/>But now consider D&amp;D5e, even a completely Theater of the Mind 5e with no grid. There's a rule that when you leave an enemy's reach, they get an opportunity attack. Consider a situation where the DM knows that an invisible assassin is standing next to Alice. Nothing about this assassin has been shared. But <code>(WITHIN_REACH `ASSASSIN `ALICE)</code> has to be in the game state, because we can't enact the opportunity attack rule without it.<br/><br/>I'm kinda musing out loud and clarifying my own thinking at the moment, rather than trying to Teach Something.                        </div>

                            Nope, no difference at all, because we still need to know that Alice was within reach of the invisible assassin, and we can't know that from the SIS!<br/><br/>EDIT: Unless we're explicitly allowing the GM to inject invisible assassins wherever and whenever they wish, I guess? "Uh, and there's an, uh, invisible assassin right behind you, and they get an opportunity attack as you enter the grocery store to buy arugula and baby kale!" Probably not a game I want to play. Or unless this is a Player Move, in which case it doesn't apply the invisible assassin, and probably really does only trigger off of the SIS, unless this is a really funky cool game that involves players having hidden game state that they know about and the GM doesn't.<br/><br/>Oh, hey, we just opened up some design space: Game state that the player knows about and the GM doesn't.                        </div>

But not a part of the game state that has any kind of interesting relationship to imagined events, since it works at a purely meta level. The rule that you can spend coins to state facts isn't part of state; any more than the rule that rooks move orthogonally and bishops move diagonally is part of the state of a game of chess. I don't have DitV, so I can't really comment on its details!</p></div></blockquote>
Thank you for clarifying that for me.  Appreciate it!<br/><br/>I'm trying to work this though so indulge me, if you will, with the Chess Board analogy.
<blockquote>Things that are in the diegesis, imagined events, do not necessarily have any correspondence with anything in the game state. The game state is not "imagined events plus some other stuff." It's not even "A portion of imagined events, plus maybe other stuff."<br/><br/>It's a set of propositions: predicates which operate on tokens, logical primitives like numbers and booleans, and other propositions.</blockquote>
I propose that the chess board with the chess pieces on it, in the various positions are analogous to the SIS or what I sometimes refer to as the "fact space."  It is the arena where the <i>act of playing</i> takes place.  Going a bit further let say we end with a White Queen moved to the same file as the Black King and there are no other pieces between the two.<br/><br/>The SIS has nothing to say about the relationship of the pieces, they just are where they are.<br/><br/>The GameSpace does focus on the relationship of pieces, uses the rules of the game and draws a conclusion (makes a judgement) - one element of the GameState is that the "King is in Check."  The rules say that you must inform your opponent about this (typically this spoken but for the sake of this example perhaps a token is put on the side board or placard is flipped over with the word "Check" exposed under it) but they also say that your opponent must address this GameState of Check above all other GameStates concerns.  I would also offer that the Chess Clock is also part of the GameState in competition chess.  If a player runs out of time is equivalent to running out of HP's.  In both cases a new GameState condition is created.  In the first that state is "You lose" it an RPG depending on CA and rules it could be "You lose" (als Kobolds Ate My Baby) or "Your character is dead" or "Your character loses consciousness" or "You lose the Conflict take fall out."<br/><br/>So the SIS/"fact space" is completely agnostic WRT such matters a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proposed/considered/planned moves</span>, strategy, board state, winning, losing, offense, defense or any other matter requiring human judgment.  The "game" of chess begins and ends with the chessboard and the disposition of the pieces (one is not playing if they are not moving chess pieces - this is more solidly clarified in tournament chess with the Chess Clock).  For all that cogitation that happens in the GameState play isn't happening until the pieces are moved.<br/><br/>The SIS is the official IS.<br/>That GameState covers everything about what the SIS signifies.<br/><br/>The chessboard can exist without the GameState but play can't happen as there is no Agency.  The GameState can only exist because of its relationship to the specific chessboard.  The GameState state can be both informed by the SIS and inform what can be done in the SIS.<br/><br/>Its interesting to examine this GameState as that what really matters to us as players happens in this part of the game.  Such things as nebulous as CA make their influence felt here but this space has never been described or given a name before.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Oof. I want to nip this in the bud!<br/><br/>Chess is a game that really, truly, actually has a game state.<br/><br/>The game state is the positions of the pieces on the board. <small>(The physical board and pieces are not the game state. They're signifiers, signs, which help us remember and track the game state. You don't need the physical board and pieces to play chess; you can track the game state in your head, if you want.)</small><br/><br/>That's not a metaphor. The positions of the pieces on the board is <i>literally the game state</i> of a game of chess.<br/><br/>Please, pleas, please, please do not construct some analogy where the positions of the pieces on the board in chess maps to something other than game state. That will become ridiculously confusing.<br/><br/>Chess has no SIS.<br/><br/>But we can play a version of chess that does have a SIS. Call in Vivid Imagination Chess. We imagine a battle where sixteen warriors dressed in red face off against sixteen warriors dressed in white, each corresponding to one of the pieces in the game state. After making a move, you describe it in the battle.<br/><br/>"Pawn to C3. Gallant Sir Pawnington martches forth, his cloak billowing, shield raised, the tip of his spear tied with a fluttering banner of red cloth!"                        </div>

<i>That was exactly the point of my analogy!</i>  And your phrasing maps exactly to my ideas of the differences between the SIS and the GameState.<br/><br/>To me what you described in the quote above is crystal clear but if I'm the only one who benefits from the analogy then it is, ofcourse, not useful.  I liked it specifically because the actual pieces are signifiers (the SIS/the fact space/the concrete) which help us remember and track the game state (with all its functioning at the abstract level). I will, with much sadness <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> cease using it.  It's all good!<br/><br/>I would suggest, if you find it ameniable, that in using the virtual/air chess analogy that in order to keep the conversation as "simple" as possible that we stick to "Pawn to C3" type of statement just for the duration of this analogy. Statements like, "The Gallant Sir Pawnington marches forth, his cloak billowing, shield raised, the tip of his spear tied with a fluttering banner of red cloth!" are mostly Color but can add elements that can confuse the analogy.  Maybe I'm not that bright but I want to distill this GameState idea down to its very base essentials before working back up to implications and design considerations.<br/><br/>Aside from my poor use of the idea of a physical chessboard do you have any comments on the ideas offered in my previous post?  Understanding that the like you said the SIS is the arena of referents and referents modified by which we keep by which keep track of GameState.  The GameState being that arena where we interpret the referents, make choices, do book keeping, etc. and which under the proper circumstances we then go back and make modifications to the arena of referents/SIS.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Yeah, I think we're pretty much on the same page then!<br/><br/>Though I'm not sure what I think about SIS as the arena of referents. Sandra would say that the referent is the symbol in the Game State, I think; the symbol in the game state is the causal antecedent of the imagined entity in the SIS, just like the planet Venus is the causal antecedent of the entity I think of when I say "The Evening Star."<br/><br/>And note, the Vivid Imagination Chess thing isn't an analogy. It's an actual game we can play right now, where the Game State is the logical structure signified by the board and pieces, and the SIS is what's evoked in our minds when I talk about Gallant Sir Pawnington, and when we look at the board and imagine the ranks of our soldiers on the field.                        </div>

Certainly going to very different direction than Sandra is, given her suggestion that "who knows what" is of relatively little importance.<br/><br/>If the game state is the minimal additional logical structure needed in addition to SIS, then it behaves strangely: As a greater deal of the fiction is revealed, it shrinks in size. In particular, if we take chess and start imagining the fiction and sharing it, the game state diminishes, and if we manage to add the entire game state (the locations of pieces, has castling been invalidated by moving the pieces, how many repeated moves there have been; let us ignore clocks for simplicity) to the shared imagined space, than the game state vanishes.<br/><br/>The suggested concept would be more useful in a game of hidden information, for sure.<br/><br/>What would be the price to pay for saying that anything that serves as an operand to the game rules is a part of the game state?                        </div>

                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> or <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a>,<br/><br/>Being the village idiot that I am would either of you please define or make clearer for dummies like me what "operand to the game rules" means.<br/><br/>My take is that the concepts you employed in your example - 
<blockquote>...the locations of pieces, has castling been invalidated by moving the pieces, how many repeated moves there have been...</blockquote>
- are all GameState items.  The tricky one is the "location of the pieces".  In this particular circumstance this is where the SIS and the GameState come into contact.  The facts of the SIS informing the GameState.  Which in due course the GameState will then generate a proposition about the "location of the pieces" that travels through the LBCB Principle and possibly updates the SIS.  To me the SIS is nothing but facts.  Like your castling example that concept only resides in the GameState.  It is informed by what the players communicate into the SIS but the SIS itself is utterly agnotic WRT concepts.<br/><br/>The idea of the GameState vanishing is an idea that I'm having a terrible time wrapping my head around.  My conceptions about my character, my conceptions about Situation, the various courses of action that I'm conceptualizing definitionally belong in the GameState and can never go away while one is play<i>ing</i>.  For the GameState to "vanish" would be akin the the player utterly losing all knowledge of the game itself.  I am willing to admit that perhaps that my understanding is incorrect and any enlightenment would be gladly accepted.
<blockquote> ...very different direction than Sandra is, given her suggestion that "who knows what" is of relatively little importance.</blockquote>
I'm completely at sea by this statement.  What information does "who knows what" refer to?  The SIS?  The GameSpace?  The separation of GM and player knowledge?  Help?!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            The SIS is a <em>strict</em> subset of the MIS / the game-state / the blorb.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What about 2097e makes it so that it <em>[“turned 20 degrees slightly to the right, looking up…”]</em> IS part of the game state?</p></div></blockquote>In 2097e actions can be wholly diegetic (finchian) and they can sometimes lead into engaging a dice-level mechanic (from tonight’s session: “I drink the tea” “Make a DC 12 con save”); I call this the “braid”; diegetic→dice→diegetic→dice.<br/><br/>Diegetic actions depend on previous description. “Then I look at the other side” is different if it follows “I look at the left side first” vs “I look at the right side first”.

Engaging is fine but be specific.<br/><br/>Also I just saw that I’ve been using the word Ephemera wrong. Guh, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23english&amp;Mode=like">#english</a>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The fact that we’re considering the “Game State” as an extra-SIS “virtual world” that all the players to have agreed to abide by (the same as they’ve all agreed to abide by the results of dice rolls) doesn’t make it not part of the System or invalidate the (I’m just calling it this from now on because it’s easier to type) Lumpley Principle.</p></div></blockquote>In Swedish we have an expression.<br/><br/>Don’t go cross the river to fetch water.<br/><br/>Instead of going all the way out to this extra-SIS (the MIS) to validate all your SIS operations,<br/>you can operate directly on the MIS since it is a strict superset of the SIS, just with a <code>shared-p</code> flippable bit.<br/><br/>If the LBCBP view would hold <em>strictly</em>, yes, the MIS could still be implemented, but only monadically as part of operations that are primarily SIS operations (each operation would have it’s own “relationship” to the MIS). Which is crossing an entire ocean just to fetch some water. Also, such a game doesn’t exist.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Blorb holds that this is overly dismissive, the game state is a first-class structure just as important as the SIS.</p></div></blockquote>It’s strictly more important than the SIS.

Other than including ways prep and use blorb (and declare that a facet of the system will be a strict adherence to that blorb and its effect on the Game State), how can this help us create procedures that will better allow players and groups who prioritize manipulation and tracking of the Game State as their primary goal in achieving that goal in play?</p></div></blockquote>Right; making rules about when and how to add things into the Game State is something that is very uncodified and ad-hoc right now. I’ve tried to get the ball rolling with stuff like “No Paper after seeing Rock” or whatever but we can have much finer granularity.<br/><br/>Also creating things that give gloracular answers about off-screen actions in the Game State. An example of such a design being the faction turn in SWN.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>More over, I think it might end up turning us back to the original debate on this thread, which is whether it is a bad idea to design a game wherein both interacting with the Game State and creating an SIS together are simultaneous and equally important goals, and whether its possible/desirable/coherent to attempt a design where players who prioritize one over the other can both be equally accommodated…<br/><br/>…and whether system tools that enable one type of play (Game State Manipulation) intrinsically inhibits the other type of play (SIS Construction), which I believe was 2097’s original claim.</p></div></blockquote>Right…<br/><br/>in our model <code>shared-p</code> is a flippable bit, a predicate applied to entities, in their model it’s the fundamental building block of the universe. “Uttering is making.”

Maybe because I have a larp background, when there are dozens of players and you can’t keep track of everything anyway. Here is perhaps the clearest example:<br/><br/>When playing in a D&amp;D game in 2014, I wasn’t the DM, I was player. I wrote something on a note and sealed it in an envelope without showing it to the DM.<br/><br/>It said I cast <a href="https://open5e.com/spellcasting/spells_a-z/p/purify-food-and-drink.html" rel="nofollow">“Purify Food and Drink”</a> spell on the food that was served to the duchess.<br/><br/>That’s just one of many examples.<br/><br/>Often it’s drama level stuff like building relationships etc.<br/><br/> </div>

We meant<br/>Some parts of the game state (the game state includes things like swords and green dragons and cakes) are also part of the SIS. When two or more people know about something, that means it's part of the SIS.<br/><br/>In my model, making something that's in the game state <b>known</b> isn't a radical change to that thing. You had the cake. You still have the cake, only now it's a cake that people know about.<br/><br/>In the "no myth" worldview, you didn't have the cake before.

                            It seems to me that the permanent game state is in fact an extension of the rules. It is a rule that in this room of the dungeon, there are three caskets behind a pit; you can't break that rule anymore than when I play, oh, Apocalypse World that you can roll with Hard when you make the Act Under Fire move. Of course, maybe you have a move that lets you do just that: rules modifying rules, and we have rules for that. Just so that if I have the cantrip <i>mage hand</i> and need to do something inside a closed casket, and there are no rules saying I can't, then I can do it and we check the rules (the prep/module) for what happens next.<br/><br/>The argument on the 2097e side at first seems to be that <i>only</i> things that have rules are real: die Regeln sind allen was der Fall ist.* This follows the, uh, lemme use "Laws" here to avoid confusion, the Laws of Salience and Tiers of Truth.<br/><br/>Basically: Facts are rules. Certainly the inverse is true: it is a fact that your character can't fly in D&amp;D without spell/magic/wings, it is a fact in Masks that the Outsider <i>can</i>. Those are both rules. New facts about the world are new rules, constraining it or expanding it.<br/><br/>And actually...that's true for Apocalypse World too, it's just that in Apocalypse World we basically have a rule that's like "whatever a player asserts about their character/the world in their reach, that is not contradicted by prior events (where <i>facts</i> are <i>rules</i> or existing rules (<i>rules</i> are <i>facts</i>) is true." (Note that the rule is constrained, of course, because Apocalypse World says that players can't just assert that "there's a robot empire to the east" unless prompted by the MC, who will remain the ultimate arbiter of that truth through their function as, in truth, the prompter of questions about the game state which allows more assertion of new facts/rules.)<br/><br/>Other games allow players to assert that there's a robot empire in the east because that's in the rules for them.<br/><br/>Now at least part of the assertion here is that by prioritizing prewritten rules (the module/prep) and creating clear and essentially immutable rules for the generation of new rules/facts, you get a different experience than games that allow you to make up rules on the spot, or at least more freely. That in AW it is a rule that whatever someone makes up in response to a game question is as true as prep or rules. But it's a case of AWs procedures being different, ultimately; AW has rules about how to generate new rules, just like 2097e. But as to whether the experience is different, well, duh, of course it is because the point is that the different rules systems generate different experiences. <i>That is the point of different rule systems</i>. <br/><br/>Note that the rules propositions of 2097e do in fact require the procedures Sandra has created, because in such a system the GM is limited just as the players are: the rules are all that the world is, and the GM is given no leeway to alter the world-state (the rules) beyond what has been allowed or what the system instructs us in how to create. But you know, so does Apocalypse World. It's just the tolerances are different and they aim at different experiences: but you can maybe see that the main differences is "how much of the world/rulestate is encoded at the beginning" and also the procedures for generating new rules.<br/><br/>As to the central question of the thread, I'll leave it to people who know theory rather than this simple big-city girl who mostly just likes to run games. It does seem to me that analyzing rules and procedures in terms of how they alter the rulestate may help us see which principles work better for which type of experience. Furthermore, deciding just what the heck "experience" means and the typology of what they look like I leave to smarter people like Sandra who you know created a whole canonical theory of it including friendship bonds. I mean, you could make AW style playbooks out of it; it states things well. Looking at places where experiences and expectations blend may show where blended rulestate systems might be acceptable; examining the furthest ends of the spectrums will help determine maybe what those principles look like. And you know, Sandra did that in this thread, I think?** Except for maybe hating on Lady Blackbird, but that's like Glenn Gould hating on Mozart, which never kept Gould from being a freaking genius <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> <br/><br/><br/>*The Laws of Saliency further follow the principle "wovon man nicht regieren kann, darüber müssen die Regeln schweigen" in the Wallpaper principle.<br/><br/>**I got my MA in Literary Theory and walked away without a look back, save my post-two-beers rants about how Bakhtin can be used to expose the fundamental generic flaw in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.                        </div>

<small>(I think ya'll are successfully convincing me that "game state is all the operands of the rules" is a more useful concept than "the minimal additional logical structure beyond the SIS".)</small><br/><br/>My own personal takeaways from these 600 posts, plus a few hundred others in various related threads:
<ol>
<li>Games have Game State beyond the Shared Imagined Space: all the concepts and relations needed to enact the game's rules.</li>
<li>The Philosophy of Blorb holds the Game State outside of the Shared Imagined Space is of first-class importance. That it is useful, desirable, and productive to engage the un-shared State in both play and design.</li>

<blockquote><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> said:<br/><br/>In Swedish we have an expression.<br/><br/>Don’t go cross the river to fetch water.<br/><br/>Instead of going all the way out to this extra-SIS (the MIS) to validate all your SIS operations, you can operate directly on the MIS since it is a strict superset of the SIS, just with a shared-p flippable bit.<br/></blockquote>
I've read this several times and still have trouble understanding what you're saying.<br/><br/>Can you give an example of "going to the MIS to validate your SIS operations"?<br/><br/>Can you give an example of "operating directly on the MIS"? And how it's different than the above?<br/><br/>Can you explain the "shared-p flippable" bit?<br/><br/>What I think you're trying to say is instead of consulting the GameState to see what does or does not get added to the SIS, you should just think of it as interacting with the GameState directly. But that's never what is happening when you are actually engaged in playing an rpg.<br/><br/>As I understand it, interacting directly with the GameState would be something like marking off hitpoints. If there's a rule that says, "When a character is at zero HP, the character dies," and the DM sees your HP count, makes that translation to fiction, and announces, "You're at zero HP. You're character is dead." Your character is now dead in the SIS.<br/><br/>But the character didn't die in the SIS until the DM consulted the GameState (the character sheet says "zero HP") and translated it into fiction, then communicated that fiction (via speech or holding up the sheet for everyone to see, it doesn't matter what form the communication takes) to the players.
<blockquote>In my model, making something that's in the game state known isn't a radical change to that thing. You had the cake. You still have the cake, only now it's a cake that people know about.</blockquote>
But you're still consulting the GameState in order to decide what's allowed in the SIS in that case. <br/><br/>I see no difference between:<br/><br/> "The cake was part of the gamestate and wasn't known about, but then I told you about it so it's part of the SIS"<br/><br/>and <br/><br/>"We wanted to add [what was in the fridge] to the SIS, so the DM consulted the GameState and told us [what was in the fridge], and thus it was added.<br/><br/>How are they different, other than one is from the point of view of the DM and the other is from the POV of the players?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

There is a motive in the second one, but not the first one. The first one should have a motive like "We wanted to know what was in the fridge...".<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>There are two approaches to game design here.<br/><br/>If you take the approach that mostly the shared imagined space matters, then you are more likely to design games with shared narration, or with Apocalypse world -style triggered moves.<br/>You can still have a game with unknown established facts; in Apocalypse world, you still draw maps (even if they have blanks) and respect the preparation and so on.<br/><br/>If you take the approach that the game state is what matters the most, including the non-shared parts, then it is inconvenient to design games with widely shared narration because everyone with narrational authority has to respect the fiction, and this is more challenging to accomplish. (Go ahead and prove me wrong by design.)<br/>You are more likely to design fictional content, rather than only procedures: consider how useful an adventure is in D&amp;D when compared to Primetime adventures, to take an extreme example.<br/><br/>A definite game state is more useful if you want to design a game where the players solve a mystery or a puzzle, or reveal a secret. The focus on shared imagined space is more fruitful if you want a game where the players create a mystery. The shared imagined space approach is more fruitful, in the short run, if you want the play to create a particular kind of story, or even a particular story, though in the long run you might notice that you have painted yourself into a corner.<br/><br/>This is not to say that you could not achieve any of the stated goals with either design approach; I am only saying that some are more natural for a particular approach.                        </div>

<div class="Message">
<a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a>, thank you for that very satisfying summary!
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What I think you’re trying to say is instead of consulting the GameState to see what does or does not get added to the SIS, you should just think of it as interacting with the GameState directly.</p></div></blockquote>Yes, that’s how you should think of it, that’s the takeaway. Here’s an example of that happening:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>“We wanted to add [what was in the fridge] to the SIS, so the DM consulted the GameState and told us [what was in the fridge], and thus it was added.</p></div></blockquote>That’s right. There was something in the fridge that was unknown to us. By us finding out what that thing was, one thing changed about it: it is now known to us. It has been <code>shared-p</code>.<br/><br/>That’s our model.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But that’s never what is happening when you are actually engaged in playing an rpg.</p></div></blockquote>Did you see the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485674/#Comment_485674" rel="nofollow">post about the difference between make-believe “let’s pretend that the floor is lava” and yarn-spinning “this is a story about a family of birds who live in a forest. who is their friend?”</a>.<br/><br/>Some games (never “traditional techniques” games of any complexity, not even AW, but some shorter very hippiefied li’l story-games) have an <em>apparent</em> rule set that truly are implemented solely on the yarn-spinning level. They’re phrased as partipipants make statement according to a set of criteria on those statements. But even these games, the way they <em>work</em>, what makes them <em>fly</em>, is that the participants start constructing this big old world in their heads which helps them to remember things, to reincorporate things, and most of all: helps them to <em>care</em> about things.<br/><br/>For the “no myth” stuff to be true, they’d instead see it as “There was nothing in the fridge until we opened it. Then the DM looked at her prep, saw that it had <code>'(fridge (container shelves cake electricity))</code>, consulted the rule about examining <code>container-p</code> items, and <strong>created</strong> a cake <strong>by</strong> adding it to the the SIS.”<br/><br/>That model, because of Turing completeness, can also create the same outcomes as our model <strong>but it’s utterly cumbersome</strong>.<br/><br/>The “closet language theorem” variant of the model made a bolder &amp; wronger claim and with that model, the only type of fridge/gameplay that would be allowed is “There was nothing in the fridge until we opened it. The GM had a 100% blank mind. Heard that we opened a fridge and tried to make up something that would be good to be stored in a fridge. She came up with a cake.” Because as soon as you have <em>any</em> inkling of what type of imagined cakes or whatever are in there, you are creating referents. So the “closet language theorem” applies to pretty much no game ever.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As I understand it, interacting directly with the GameState would be something like marking off hitpoints.</p></div></blockquote>That’s right.<br/><br/>Here are some ways to interact directly with the game state:
<ul><li>moving from room to room in the dungeon</li><li>opening chests</li><li>chopping each other with swords</li><li>marking off hitpoints</li><li>dying</li></ul> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If there’s a rule that says, “When a character is at zero HP, the character dies,” and the DM sees your HP count, makes that translation to fiction, and announces, “You’re at zero HP. You’re character is dead.” Your character is now dead in the SIS.</p></div></blockquote><small>More likely it’d be the <em>player</em> saying that to the DM rather than the other way around but that’s a minor nitpic</small><br/><br/>That’s right. The character was dead as soon as that HP reached 0. And by announcing it, the <code>shared-p</code> bit on that death is flipped. Which is of some relevance, but not as momentously fundamental as it would’ve been with the no-myth model.<br/><br/>Here’s another story. The character dies in the gamestate but only one person at the table, that character’s player, knows about it yet, so according to the whole LBCBP stuff it hasn’t been added to the SIS. The player sits in shock, dumbfounded. The rest of the party goes into the next room. “Alice”, Bob says, “aren’t you coming with?” “I’m <strong>dead</strong>, you blockhead!” Alice says. Now it’s added to the SIS. The whole “adding to the SIS” part wasn’t <i>un</i>important but the death itself was the thing.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But you’re still consulting the GameState in order to decide what’s allowed in the SIS in that case.</p></div></blockquote>Which is utterly cumbersome.
<dl><dt>Operating on the SIS but consulting the game state</dt><dd>“I need to create what’s in the fridge. I’ll look at the game state to see what I have to create.”</dd><dt>Operating on the game state directly</dt><dd>“There’s a cake in this fridge. I’ll tell them about it.”</dd></dl>The SIS is like the computer screen. A game designed strictly according to LBCBP principles would like designing a game where all the code resides in, or is called by, the screen drawing routines. That’s just bad design. Also no such game exists if it has the slightest bit of traditional techniques. I called AW a disciplined design in the other thread but then I remembered that you also need “players” who have “characters” and those characters’ gear sure as heckfire isn’t defined solely in the “screen drawing routines”; they are stand alone objects. Although Dungeon World comes close with its “adventuring gear” rule on 328. Which… isn’t that rule kind of unsatsifying and pointless? It wholly de-tangibilitifies the sensation of having gear.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Note that the rules propositions of 2097e do in fact require the procedures Sandra has created, because in such a system the GM is limited just as the players are: the rules are all that the world is, and the GM is given no leeway to alter the world-state (the rules) beyond what has been allowed or what the system instructs us in how to create.</p></div></blockquote>That’s right. <a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> played with our group for the first time yesterday and got to see our game: a pale, flickering, kinda crappy cave-wall shadow cast by the blazing blorb ideal.<br/><br/>Including a mistake correction! I had forgotten that the players had destroyed a trapped statue when they visited a room previously.<br/><br/>And, a “mirror story”! I got salty af when one of the deadliest traps of all time was utterly defanged by a cantrip <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But you know, so does Apocalypse World. It’s just the tolerances are different and they aim at different experiences: but you can maybe see that the main differences is “how much of the world/rulestate is encoded at the beginning” and also the procedures for generating new rules.</p></div></blockquote>Yes.<br/>It too has a game state in our model.<br/>Almost all games do; our model doesn’t just apply to full-blorb games.<br/>(Some games have very unblorby rules about creating&amp;injecting entities into that gamestate. I.o.w. “making things up as you go along” vs “adhering to prep”.)
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The Laws of Saliency further follow the principle “wovon man nicht regieren kann, darüber müssen die Regeln schweigen” in the Wallpaper principle.</p></div></blockquote>They’re not <em>that</em> schweigen since wallpaper can <em>become</em> salient.<br/><br/>PS <a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a>: when I suggested that you toss the bag I had utterly forgotten abut the flasks in it. It was only the vivid image of a bag landing on stone that made me think “Wait, weren’t there some flasks in that bag?” So I myself made the same mistake that Birdsong did. (The vivid imagination—shared or not—is an amazingly important part of game state!)<br/><br/> </div>

So it’s clear that their model has been fruitful in terms of design.<br/><br/>But their designs can be made with our model as well:<br/><br/>In a 2097 <strong>while writing a module</strong>: “Hmm maybe I’ll add a troll to this room on the map? Naw…” The troll wasn’t injected into the game state and thus was never canon. [<a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a>: An example of a referent being created without having its symbolic representation be part of the game state!]<br/><br/>Similarly, in Nerver av stål: “Hmm, maybe I’ll reveal that silver tongue is a runaway nun, escaped from a convent” and then later play leads to a state where she never is or was a runaway nun, because just as 2097e has you inject (or not inject, in this case) trolls in the game state <strong>at prep time</strong>, Nerver av stål has you inject (or not inject, in this case) runaway nuns into the game state <strong>at utterance time</strong>.<br/><br/>Both games have rules about creating&amp;injecting entities into the game state; just very different rules.<br/><br/>(Not all of our model’s rules are applied at prep time; the characters moving from room to room is an example of in-play game-state changing.)<br/><br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> I know we agree on a lot but I’m still trying to hammer out exactly where we diverge because I think any disagreement could be fruitful. <br/><br/>So has anyone seen game sessions like this.<br/><br/>The goal of everyone is to make a story but people are kind of, well, not that engaged. They’re all making fiction but there is no actual sense of tension, urgency or consequence. It’s almost like an intellectual exercise. Occasionally things come together and produce an alright story but the process of getting there isn’t that great. You’ll get players trying to be interesting by engaging in hi-jinx, because otherwise play is just kind of dull. If there’s a GM they often compensate by introducing something crazy or trying to ramp up the tension, but it never really works. At best you get these kind of good improvisational bits in a sea of tedium.<br/><br/>We’ll call this the Thespian problem.<br/><br/>Does Blorb solve the Thespian problem? In some cases it does.<br/><br/>Does Apocalypse World solve the Thespian problem? No it absolutely does not. In fact Narrativist design can’t solve it because Narrativist games are for people that don’t have the Thespian problem.<br/><br/>I think we both agree so far?<br/><br/>Where we might diverge.<br/><br/>If you don’t have the Thespian problem then adding blorb might in fact be slightly detrimental.<br/><br/>The Thespian problem is in fact a problem and not normal Narrativist play. (This is hard because we don’t want to judge fun but.. I’ve been in groups of Narrativists that, well let’s say they like a very laid back game rather than an intense one.)                        </div>

                            I am not convinced that the way people are talking about a "game-state" clarifies more than it muddles, particularly because it is being used to mean variously and possibly simultaneously (1) hidden fictional ("in-game") information about the game-world that someone during play is imagined to to wish to privilege; (2) information that is supposed to be purely game-mechanical (seemingly without, that is to say, a corresponding representation in the fiction; this may have implications for the idea of "dissociated mechanics"); and (3) fictional attributes of a character that nonetheless affect the options available to the corresponding player (e.g., "You're dead").

I agree that clarity with respect to<br/><br/>1. The game mechanical state, i.e. which game mechanical claims are true. (My character has 16 strength. You have four tokens.)<br/>2. The state of the fiction, i.e. which claims about the fiction are true. (The dragon is angry at Kalervo. The city is 17 kilometres from the dungeon.)<br/>3. Other claims that are true, but not part of the previous categories, supposing they exist. (???)<br/><br/>would be useful.<br/><br/>Another classification is<br/><br/>a. Things shared among and known by all the participants.<br/>b. Things known by only a single participant.<br/>c. Things not known to any participant.<br/>d. Other subsets of "who knows what".<br/><br/>I think at this point is has been settled that the gamestate includes 1. I am not sure if it has been settled that it includes 2; I think it holds that in traditional roleplaying games it will turn out to include 2 if it includes 1, because the border is fuzzy, whereas in some formal games 1 and 2 might be disjoint. I do not know if 3 is meaningful or non-empty. My suggestion is to define the game state as 1 and see what follows.<br/><br/>The shared imagined space seems to be the intersection of 2 and a (or 2 and d, perhaps); I'll just abbreviate it as 2a (and ignore the complications of d, which are unlikely to be conceptually interesting).<br/><br/>All combinations of 1-2 and a-c are meaningful.<br/><br/>1a: The game master has declared that the giant is wearing a maille and has armour class 16. We can all see that you have a deeds artha, since the red token in front of you means that.<br/>1b: The giant has 54 hit points. We just started playing and everyone has made their character separately. Only you know that your character has lockpicking skill 65.<br/>1c: We use an online random character generation. Your character is there, you have copied it, but nobody has read it yet. The game master has placed a module in their sandbox but has not read through (all of) it, yet, and so does not know the stats of various creatures therein. (I have done the latter. There is one such module in my sandbox right now.)<br/>2a: My character is hiding under the bed. I have said so.<br/>2b: I have decided that my character has a tattoo on their back, but this has not come up in play yet.<br/>2c: The adventure module the GM has not entirely read through contains many examples.<br/><br/>No myth play is saying that 1a and 2a (and possibly 1b or 1c, but certainly not 2b or 2c) are relevant for play. Blorb/klokkverk is saying that all the combinations of 1-2, a-c, are relevant.<br/><br/>I am, on purpose, glossing over the detail about classifying things that were known but have been forgotten by someone or everyone.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>If this is useful, maybe someone wants to give good names for some of the categories above.                        </div>

                            Bill’s post, above, describes my concerns/objections pretty well. I’m not sure I have much to add. I’m not at all convinced that any two people are even talking about the same thing yet. That makes it harder to engage!<br/><br/>I do have some questions, though. Hopefully these will help people refine their thinking:<br/><br/>1. What, in practical terms, does this model or way of thinking give us that the following doesn’t?<br/><br/>* This game gives certain players the authority to prep certain information, and that prep must be honoured when we play.<br/><br/>(If the answer is, “nothing yet; we’re still exploring!”, that’s totally fine, by the way. Do carry on - I’m all for exploring other ways of thinking. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> )<br/><br/>2. How, in this model, can we explain what’s happening when a mistake is made and isn’t noticed?<br/><br/>For instance, the GM misreads “green goblin” as “green dragon”, and we play out the session. A green dragon is fought and lots of stuff happens. <br/><br/>a. We discover this much later, and have decide whether to retcon a good deal of gameplay (after all, lots hit points and other effects could have affected all kinds of long term developments since then). What if we decide it’s too difficult and complicated to do so? What if the players argue that they legitimately fought a green dragon, risked their lives, and won - that it wouldn’t fair to rescind the XP awards they received as a result?<br/><br/>b. Perhaps even more telling, when it comes to the nature of the “model”, what if <i>the group never notices the error</i>, at all? How do we describe/explain the resulting play, in this model or this way of thinking?<br/><br/> </div>

See, here's the thing. From my perspective, playing a game of let's pretend <i>together</i> is functionally equivalent to saying fictional things in conversation. Without that step, we're not doing it together. The idea that you can make it so that the rules of the game obviate the centrality of that step seems likely to be wrong to me.<br/><br/>I am reminded of the story of the three umpires--these are the referees in the American sport of baseball who are charged with determining if the ball thrown by the pitcher has entered the batter's "strike zone," in which case the batter's failure to hit it counts against their three strikes, or whether it has not entered the strike zone, in which case the batter's refusal to swing is good judgment, since after a certain number of such "balls," the batter is allowed to advance to first base. Anyway, the three umpires are discussing their craft, and the first one says, "They're either balls or they're strikes, and I call 'em as they are." The second umpire shakes his head and says, "Well, some are balls and some are strikes, and I call 'em as I see 'em." The third umpire takes a minute to finish his beer, and then he says, "They ain't nothing until I call 'em."<br/><br/>The point of the story in this case is of course that rules require interpretation, and so where interpretive authority lies and how it's legitimated are important issues in making sense of how games that are like RPGs work.

But isn't it more complicated than that? There's no actual fridge, only propositions about fridges and their contents that one or more people at the table are authorized to make. If you make a note to yourself, "There's cake in the fridge here," it's in the expectation that others will ask you, "What's in the fridge?" rather than assume that the contents are somehow "typical" fridge contents or tell you what's in the fridge. To the extent that what's in the fridge is different from what they expect--"Hey, there's cake in here!"--it might matter to them because of what it tells them about what's going on ("Ah, someone's planning a birthday party!") or because it's potentially helpful ("I'm starving! I eat the cake!") or harmful ("Yuck! I'm allergic to chocolate!"). If none of those things are true, and it's just an extraneous detail of no particular significance, then why does anyone care whether there's cake or not in the fridge?<br/><br/>[1] "What's in the fridge?"<br/><br/>[2] "What do you think is going to be in the fridge?"<br/><br/>[3] "Some moldy cheese, expired milk, and brown lettuce, probably."<br/><br/>[4] "No! There's cake!"<br/><br/>[5] "Really? Why?"<br/><br/>[6] "Because that's what I decided before you opened the door! <i>The cake was in there the whole time!</i> Doesn't the world feel more real?"<br/><br/>Maybe no one would ever ask [5], but [6] doesn't seem to me to be a satisfying answer in any case. To be fair, I suppose an alternative response could be:<br/><br/>[6a] "Because that's consistent with what has previously been established in the game-world, but there's no other value, meaning, or importance that should be ascribed to that proposition." <br/><br/>This is where the issue of salience pops up, which seems to me to be asking something like what if I say there's cake in the fridge and somehow it matters when I didn't expect it to? My own answer would be, great, wow, what clever players! what fun and interesting play! <br/><br/>So, I love the description of three tiers of prep to ensure internal consistency and diegetic coherence; that's a really valuable procedural insight. But seeking to assign GM-prepped information some sort of ontological priority in and of itself in the absence of attention to how authority is distributed around the table strikes me as conceptually unsound. It's very similar to my mind to how some OSR-adjacent gamers use the idea of a "world in motion" to avoid the idea that their game is "fictional."<br/><br/> </div>

                            Paul I have answered that exact green dragon green goblin question a few times now, and I’ve discussed this whole error handling red herring at length in a few posts. Maybe it got lost in the flood. That’s fine, I’ll sort it out for ya:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485775/#Comment_485775" rel="nofollow">You asked it two days ago and here is my answer then</a>, it also links to <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485678/#Comment_485678" rel="nofollow">this, which is the longest and most detailed answer</a>.<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485435/#Comment_485435" rel="nofollow">Even that wasn’t the first time I answered it, here is the first answer; a short &amp; concise answer that’s still good.</a> (Uses the “forget to do double damage” example instead of “misreads green goblin as green dragon” example.)
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>1. What, in practical terms, does this model or way of thinking give us that the following doesn’t?<br/><br/>* This game gives certain players the authority to prep certain information, and that prep must be honoured when we play.</p></div></blockquote>The new model allows us to make a lot of rules about how and when to add/change information in the game state, including but not limited at campaign start, between sessions, in play etc.<br/><br/>Like, OK so someone once wrote this Yahtzee principle:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/The Yahtzee Principle" rel="nofollow">The Yahtzee Principle</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>You can point to the pages of your book all you want to. You can imagine stuff in your head all you want to.<br/><br/>The fact is that nothing happens, in the dice tray of role-playing, unless someone rolls it and the number on the die face is seen. Even if the book says, “On a critical hit, you do double damage,” your character won’t actually do double damage on a critical hit unless someone recognizes it and rolls it.<br/><br/>Role-playing is made of rolling dice like apple pie is made of apples and crust and scary amounts of butter. Whatever fiction you use, you are agreeing to use it among the group, usually as a creative inspiration or constraint, specifically as a way to affect what dice are going to be rolled.<br/><br/>“System (including but not limited to ‘the rules’) is defined as the means by which the group agrees to roll dice during play.”</p></div></blockquote>And like that’s cool, that’s cool. That’s <em>one</em> way of looking at things….<br/><br/>And that design school created a bunch of various dice system. The Whispering Vault, that weird Godlike system, Otherkind dice, Burning Wheel with all of those traitor dice, Gumshoe’s minimalist 1d6, or Prince Valiant and Ubiquity with their d2 pools, and Fudge/Fate with their custom dice, not to mention Genesys… and then someone is like ok, ok, we get it, the dice part of the resolution is interesting and fun to design things around, but we want to design the actual, you know, talking part? Can that also be part of the system? And we can actually resolve things without rolling dice?<br/><br/>And let’s say that the response then is
<ol><li>What, in practical terms, does this model or way of thinking give us that the following doesn’t?</li></ol><ul><li>This game gives certain players the authority to create certain fiction, and that fiction must be honoured when we roll dice.</li></ul>And we <small>(modern audience that know that not all RPG design is about coming up with the coolest dice system “no, I like BELL CURVES”)</small> go slackjawed in disbelief… Like… a lot? and not all RPG design is about coming up with the best way t o talk either. The game state is something that we want to create a variety of interesting operations on.<br/><br/>Our model is fundamental in order to create a rich variety in how we work with the other parts of the experience that aren’t just rolling dice (Yahtzee principle) or talking (LBCBP).<br/><br/> </div>

I felt that the resolution protocol broke down a bit. SMH at how modules sometimes go into deep detail about something that I would’ve easily &amp; gladly improvised without colliding with any saliency principles but they skip details on secret doors &amp; traps. But that’s just another example of how the design work we are doing here will hopefully end up being useful to module writers and game designers and why this model is important &amp; good. Because they’ll learn to write traps &amp; secret doors up properly.<br/><br/>The tar in that example became salient in a way that <em>hindered</em> the players, not helped them, for the record.

<a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">@Bill_White</a> I agree that social questions (authority, communication, etc.) should be priorities in design. But the fact that "There's no actual fridge, only propositions about fridges and their contents that one or more people at the table are authorized to make." doesn't prevent me from making a side step. Let's pretend there's a fridge, and a cake in it. What can we see and infer from this view point is what matters. Maybe nothing will come out of it. I don't know, let's find out. <br/>Aviatrix's model conflates the existence and properties of fictional things, and other rules. It looks a lot like the SIS model, but with a clear "algorithmic" perspective.<br/><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> To me, the fictional state is part of the game state, but it's hard to communicate and handle, so it gets abstracted and sometimes deformed in the process.

                            Hello,<br/><br/>If the GameState can be changed without reference to the SIS then what's to prevent the following from happening?<br/><br/>Alice - Because she's a sneaky thief and doesn't care for Bob's moralizing writes on her character sheet, "I switch Bob's healing potion with a lethal poison".<br/><br/>The GameState has been altered but not the SIS.<br/><br/>Bob - After a nasty and brutal battle crosses out on his sheet "One flask of healing" and returns his dangerously low HP's back to full.<br/><br/>Again the GameState has been altered but not the SIS.<br/><br/>Both notes were made before either player had any knowledge of an upcoming ambush.<br/><br/>According to some of what has been proposed both neither statement needs to be communicated to the SIS as we have authority to operate strictly on the GameState level without need to communicate these writings and thus such notations have automatic credibility.  They simply "are."<br/><br/>Shortly after the notations were made on both sheets and not communicated the GM runs a battle and Bob takes a loss of HPs that put him below zero.  The GM says, "You're dead."  Bob replies, "No I'm not, I drank my potion of wondrous healing and I was at full HPs.  See, I wrote it on my sheet."  Alice jumps in and says, "Sorry Bob, I swapped out your potion of Wondrous Healing for a Poison of Instan and Irreversible Lethality.  There is no saving throw and no possibility of any form of resurrection."<br/><br/>Given that we can function at the GameState level without reference to the SIS (as proposed) how is this situation resolved?  And what does resolving mean?  Is it sufficient that this be handled only at the GameState level with the GM making a notation his pad of paper but never communicating it or does this need to be resolved at the SIS level for the resolution to have credibility?<br/><br/>Because as the description stands, as I understand it, the actions I described are permissible.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            I'll raise you one, Jay.  Many years ago I had a Troublesome Player - a real shit-stirrer - who decided that his character hated <i>hated</i> <b>hated</b> one of my NPCs, so bad that he wanted to kill him. This NPC was a staple character in my D&amp;D world, a character I liked to imagine had plot insurance, though only in a de facto way (Players recognized him as a significant part of the setting, found him useful, returned to him for missions and advice, etc).<br/><br/>So TP challenges me to a fight, and everyone is excited. We broke from regular session and actually took a day to prepare ourselves for the big duel.<br/><br/>Next day we assemble at TP's house, and the battle is played out. Wishing to be as impartial as possible, and also to focus on the fight from an "immersed" perspective, I hand over the GM role to one of the other Players.  After a few rounds of swapping damage and narrative positioning, TP succeeds in scratching my character's face.  He begins smiling deviously. The room goes quiet. Everybody else knows something I do not.<br/><br/>I ask what's going on. TP reaches into his pocket and pulls out a piece of paper he had written the previous night and had already shared with the other Players. He hands it to me. It reads: "POISON UNDER NAILS."<br/><br/>I'm required to make a saving throw. I fail. My favorite NPC is dead.<br/><br/>Ok y'all -- what happened here?  Analyze away!                        </div>

I know how I'd handle it but what tools would use lie with the LBCB Principle and the SIS.

                            Yeah, great examples from Jay and AsIf.<br/><br/>This is where the “game state” model (or whatever we’re calling it) loses me. Like Jay, above, I can’t even begin to make heads or tails of what’s going on. What’s part of the game state? What’s not? When was it introduced? At what point did it become “real”? (Whereas from a Forgite, Lunpley Principle point of view, it’s crystal clear in every instance.)                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> some things you want to communicate about. The potion has become poison, that's all well &amp; good, and because we have frequent potion poisonings players tend to announce when they drink potions so as to not make this confusing thing happen. But the announcing isn't what makes the potion drinking real. It's just a way to clue everyone else in on the new game state.                        </div>

                            Ok! First of all, <a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">@Bill_White</a> is writing some good stuff - so far, I feel like he and I are exactly on the same page regarding all of this. I haven't had enough time to post about any of this really thoughtfully, so I'm glad Bill is doing so with more care and diligence.<br/><br/>Second, if you feel it's clear under the "gamestate" model, I'd love to hear how you would analyze the other examples (mine and Jay's). It's when breakdowns and errors occur that, in my opinion, the "truth" comes out and the real mechanisms of play are laid bare. Sure, when everything goes well and smoothly, it all seems like it makes sense. What about when it breaks down? Let's look at the problem cases. So far, I can't see how they can even be understood from the gamestate point of view.<br/><br/>For instance, when did that player write the note, and when did the nails "get poisoned"? What happens if I write, "I poisoned my nails yesterday, before the events of our last session" on a piece of paper? In that instance, "when" did the poison actually get applied to the nails?<br/><br/><small>AsIf's story is absolutely clear to me from a BCB Principle perspective (as is Jay's). I can explain how, if you like, though I'm a bit surprised that would be news to anyone. Do ask away if you think there's some kind of sticking point there and we can go through it!<br/><br/>I don't think any of the LARP examples are an issue, either, except maybe in the case of a LARP a person plays alone and doesn't tell anyone about - the theory does, admittedly, break down if there's only one participant. Not sure if that's a problem, though.</small><br/><br/>Third, that brings me to the "green dragon" and poor Sandra being frustrated at me. (Sorry, Sandra! I can't quite keep up with the pace of these discussions at the moment.) I'll try to summarize quickly in the next post...<br/><br/><small>(And I have no idea what that note about the hardholder is, Sandra! If it's important, or referring to some previous conversation, let me know, but so far that reference is not ringing any bells for me.)</small><br/><br/>Fourth, Cat playing D&amp;D with Sandra is one of the most wonderful bits of news I've received in a while. It makes me all smiles and excitement! (Wish I could have been there!) I'm really looking forward to that dialogue.                        </div>

Here's the problem with <a href="/forums/profile/Aslf">@Aslf</a> that makes for an imperfect example.  The player with the poison apparently communicated his possession of the poison and how it was prepared with other players.  It entered into the SIS.  The NPC died that too was entered the SIS.  The other players had already been given knowledge of the note before game and that the PC had both the poison and applied it at the appropriate time was given credibility by the other players.  The LBCB Principle was still employed.  Aslf could accept the ruling of the DM pro-tem - LBCBP in action.  As a person Aslf could contest this and a big argument could break out and after hours of fighting decide that yes, he agrees that the statement "Your character is dead" is credible and thus it enters the SIS - LBCB Principle.  Aslf could refuse the outcome there is no consensus and the game grinds to a halt until a consensus is reached (the NPC is alive, dead, the provenance of the poison is shown to never have been run through the SIS [IOW the player of the poisoner cheated by putting poison on his sheet without seeking credibility], etc.) - LBCBP.   Whatever happened in this particular example does stem from actions occurring in SIS and the result was entered into the SIS.  <br/><br/>The real problem is as Jeff indicated - <i>the provenance of the poison</i>.  If the poisoner never passed the method through which he gained possession of a poison through the SIS then said player cheated WRT to standard gameplay theory.  Unless there was a Rule that allowed him to propose and allow himself full credibility without communication the Proposition that he possessed a poison ex-nihilo.  If the provenance of the poison was handled properly then Aslf is out of a beloved NPC.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

I think I've read and reread those posts four or five times now, but, no, I don't feel they address my basic question or the examples at all.<br/><br/>In those posts:<br/><br/>I hear you reiterating your model, explaining in different ways. Helpful, sure.<br/><br/>I hear you explaining that mistakes can and do happen in any manner of play. Cool!<br/><br/>I hear you showing and explaining how you might go about correcting such mistakes. Great!<br/><br/>But none of that is what I was trying to get at. I want to know:<br/><br/>* Let's look at a failure case (a "mistake"), such as the ones I've suggested.<br/>* Let's assume that, in our example, it never gets corrected at all. Whether because the players don't notice, or because they decide it's not worth the trouble - it doesn't matter, as far as I can see.<br/>* How do we analyze/describe/understand what happened in such a failure case from the standpoint of this new theoretical framework?<br/><br/>That's what I want to see. I think it will be quite instructive.<br/><br/>I actually think that the "2d6 SWN example" could be our best bet - a really simple and easy one. I could talk about what's happening there from my perspective, if it would help. I do NOT understand how we can really think about that from a "gamestate" mindset without twisting ourselves into pretzels.<br/><br/>For instance, the "gamestate model" suggests that the vorpal sword is "real", whereas the "green dragon" is not. Do you feel that's an accurate representation of the hypothetical game I've described, where a bunch of adventurers go into a dungeon, never encounter any kind of vorpal sword, but do meet a green dragon that turns out to have been raised by the adventurer's father? Because that's not how I would look at this.<br/> </div>

                            Less relevantly, I can respond to Sandra's thought on the "utility" of what we're doing, because that's pretty cool. I don't expect a response to this - I'd much rather hear about the 2d6 and the green dragon! - but it might help someone reading along understand where I'm coming from:

What, in practical terms, does this model or way of thinking give us that the following doesn’t?<br/><br/>* This game gives certain players the authority to prep certain information, and that prep must be honoured when we play.</p></div></blockquote>
The new model allows us to make a lot of rules about how and when to add/change information in the game state, including but not limited at campaign start, between sessions, in play etc.<br/><br/>Our model is fundamental in order to create a rich variety in how we work with the other parts of the experience that aren’t just rolling dice (Yahtzee principle) or talking (LBCBP).<br/></div></blockquote>
If that's the case, that's great! I'm skeptical that we need this model to do that, though, and I have yet to see an example of an idea or rule or rules change which requires us to discard the BCB Principle in order to come into being. <br/><br/>Why do I need a "new model" to make rules about prepping material for my game? Even the very earliest versions of D&amp;D had rules for that. <br/><br/>If you replace "talking" with "interpersonal communication", in the last sentence I quoted above (which you really should), then we can start talking about what that might be. Are there things we do when play an RPG together that aren't about communicating with each other in order to construct an imaginary setting, sequence of events, and so forth? If we can identify some, that would be pretty cool. I think. (I don't claim to have thought this particular part through in any detail. :P )<br/><br/>What do I see as practical ideas, relevant to this discussion?<br/><br/>Here are some ideas to explore that I'm seeing here, which I like and want to explore more, but that don't (in my opinion) have anything to do with the BCB Principle or that whole theoretical understanding of games:<br/><br/>1. Let's talk about ways to do principled prep, and to handle information involved in our games that's not shared. Let's find new and cool and better techniques for the use of secret information at the table. <br/><br/>Awesome. 100% down. <br/><br/>2. Let's look at ways to communicate and to create, transform, or inject new information into our games that's not based on talking.<br/><br/>Also awesome! <br/><br/>(Although it seems to me this is only an issue because of the sloppy "Bog Model Wiki" text, which Sandra - understandably - took quite literally. I don't anyone who's given it more than two minutes of thought *actually* thinks that the only way we can communicate is by talking. So my disagreement here is with that Wiki entry - Sandra and I agree here, as far as I can see.)<br/><br/>3. Let's discuss the idea of a "game state", as an analogue or metaphor which has all kinds considerations in it aside from we're narrating in the moment: physical information tracking (notes, tokens, dice, electronic devices), details of fictional positioning, and the implications of the rules we've agreed upon (and how they limit our ability to imagine events together). (Maybe other things, too.)<br/><br/>Cool. Perhaps this will spark some ideas for new design, too. That would be awesome!<br/><br/>(Although I'm skeptical, because, as far as I can see, that's just the "old" way of looking at RPG play which existed and was explored pretty fully, in my opinion, in the 80s, 90s, and still is today, especially by many trad gamers and the OSR crowd.)<br/><br/>4. Let's find ways to make the fiction seem more real, concrete, and tangible.<br/><br/>Super!<br/><br/>I don't feel that any of these in any way invalidate the BCBP or whatever other theoretical ideas in any way. I feel 100% comfortable working with them from that point of view - there are no contradictions.<br/><br/><small>It's when we start talking about some kind of strange "real" thing which "exists" somewhere, when it - very clearly, to me - does not in any way, shape, or form, except perhaps in wishful imagination, that I start to worry. Aren't we conflating fantasy and reality if we do that?</small> </div>

                            Here's another thing to consider:<br/><br/>If we imagine that "content" gets "injected" into the gamestate in some fashion other than us communicating it to each other, how do we determine *when* that happens?<br/><br/>Let's take AsIf's story. What if that player had written, on his note, "I put poison under my nails two days ago, just previous to the events of our last session"? <br/><br/>Let's say the last session was a week ago (in the real world), and the events of that session a day ago (in diegetic time). The player wrote the note today, at 8am. We met to play at 4pm, and the poisoning finally happened at 7pm.<br/><br/>In that case, since we're trying to argue that the gamestate has some "real" tangible existence, *when* did the poison get applied to the character's nails? <br/><br/>This is the kind of thing that I find crystal clear under the BCBP, and I would like to hear how you would visualize that under a persistent "gamestate" model.                        </div>

What you're not accounting for is that the human beings communicating at the table still gave the proposition credibility.  You still get around that.  If a player disagrees strongly enough the game comes to a halt and could end the campaign altogether.  Role-play is what people communicate and agree upon.  That part can never go away.<br/><br/>WRT to the proposed rule - "reasonable actions that players write down on paper are true, even if nobody's read them yet" <i>which did not exist in the recounting</i> actually would read as -<br/><br/>"reasonable <del>actions</del> proposals that players write down on paper are <del>true</del> given default credibility, even if nobody's read them yet"<br/><br/>...could stand if all the players <i>agree</i> to abide by it - LBCBP.  But then we run into the adjudication of whether the written proposal was itself <i>reasonable</i>.  This would then require players to agree as to whether the proposal met the <i>reasonable</i> threshold.  This agreement process is still LBCBP.<br/><br/>By the way, the pulling out of the note and showing it to the players is a communication process itself.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Yes. Saying "I poisoned my nails" carries a certain level of credibility.<br/><br/>Showing that you had written it earlier (by, e.g., putting it into a sealed envelope) increases the level of credibility dramatically. That's the whole point of doing so: to prove that you had the idea *before* the events which took place, making it much less likely that the other players will refuse to acknowledge that you did so.<br/> </div>

If the note is never shown ever then the poisoning never happened.  No one knows about it.<br/><br/>If you mean he never showed the note during the game then the credibility of his proposal ("I have a lethal poison applied under my fingernails") would have to be established. However I can guarantee you with certitude that <i>nearly</i> all tables would cry "cheater".<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/> </div>

                            I actually think your example is a perfect illustration of precisely why authority and credibility <i>are</i> the core issue!<br/><br/>The special ability from the core book and the marble in the hand give the player <i>authority and credibility</i> (almost unimpeachable credibility!). The act of opening his hand and showing the marble communicates his action to the other players. <br/><br/>Consider how different that same moment in play would be if there was no such rule... ha! The player simply can't do so without the authority granted by the rules.<br/><br/>That special ability in the book established credibility in the same way that the GM's notes in the module text did for the cake in the fridge.                        </div>

                            Orthogonal to the larger discussion but submissible as evidence in regard to the poison: TP's character was an assassin and did indeed have poison. That point is unquestioned.<br/><br/>Less tangential was the fact that as set forth by me myself, we were both tactically noodling with our character sheets the night before the fight. The implication here being that whatever arrangements and tactical plans we made "off screen" were indeed real, as long as our characters didn't suddenly acquire something they hadn't already possessed. In other words, if any <i>transactions</i> were said to have occurred (ie: "I went to the poison store and bought poison for 300GP"), some other Player might have rightfully called foul. I would have also called foul since I was still the acting GM at that moment, and interaction with an NPC would have required my participation.<br/><br/>Of course, another interesting question is raised here: Is the GM still the GM even when the session has ended and nobody is at any table? But it's easy to answer Yes in this case, since this was <i>my</i> gameworld, and the day of the fight was the first and only time I ever handed over GM responsibilities for that world.<br/><br/>In my model at the time - I'm still not sure what to call it - there was no rule broken. I was unhappy and felt betrayed by the other Players (one of them might have warned me, for instance, though that would have opened yet another epistemological can of worms)... But I did not refute the acting GM's ruling, nor that the application of the poison had indeed occurred.                        </div>

(And I really hope Sandra gives it a name, like the "mirror story" and the "Ice Moon story". <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )<br/><br/>I hope your sense of betrayal was more one of surprise than of legitimate disappointment in your friends, because that sounds like a lot of fun.                        </div>

                            I felt a degree of legitimate disappointment, but it was admittedly illogical. One of the other Players spoke to me afterwards about it, saying that he wished there had been some way <i>in-game</i> to warn me, but there hadn't been. And I had to agree. In order for him to have warned me, he would have had to inject OOC information into his character (actual game-state data, not merely an idea), and we all knew that even with my fave NPC on the line, I wouldn't have agreed to the "reality" of that.<br/><br/>So we have the following things to ponder about:<br/>1. What is considered injectable from Player to PC? (answer in this case: No to "game-state data" but Yes to "mere ideas" - because how could you not?)<br/>and<br/>2. Who needs to know about changes in game-state? (answer in this case: at least one other Player, whether or not their PCs are aware of it.)<br/><br/>What I find interesting today is the fact that we all accepted the logic of the answers given above without even blinking. It's interesting because <i>that's how well-formed our shared understanding of the rules of the space was.</i>  The reason he needed to have shared the note with at least one other person prior to the beginning of the fight was to prevent me from being able to accuse him of having written it <i>during</i> the fight.  And we all knew that without even discussing it.                        </div>

                            I really like the awareness on all sides of how to set up the order of events properly: you ceding GM responsibilities, the other player sharing his note, and so forth. It speaks to a high degree of self-awareness as well as familiarity with the group. Lovely!                        </div>

                            For what it's worth, I just don't think the SIS / LBCBP way of looking at things and what Sandra is doing are contradictory. They seem kind of orthogonal to me. Some things may be subsets or supersets of each other, or whatever, but there's really no fundamental disagreement with what came before here.<br/><br/>That orthogonality isn't trivial, though: Sandra's design efforts here are going in interesting directions. I <i>disagree</i> with Paul that she's just resurrecting the old "the rules are the physics of the world" model. There's at least the same level of self-awareness here as we see with any modern game text, for one thing, and a real understanding of semantics / linguistics / semiotics, for another. <br/><br/>Also, Sandra's 5E modifications seem to be mindful of the realistic limitations of humans, compared with, e.g., GURPS or Champions. (2097e doesn't have square roots, does it? ;-) ) That is, much of the design work is about making the game playable, without sacrificing important principles. (I think the amount of dedication and time that 2097e requires is a bit daunting, but that's fine. Making a blorb design that is nevertheless relatively low-stress to GM is probably an important future design horizon.)<br/><br/>I can also think of at least one really dramatic example from my own gaming past that can be meaningfully interpreted via either LBCBP or GameState. This was a failure, something that led to the complete collapse of a campaign. And it was basically my fault! <i>And</i> it involves blorb-related issues! I've been reluctant to share it because seriously, it makes me look like a total jerk. But it's just so relevant!<br/><br/>Post incoming.                        </div>

If I came across this way, I should clarify and apologize. I don't think that's Sandra's position at all, nor do her design efforts seem based on that at all. However, there have been a few comments in this thread (mainly from others, I think, not Sandra) which were leaning heavily in that direction, and the whole idea of "a REAL gamestate that really exists" suggests something along those lines. I was reacting those in the moment when they were being made. I want to caution anyone who wants to go in that direction, so they can consider past debates and put some thought into how their model might need to be formulated so that it <i>doesn't</i> recreate that kind of old-school "rules as physics of the game world" concept.<br/><br/>I'm also trying to contribute some Actual Play content myself, on a related topic, over here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22140/ap-prepping-for-dogs-in-the-vineyard-and-blorb-narrativism-and-game-state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22140/ap-prepping-for-dogs-in-the-vineyard-and-blorb-narrativism-and-game-state</a> </div>

                            So, Burning Wheel. I join a campaign in progress. 4 pre-existing players; I am the 5th. Two of the other players are well-known to me, and are experienced GMs, but the actual GM is someone new to me. Still, the other guys seem to be having fun, and of course I love BW, so I jump in.<br/><br/>The campaign is this sort of weird fantasy post-apocalypse archipelago thing. The two guys who are experienced GMs also have characters that are powerful wizards; there's no way my incoming character could ever measure up. But, I find a way to carve out a niche for myself, or so I thought: given the constraints available to me, I managed to create a character who is both a doctor and a lawyer, and who has some scholarly skills to boot.<br/><br/>So I end up doing things like treating wounds and advocating for the group with important NPCs. Sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail, but it's basically fine.<br/><br/>Then another player and I write a new Belief at the beginning of the session. They're worded differently, but both of us are interested in uncovering the true history of how the apocalypse came to this world. We read our new Beliefs out loud, and the GM doesn't object to them. (Cue ominous music.)<br/><br/>During the session, we get a chance to work on this Belief. We make a series of rolls: first a Circles test, to find the noble who has the historical records from the time of the Fall in his archives. Success. Second, a Persuasion check to get him to give us access to those records. Success. Third, a roll on my History skill (supported by my Research skill; combining skills like that is a thing you can do in BW—people can try too hard and cheese it, but in this case it was super obviously relevant, or SO I THOUGHT [DUN DUN DUN]) to uncover the <b>real truth about the apocalypse</b>.<br/><br/>Record scratch. <br/><br/>The GM says, "No, you can't use History to establish that. You'd need [this very specific type of skill that I didn't have]" to do that. And I basically freak the fuck out. <br/><br/>Aside: The thing I didn't have was what's called a -Wise skill in BW. Like, if you have Forest-Wise, you can roll to "know" things about forests, but since BW GMs don't tend to prep very much, you're mostly using the skill to declare facts about the setting. Consequences for failed rolls can vary, but the GM can basically twist whatever it is you're trying to establish in some dramatically appropriate way. Now, my thinking was that, while History as a skill may not be usable to create facts <i>ex nihilo</i> the way Wises can, surely in context History was appropriate, especially given that I also had (and was using) Research: I was literally, in-game doing Historical Research. And the prior rolls had established that the information was <i>here</i>, in *this* archive.<br/><br/>But anyway, what ends up happening is that I bully the GM into letting me have my way. There's really no other word for it. I basically made every possible appeal to authority imaginable, complained, got a bit loud, etc. It was... not good.<br/><br/>So, I get to make my roll, I succeed, and now officially we know (and in fact I was able to make up) how the Apocalypse happened. But then we wrapped up the session and never played again.<br/><br/>Now, while I do feel bad about it, I've actually never been able to figure out exactly what would have been a better way to handle the situation. Since, even though I was the one who actually started arguing back, there was a pretty serious, and multifarious, failure on the GM's part here!<br/><br/>1) Failure to pay attention to characters' Beliefs—remember, advocating for your characters' Beliefs is literally the entire point of play in BW.<br/>2) Failure to think through the consequences of the prior two rolls.<br/>3) Failure to think through what it meant to say "no" to someone rolling History combined with Research to... do historical research. (This is the part of the story I think is most salient to GameState theory!)<br/>4) Failure to properly blorb a reason for the apocalypse. (I just wanted to know what had happened, and for my character build decisions to matter, but I absolutely would not have cared if the GM had had hidden information rather than me needing to come up with the reason myself.)<br/><br/>As I said before, I believe this incident can be analyzed in terms of both theoretical models under consideration here. But I'm going to leave that to others as just posting about it was tough.                        </div>

                            Hi Jeff,
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Pretend TP's character has a special ability straight from the core book that says, "Once in your character's lifetime, your character may secrete a contact poison (Con save DC 15, effect: immediate death) under their fingernails. You don't have to tell anyone else at the table when you do so. However, you do have to hold a purple cat's eye marble in the closed fist of your left hand."<br/><br/>And instead of revealing his note, TP had just opened his left hand to reveal a purple cat's eye marble.</p></div></blockquote>
That <i>showing of the marble</i> is the player's <i>act of communication</i> seeking to establish the proposition that his character "can secrete a contact poison" as credible.  That the eye references back to a textual rule in the book is an effort to boost his bid for credibility.<br/><br/>The hypothetical rule cannot force and enforce itself into the minds of the players.  They either agree to give the proposition credibility or they refuse it.  If at least one player calls BS then the one proposing (the poisoner) either has the option to either fight for it and try and convince the other players to give him credibility or the poisoner has accept that his proposition was not given credibility.  The poisoner can't force the players to accept his proposition nor can the dissenting player force the proposing player (the poisoner) to accept his refusal as the actual outcome.  All parties have to agree - or play stops while players argue over the Rules or someone votes with their feet and stomps off.  Nobody can be forced into accepting a proposition the don't want to.  Doesn't matter if the Textural Rules say this or that everyone has to agree.  It doesn't have to be overt as silent consent works just fine.<br/><br/>Credibility is oil by which the gears of the game turn.  No credibility, no turning gears, no change.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

I was just responding to Deliverator's post, to clarify that was NOT what I was doing. It was not intended as any kind of remark aimed at you.<br/><br/>I DO want to caution anyone involved in this discussion, whoever they may be, to keep an eye out for slipping into that kind of thinking, though.

Imagine another character interjects into the duel. Chances are that the wrong person is poisoned. An assassin player with the right agenda will find a way to allow for an adjudication of this.

We have rules for level 9 assassins to make these kinds of secret purchases but they're very specific, so we don't get into the whole Blades in the Dark "retro-planning" or the whole Adventuring Gear DW style thing.<br/><br/>This thread is making me want to make more such rules but again keep them very specific and some sort of pre-commitment (rather than pre-<i>announcement</i>) necessary.

Right, but, like, when we stopped clinging to the Yahtzee principle we started making great design. You could still say that the Yahtzee principle applies to very very many roleplaying games (and in a "Yahtzee principle–ruled world" games like Amber, Microscope etc might not've been called roleplaying games) but us shedding the Yahtzee principle tunnel vision was still an important development.<br/><br/>Any diced roleplaying game could be described in terms of the Yahtzee prinicple and then there's some principles about fiction that you also need to apply in order to get to all the juicy dice-rolling. <br/><br/><br/> </div>

Or I say "get me some gum" and she says "what flave" and I say "orange" and she buys orange gum then the gum falls out of her bag and I forgot that I asked for gum and she forgets that she bought gum so none of us ever know that the gum existed. That blows any kind of grocery store model entirely out of the water.

It would be interesting to see if Jay, Bill White and Paul agree that all of the above are meaningful and can be used in game design. As is, I am not sure if you believe that 2b and 2c are possible, which seems strange, since I have done them.                        </div>

                            I would love to see how 2b and 2c have been used in game design. I would argue that neither is meaningful.<br/><br/>2b. You can obviously decide in your head that your character has a tattoo. It can't have a meaningful effect on play until you communicate that fact to others and it becomes a 2a.<br/><br/>2c. It's obviously possible for the DM to decide in their head that "if the character explore the Eastern Mountains, they'll find the module, <i>White Plume Mountain</i>, which I've never read". This has absolutely no effect on the game until the the PCs go to the Eastern Mountains, the DM opens <i>White Plume Mountain</i>, reads the parts of the module that the PCs are interacting with, and communicates those facts to the players, making it 2a.<br/><br/>I would also even argue 1b. and 1c. aren't meaningful, until they become 1a. Their only significance is how they affect play. If you never roll your 65% lockpicking skill, your character's ability to pick locks in the fiction is as undefined as what color underwear they're wearing (assuming that hasn't been discussed and decided in play at some point.)<br/><br/>EDIT: That first line isn't meant to be taken as sarcastic or antagonistic. If I saw examples where 1b, 1c, 2b, 2c, can be used to have a <i>meaningful impact</i> on play before their existence becomes public knowledge or at least their effects are felt, and therefore becomes 1a or 2a., I would definitely change my thinking.<br/> </div>

                            Furthermore, I would even argue that if your character sheet says, "Lockpicking 95%," but every time you attempt to pick a lock you manage to fail your roll, assuming this ends up narrated as you just not being able to do it (instead of being justified with some kind of "the guards interrupt you" or retroactively narrating it as "this lock was actually enchanted") as far as the fiction is concerned, your character is bad at picking locks. The things written down on your sheet, in the module, or anywhere else are only true in so far as they affect the fiction and the group accepts (implicitly or explicitly) that they occurred.                        </div>

That was not okay on multiple levels.<br/><br/>First of all, you guys were trying to resolve out-of-game problems (animosity between you and TP) in-game, which is generally a bad idea and the original sin here: You weren't going to resolve anything; instead, you were going to hurt one another, jockey for social dominance etc.<br/><br/>Secondly, TP unfairly expanded the arena of competition to include pre-duel preparations. Either he or the interim DM should have suggested that you play out your NPC's days prior to the duel to give you that option, too (or to prepare a last will of whatever). The important thing is that you seem to have had different expectations ("Let's settle this with a single - implied: kinda isolated from the rest of the game - duel.").<br/><br/>Finally, using the other players for independet verification of his ploy was a no-go because it meant that you were socially isolated. Being the unwitting butt of a joke is not a very comfortable position to be in at the best of times, but we usually try to be good sports. But when a person you have issues with (e.g. a rival) is in on the joke, that's not cool at all. The other players should have shut this down when informed of the secret ploy because going along with it isolated you socially. Not cool.<br/><br/>So that's my take -- and it contains quite a few assumptions, so please correct me if I am wrong.                        </div>

Things known only to a single person can and will affect that person's decision making, so they certainly can and will have an effect on play. Maybe I go for the scenarios where lockpicking seems more likely due to the skill.<br/><br/>(That there are unknown things also affects decision making, if we know of their presence, even if it their nature is unknown.)<br/><br/>The two more relevant factors are that things in the game state need not have any effect on gameplay, and that the set of people who knows a given fact is a function of time.<br/><br/>An example of something in game state not affecting gameplay, outside roleplaying for clarity: Consider a multiplayer strategy game with map exploration. None of the players happens to find the resources that were in a corner, simply because nobody happened to explore there. Yet the resources still were part of the game state, I would say. This can happen in most games of imperfect information. Or the "topmost card of my Magic deck" - a well-defined object in M:tG  that can be interacted with. It was part of the game state even if the deck was shuffled or the game ended before I had a chance to draw it.<br/><br/>The other matter is that "what is known" changes as the game is played. When preparing things, or making a character, I can not be certain which things will appear in play (in most roleplaying games). Yet, preparing things ahead of time gives me time to think and execute complicated processes, whereas doing things during play places heavy limits on how long the activity can take, to give an easy example. Hence, different kinds of rules mechanics are viable during preparation and during play. This certainly has game design implications.<br/><br/>Being under less pressure also leads to different decisions.                        </div>

The game is broken. You can think that the (former) participants disagree about the game state, that there is no game state, or you can think that the game master has his own private game with its own private game state.

2b can be meaningful <i>indirectly</i>, if you are the GM.  A villain has been terrorizing the villagers and threatens to kill anyone who speaks of him.  Thus, when the PCs ask certain types of questions or make certain types of statements, the NPCs get all weird but won't say what's going on.                        </div>

Game state is essentially a collection of statements that are true of the rules-defined entities, and in Burning wheel, also of the fiction (since much of Burning wheel resolution relies on the fiction).<br/><br/>In your example, I assume you thought or guessed that the game state already contained information about the apocalypse. The game master probably thought of seeking that as a long term campaign goal and had not made a decision, binding or otherwise; that is to say, the nature of the apocalypse was not in the game state.<br/><br/>In Burning wheel, the game master is not supposed to have much secrets, but this does not mean they have to tell everything, so the game allows this kind of mismatch of expectations. Furthermore, the game is expected to contain both pre-defined content and improvised content.<br/><br/>The wise rules are pretty interesting in that, when used, they query the game state (has this been defined, i.e. are there statements about this in the game state or not) and then work differently based on the answer. (Or this is the common folklore; I just quickly checked BWG and did not find where it discusses wises and player authoring of facts. It was not in the relevant parts of the skills chapter, at least. Replace "wises" with "circles", if necessary.)<br/><br/>I am not sure there is much more to say, here, about the incident from the perspective of game state.                        </div>

                            Hello,<br/><br/>A little bg before addressing some questions.<br/><br/>The big tripping point in the early Threefold Model was that it rested on the internal states of the players - goals.  As a theory it might hold but it fails as a diagnostic model because self-disclosure of goals and actual observable behavior were very often at variance.  It wasn't particularly useful for game design as the designer had no reliable data to work with.  The other issue was defining what role-play actually was.  Each group defined role-play in terms of their own techniques.<br/><br/>The follow up theory was based on <i>observed</i> behaviors which made it much more useful as a diagnostic tool.  It also employed a description of play that allowed for all three modes of play while explaining how they were all a form of role-play.  Because it was focused on observable behaviors the model then defined play in the present progressive.  Role-play is not a state but an activity.  As this model of play was observation based it did not only look at Exploration but the interactions between the players on an interpersonal level during play. *hint - this is very important*  Play floats on a <i>Sea of Exploration</i> "where Narrativist and Gamist priorities ... are defined by an <i>interpersonal out-of-game agenda.</i>"  This "out-of-game" part implies the GameState idea that is currently being floated.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> posted this upthread which I think is amazingly astute and extremely useful but got very little attention.
<blockquote>In fact, there's absolutely nothing that appears in both the imagined reality and in the game state! They operate on different types of symbols.</blockquote>
I couldn't agree more.  The SIS is not a subset of MIS, but rather they are two completely different spaces, that function in completely ways and are utterly dependent on each other.  I've been referring to the SIS as the "fact space" as I think it is conceptually useful.  What is being called the GameState encompasses everything in the SIS but encompasses everything up to and including the Social Contract level as well as Creative Agenda's.  This construct I am calling the "Concept Space".   This "Concept Space" is what I think about the facts of the SIS, where I individually store knowledge about our Characters, Situation and Setting, where I consider propositions that I might share in an effort to get it included into the fact space (SIS), the notion that Bob is arachnophobia so I won't use my shapeshifting spell to turn into a spider, where I consider whether I am enjoying what is going in play or not, etc.<br/><br/>The idea I'm trying to formulate is that the Concept Space is highly dynamic, ephemeral and subject to change all the time.  However as the structure is strictly Conceptual, supremely individualistic (definitionally) IOW that which is in our minds (that includes physical objects that having meaning to the individual but have not been used in an act of communication) while necessary to play is not sufficient unto itself and can do nothing to the fact space until communicated.<br/><br/>These two differently functioning and structured constructs cannot, cannot, cannot exist or function in isolation.  These two constructs are and must be in constant communication with each other.  One direction is passive and observational while the other is overt and highly ritualized.<br/><br/>I will also offer that while the GameState/Concept Space can act upon itself it cannot directly act upon the Fact Space/SIS.  The Concept Space can and does make itself relevant when a concept is formally and ritually communicated.  FREX I as the player can be made angry by something a player says outside the Fact Space (out of game) but this anger belongs to the realm of the Concept Space.  My anger does not affect the game unless I communicate my anger <i>it some way</i>.<br/><br/>Neither construct is more important than the other but neither can operate in isolation.  The GM prepping a game is not roleplay<i>ing</i>.  The GM is prepping.  A GM prepping a game is no more roleplaying that an actor memorizing lines is considered act<i>ing</i>.<br/><br/>Yes I think the GameState is vital to role-playing.  Without it the player has absolutely no game present in mind at all.  I don't disagree with the idea of a GameState at all.  I do take issue with the proposition that individual concepts by themselves never leaving the mind or being acted upon (like showing everyone the marble) have effect.  I think that is a category error.

Actually no.  That fact has not been established.  Conceptually the individual player in their individual GameState may conceive it be so but that does not make it fact.  The GameState does not generate facts it only produces concepts.  To generate a fact the proposition must be communicated and given credibility to be treated as a fact thus entering the proposition into the fact space.

That's what I was driving at: There is never just a single 'gamestate'. There is one 'gamestate' per participant. <del>Functional</del> play happens where these intersect, i.e. in the SIS.<br/><br/>With this reasoning, the term 'gamestate' is a very poor choice of words as it implies some unified, objective existence. (At least the term 'real' has apparently been dropped as Sandra notes in another thread.)<br/><br/>[Edited June 19th to add: I have since stopped trying to redefine the term and have accepted it. I regret my harsh choice of words.]<br/><br/>Moreover, I think that it is not possible to a priori consent to future additions to the gamestate. Sure, I can promise that I'll grant absolute authority to the GM when it comes to, say, handling our grimdark fantasy setting, but that's a statement of intent, presumably by every participant. However, the agreement cannot be enforced once you introduce unicorns pooping rainbows, either because I just won't accept this and we both claim a breach of contract ("that's not grimdark fantasy" / "you must honor your promise") or because the unicorns wreck my suspension of disbelief to the point where I cannot really play anymore (I might try to humor you, but my buy-in is gone and my ability to feign interest may be limited).<br/><br/>(Like the error correction question, the example is indeed about the right - or even the ability - to add content.)<br/><br/>[Edited to cross out "functional" and remove confusing brackets around "never" and to note this was crossposted with Jay.]                        </div>

Well, it cannot become part of the SIS unless everyone consents, i.e. everyone would have to accept the proposal when it is introduced. By contrast, it seems that it could become part of the so-called 'gamestate' by various means. When that is revealed, it should surely be rejected and the gaming group would dissolve, but it would still be nominally considered 'canon'. This makes the proposed concept of 'gamestate' ... unsafe.                        </div>

If you think that makes it safe, we already disagree fundamentally on how to create and use good safety tools.<br/><br/>I.o.w.

I really love that you are <i>so</i> into your character that the nominal canon becomes the dividing line between safe &amp; unsafe but that's not how I work.

Games with secret information do need a different set of safety tools. The X-card for example is utterly useless &amp; insufficient, we need a much more comprehensive approach.<br/><br/><small>But to bring this back into logic&amp;reason: the game state can have contradictions that can be resolved if they are detected. Just like the tattoo/green-dragon thing. Similarly, the SIS / transcript can also have contradictions that can be resolved if they are detected [and go unresolved if they remain undetected]. You can create lines or X-card or whatever to be part of the game state (just like prep is part of the game state) ior you can create safety tools that are on a completely separate layer from the game state.<br/><br/>Drug-demon can be such a contradiction if the prep says he does exist and some safety tool says he doesn't exist. One way to resolve that contradiction is to remove him, just as how an X-card could. But, again, without a time-machine there's no way to <i>actually</i> unsay him. And the LBCBP doesn't help you there, you have that problem in both models.</small><br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22143/safety-tools#latest" rel="nofollow">Here's my safety tools thread</a> but you can also start a new, more specific one if that's better.                        </div>

                            Guys (Jay &amp; Johann), you are doing pure, unsubstantiated semantics right now, just redefining terms:<br/><br/>trying to turn “fact space” into a synonym of the SIS and trying to turn “game state” as something that is separate for each player and trying to turn “game state” into some sort of concept space.<br/><br/>Redefining terms is not making reasoned arguments.

Opening the fridge <em>and saying there’s a cake there</em> makes the cake part of the SIS. No one in the entire thread is currently in disagreement about that.<br/><br/>Calling the SIS the sacred “fact space” and the game state a mere “concept space” is just an extremely provocative yet still utterly pointless renaming of terms.

But that doesn’t change a single thing about the underlying workings of either model. You’re only making new names for things.<br/><br/>We’ve been using the word “fact” to mean our propositions in the game state. You changing that word to “concept” and then applying the word “fact” to only a subset of those “concepts” is meaningless when it comes to the semantic content of our model, you’re only working on the lexeme level. I could say that things in the game state are “birds” and things in the SIS are “seagulls” but that doesn’t mean that they will suddenly start eating fish.<br/><br/>I’ve been pretty sloppy &amp; generous with what things are called; “blorb / klockwerk / MIS / game state / offscreen canon / SIS / fiction / transcript” I generally try to hold the prinicple that I’m not married to any specific definition or usage of a particular word, as a way to avoid semantic swamps.<br/><br/>But these terms “concept space” and “fact space” and this redefinition of “concepts” and “facts” do upset me.

Me and Jeph are obv aware that words can be used to mean whatever the heck you want.<br/><br/>You can come up with a definition of “fact” where the Blackrazor becomes factual when used to fight an elf for the third time in a week because you define “fact” as “something that’s been used to fight at least three elves in one week”.<br/><br/>That doesn’t change a single thing about how things work. But words <em>do</em> matter for how we want to design games since they have connotations &amp; provide affordances. In the game state model, we are obviously interested in that second event: plunking down S2 on your campaign map. To us that is an extremely fundamental predicate. You can call that “real”, “a fact”, “a concept”, “a bird”, “a horse”, “a hot guy in jeans”, “false”, “an unfact”, “a fish”, “a dream”, whatever!<br/><br/>But if we want to get on the same page we need to respect each other’s terms &amp; vocab. I’ve yielded on the strict 4-sense definition of the word “shared” giving rise to the much clumsier construction “MIS”. I’ve accepted that two actors don’t “share” a stage in your model and have adapted my use of terms to accommodate that. Same with the word “real” when that caused widespread panic. Please consider reciprocating this accommodating sensibility.<br/><br/><small>The Blackrazor was constructed <em>as a <strong>referent</strong></em> when S2 was written in the seventies.

Pretty much, ya'll convinced me that "all the operands of the rules" is the most useful definition of game state. Which almost always includes the SIS.<br/><br/>Though as <a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">@yukamichi</a> pointed out, in Shinobigami, the SIS pretty much is NOT an operand of the rules. So, there's that.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Jay's terms "concept space" and "fact space," but I think I AM a big fan of the idea I think he's driving at (<a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> let me know if I'm off base!)—<br/><br/>Each player at the table has different beliefs, opinions, etc about imagined events and the other operands of the rules.<br/><br/>Each possible combination of players has a common ground that embodies yet other beliefs, opinions, etc about imagined events &amp; rules operands.<br/><br/>Prep and mandates of the agreed-upon rules embody yet more, different propositions about those things.<br/><br/>And an uninvolved observer of the game, like us watching recorded sessions on YouTube, yet others.<br/><br/>And <b>none of these perspectives is invalid</b>. Each is a different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">modal frame</a>.<br/><br/>To say anything at all about imagined events or the state of the game, you have to take a perspective. You have to use SOME modal frame. And every single one of the frames above is valid and meaningful. Each one is useful to consider, think about, and design against.<br/><br/>At least that's my takeaway.                        </div>

That's what I was driving at: There is never just a single 'gamestate'. There is one 'gamestate' per participant. <del>Functional</del> play happens where these intersect, i.e. in the SIS.<br/></div></blockquote>
Well, that was an example of broken play.
<blockquote><br/>With this reasoning, the term 'gamestate' is a very poor choice of words as it implies some unified, objective existence. (At least the term 'real' has apparently been dropped as Sandra notes in another thread.)<br/><br/>Moreover, I think that it is not possible to a priori consent to future additions to the gamestate. Sure, I can promise that I'll grant absolute authority to the GM when it comes to, say, handling our grimdark fantasy setting, but that's a statement of intent, presumably by every participant. However, the agreement cannot be enforced once you introduce unicorns pooping rainbows, either because I just won't accept this and we both claim a breach of contract ("that's not grimdark fantasy" / "you must honor your promise") or because the unicorns wreck my suspension of disbelief to the point where I cannot really play anymore (I might try to humor you, but my buy-in is gone and my ability to feign interest may be limited).<br/></blockquote>
Gamestate is (I think) defined as the set of true claims (or propositions or whatever) required to adjudicate the rules of the game. This definition does not work for freeform play, but does work for most other roleplaying and many other games; not really useful for games of physical skill, I think.<br/><br/>I am running a game. We are using a game which travel rules - the difficulty of a travel roll depends on the distance and the terrain, as well as how settled the area is. As soon as these things are determined, they become part of the game state. Thus, the rules for travel can be adjudicated. When they are not part of the game state, the rules can not yet be used.<br/><br/>As far as I see, you are discussion a different question of what kinds of input into the fiction is acceptable. It can be that the game master has added unicorns to their encounter table, used them to restock a dungeon, etc., and thereby added unicorns to the game state. If the players later object to the unicorns and the group comes to the conclusion of removing them, then the game state is changed accordingly. There is no problem here.<br/><br/>If you want a situation where the game state has split, you should consider either two separate groups playing in the same world, or maybe a group that has forgotten something and only later remembers it. This is a matter of error correction and has already been discussed several times.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The concept also works with a more abstract ruleset; consider a game where players take turns to add a sentence to a story and it must not contradict the earlier contributions. Here, the game state includes the turn order and the previous contributions (I am ignoring safety issues and such for simplicity.): In order to continue play, we must consider what has been already said, and whose turn it is to contribute next.<br/><br/>In order to make a move in chess, one must know the position of the pieces, whose turn it is, and the details about castling and repeated moves. Who is playing black and who is playing white, too.                        </div>

I'm not an expert there, either) is clean and logical.<br/><br/>Well, here is a good example, perhaps:

A lot of you are trying to nail down when something becomes a "fact" or "enters the gamestate", and of course you're going to have all these different criteria, weird corner cases, and so forth.

But how can you pick one of those five uses (above), or ever stick to it consistently?<br/><br/>By comparison, as I understand it, in BCBP/SIS terms, this kind of thing is much easier to conceptualize. Each player has some mental image/model of the game we're playing, and none of them coincide perfectly. Maybe the GM knows there's a cake in the fridge, and I know it, too, because she slipped me a note saying so, but Alice doesn't know. And maybe I also know that I'm under a "mind bending" spell, so the GM's note could be a lie. <br/><br/>Each player can be aware or unaware of a fact, and each player has to accept or reject each such fact.<br/><br/>Whenever and wherever any fact or piece of information is given legitimacy by the players interacting with that fact, it enters their Shared Imagined Space. You say "look, a pink elephant over there!", I accept your statement and imagine it, too, saying, "ooh!", and now we've created a SIS, which has a pink elephant. Credibility and assent.<br/><br/>In a group playing a roleplaying game, all the facts or statements that are given credibility by all the participants are part of the group's SIS, and that's what we use to play: that becomes our game's "board" and "pieces". <br/><br/>So, there are no "facts"; nothing is real or not real or part of the game state or not part of the game state - just bits of information that each of us knows or doesn't know and assents to or not. <br/><br/>Every time we start to establish something as "being fact" or "not being fact", it seems to me we're bound to head down an interminable rabbit hole of neverending confusion. That's my concern with this whole discussion.                        </div>

Yes, we are doing our best to not use the word "fact".

Something becomes part of the game state when it is available for use in resolving what happens next in game.<br/>This fundamentally does not require communication in a traditional roleplaying game. A game master adds a unicorn to the game world. It is now part of the game state, since it is available for use in resolving actions, for example casting the "locate unicorn" spell and tracking rolls to find horse tracks.

Baker-Care-Boss principle, shared imagined space and so on are theories about power, credibility and communication. It is useful to think about them when thinking about such issues.<br/><br/>Game state is the propositions you use to determine what happens or can happen next in the fiction, when you use Baker-Care-Boss system to do so. System tells that the game master has authority to add unicorns. Game state contains the information about who is the game master and where have they added unicorns.                        </div>

Well, the game state model nerds (or at least yours truly) have been using use 2 and Jay started using use 5 (and then maybe switched to use 4).<br/><br/>As Thanuir says, we also often try to avoid the word altogether because our usage of the word has been so upsetting to you but it's really impractical to do so consistently because <del>it's a fact that there is a Blackrazor over those mountains</del> see I almost did it again. It's similarly upsetting to <i>me</i> that there's no reciprocity around this whole vocabulary eggshell stepping you're having us do.                        </div>

                            You want to teach the model, make it visible. You've got to do it by hand, going against assumptions and "what's already there". For this, you've got to let words find slightly deplace partners : what you want to name had no name before. <br/><a href="/forums/profile/Johann">@Johann</a> Great job ! How do you think your model departs from the SIS ?<br/>Right now, challenging the theory keeps it strong, but I think people need more than "social dynamics" to make it yield results. A bit of focused, private work.<br/> This bubbling of words is not a bad thing, but there should be more games, techniques or alternative models before taking it seriously. <br/> </div>
