So he did. It took about a minute and a half for him to type it up and send it to me.<br/><br/>So here's the situation. Princess Ananya's on her sapphire throne, her eyes glowing a strange blue glow, and EVIL Duke Larkam is whispering behind her, in Wormtongue Style. She repeats his words, sentencing three traitors to DEATH! <br/><br/>Who are these traitors? OH NOES TEH DANGER PATROL!<br/><br/>And their executioners? Six-Winged Crystal Dragons. To which Rich's explorer quips, "again?"<br/><br/>What we got out of the PO's was 1) a flashback to a younger Doc Neutron advising a younger princess about the challenge of responsibility and how he would always be there to protect her. Awesome. 2) Raygun Annie on a balcony in Rocket City with a handsome, well dressed man, saying "I've come to have strong feelings for you, Dick, " then whips out her raygun, "but I'm arresting you anyway." Awesome. Then a bit with Thragomar (I might have the spelling wrong), a resistance fighter on Saturn, discovering that the Duke has a STRANGE DEVICE. I particularly like that T's player decided he was from Saturn without knowing where this adv was taking place. AND that he joined DP right out of the Saturn resistance. Neato.<br/><br/>This scenario used resistance. The dragons ignored two hits for every action until the aura was dealt with. That was mean fun. Heh heh. <br/><br/>One thing that popped up in the fight was that blend of action framing and causality. T's player wanted to do a sneak attack and use his agent stuff, but he was out on a platform Annie had started flying around. Does he need to spend an action getting into place to do that stuff? If so, what does he do with the hits he generates? I think it'd be cool maybe to save hits on a setup move. He decided to fly up behind the palace with his rocketpack and fly through the secret back entrance. <br/><br/>The other one was "using detective to find the source of the aura," and Rich got three hits. That's enough to completely defeat a threat. So I decided that the Duke realized he was found out and fled the scene with his STRANGE DEVICE. That worked pretty well.<br/><br/>Raygun Annie maneuvered the floating platform right through the crystal viewing window, which generated enough danger for me to introduce a panicking crowd. That was fun. "Oh, look, there's no longer a crystal window between us and the dragons."<br/><br/>And Doc Neutron just happened to know the mating call of the female crystal dragon. Unfortunately he generated enough danger that it really sounded more like another male dragon.<br/><br/>Thragomar used his electroblaster to stun the guards (a new threat), which was cool. So John you can feel better about the electroblaster.<br/><br/>A thing I really liked in one of the interludes was the DP trio investigating the Duke's activities on a recon. Using their new crystal dragon mounts.<br/><br/>We had to close up shop in the middle of the second action scene, which was an assault on the Duke's secret Titan fortress. I'll post more about that scene when I take care of some work stuff. It occurs to me that this scene should be very much player led. "How do you want to do this assault? Do you want to sneak in?" I didn't ask enough of those questions and probably should have, but it was still fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220428/#Comment_220428" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T16:19:15+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  4:19PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>T's player wanted to do a sneak attack and use his agent stuff, but he was out on a platform Annie had started flying around.

So, if the Agent wants to sneak around and ambush the bad guys, it's one or the other, depending on what they do.<br/><br/>"I sneak through the back entrance of the palace to get the drop on the guards." Roll Agent for helping dice to your attack roll next round (probably Commando or Warrior).<br/><br/>"I sneak through the back entrance of the palace and plant micro knockout grenades to take out the guards." Roll Agent, do hits to the guards.<br/><br/>The types of threats in play are the main way you judge what does hits and what doesn't. If you have a "Security System" threat for the palace, then Agent moves definitely do hits directly. If the palace doesn't have any security or guard threats on the board, then all that sneaking is probably Help for some later moves.<br/><br/>If you have Agents and Detectives on the team, look for ways to include security, social maneuvering, investigation, and mystery threats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220492/#Comment_220492" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T21:09:08+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  9:09PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            sigh.
