I think that the quality of the game\u2019s should be most important dispite theme or genre; there are lots and lots of short games to choose from, but less that have been vetted via  rigorous play-testing and the like, and that actually <i>play well</i>.  Often concept is chosen over quality and a thorough vetting isn\u2019t done, do to the work load necessary.<br/><br/>I suggest making this the first criteria, and having the submitters play-test each other\u2019s games thoroughly\u2014have a requirement that submitters must playtest a certain number of their competitors games, vote on the best, group them by genre or theme, and then publish the book. Make sure to be patient with the process so that enough playtesting is done to separate the wheat from the chaff.

Consider, for example, sharing any dividends with all project members in the testing pool rather than just the final royalty-entitled authors (whatever meager dividends are to be had from an RPG book, anyway). Or not.

Reading this actually increases my interest in checking it out.<br/><br/>"Collection of short games by a single author, unified by genre/setting" (such as Protocol Fantasy) has never caught my interest powerfully enough, I admit - there's a bit of "I already have like a thousand one-shot games to try out" and a bit of "How can this one guy write these many games and they all possibly be good? Why doesn't he choose one big bad idea to showcase instead? Is this just the vanity press of RPG books?"<br/>This talk about a collection by multiple authors, especially with the "editing them for coherence" element, instinctively holds more promise to me: there's an air of mature project management and fostering talent to it that I find alluring. One pictures the established self-publisher with a record of successful kickstarters, regular convention attendance, established Internet presence dangling an opportunity before the oddball, punk game-designer who might chance upon it.<br/><br/>In fact, because of this increased interest I'm going to ask: if I were to buy and read just one of your works to get an idea, which one would you recommend? Which is the one you're most proud of? (I <i>know</i> it's a hard question to answer, totally unfair to a creator).<br/><br/>Now, if I encountered the multi-author anthology after the fact - and had never seen this one discussion - my interest in buying it would depend largely on the subject matter. Specifically, the more unusual, provocative, unexpected and politically charged the theme, the more likely I am to buy an RPG book - but that's me. Who are the contributing authors would be the other defining factor:<br/>- Do I know one of them and think they're a genius? The work of some authors I'm even an avid collector of - could trigger an "I can't miss it" effect.<br/>- Do I know <i>none</i> of them and they all look like a diverse bunch of people, from all corners of the world and walks of life, none of the usual suspects? "Breath of fresh air" effect will kick in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472429/#Comment_472429" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T10:24:44+00:00" title="April 19, 2018 10:24AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" rel="nofollow">James_Mullen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/jim pinto" rel="nofollow">jim pinto</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>a book filled with great game ideas that have been cracked and reformed to include only the essential elements because the book has already taught you what an ensemble scene is will only benefit from editing and playtesting.</p></div></blockquote>\nI would buy something like this: there are many times I've just been tempted to write a "General Theory of Storygaming" pdf and include it as a freebie with everything else I create, just so I don't have to write that chapter again for the <i>Nth</i> time.</div></blockquote>\ni have written so many advice books, i can't keep track anymore<br/><br/>i wrote the GM chapter for Legend of the Five Rings 4th edition in a day<br/><br/>here's my guide to protocol and story games:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/180167/Protocol-Primer-A-Guide-to-GMless-Gaming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/180167/Protocol-Primer-A-Guide-to-GMless-Gaming</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472430/#Comment_472430" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T10:32:37+00:00" title="April 19, 2018 10:32AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>"Collection of short games by a single author, unified by genre/setting" (such as Protocol Fantasy) has never caught my interest powerfully enough, I admit - there's a bit of "I already have like a thousand one-shot games to try out" and a bit of "How can this one guy write these many games and they all possibly be good?

With the other designers essentially riffing on these elements?  Of the GMless-ish variety, or the like?  I\u2019m having trouble understanding the exact type of game designs that the game\u2019s in the book would consist of; what would this language and these elements consistent of? And what would their features/qualities be like in the broad sense? I\u2019m familiar with your designs so you can use them for the purpose of comparison. Any info would be super helpful <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>I would personally be very interested in, and would purchase, the book, if I\u2019m understanding the type of book you\u2019re talking about making, if it rifted on similar designs to your own and other similar, tried-and-true designs in the GMless-ish/GM-lite design space, it would be really cool. I think you could very likely sell 500 copies, especially if it included a lot of other designers\u2019 games. If you go into the nature of the type of games you\u2019d include I could provide a better idea; people at Story Games SLC buy these types of games, we have about 130 members, so I could at least give you an idea about their level of interest.

With the other designers essentially riffing on these elements?  Of the GMless-ish variety, or the like?  I\u2019m having trouble understanding the exact type of game designs that the game\u2019s in the book would consist of; what would this language and these elements consistent of? And what would their features/qualities be like in the broad sense? I\u2019m familiar with your designs so you can use them for the purpose of comparison.

If you were work on a movie set, there's a language to how a movie gets made. Expecting players to know all the rules and tools of narration (how you write a story) is cumbersome. In order to write their narrative (the story itself), Protocol and Praxis remove the language of narration and reduce it down to the most essential parts: vignette, interlude, interrogation, ensemble, fork, intercut, etc.<br/><br/>Games do not even need hard and fast rules on how to use those scene-framing techniques. But making players aware of them and deciding what kind of scene you have takes a lot of guess work out of your turn as 'director' (another term I use to describe the person whose turn it is).<br/><br/>This language takes up anywhere from half a page to 12 pages of a book based on how developed one needs it to be.<br/><br/>BUT.<br/><br/>I honestly believe, the language of Protocol and Praxis scene-types should be in any and all scene-framing games. It is just that helpful for new players. And if I'm publishing someone else's games in my compilation, you better believe the compilation itself is going to open with that language and tell people, these are the types of scenes out there. They are training wheels for narration until you don't need them anymore.<br/><br/>And that's for the other kind words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472478/#Comment_472478" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T20:07:07+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  8:07PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that this plan looks pretty good - a book like that would certainly be a worthwhile endeavour. I've thought of doing something similar myself at some point. The technical editing will make individual games consistently understandable, and having the games all feature similar social footprint (tools, no. of players, time it takes to learn and play) helps a selection have practical utility.<br/><br/>I'm thinking, though, that it'd be even better if you did this as a website: you could update it over time with new games, sell it as a subscription service (free samples, 5 dollars per month of unlimited access?) and distribute author royalties in as simple or complex manner as preferred - by popularity, for example.<br/><br/>The length limit means that it's trivial for a person to print out the game they want to play, after all, or just read it off the screen. The games will also probably lean towards low replayability value, which makes a couple of sheets of print superior to a bound book on a per-session basis.<br/><br/>I will consider participation carefully once the concrete proposal takes shape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS" title="L.Trenti MrVALIS"><img alt="L.Trenti MrVALIS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/372/n6DOEFUWMI7ZW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS">L.Trenti MrVALIS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472526/#Comment_472526" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-20T04:54:42+00:00" title="April 20, 2018  4:54AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I will consider participation carefully once the concrete proposal takes shape.</p></div></blockquote>\nDitto.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472530/#Comment_472530" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-20T07:24:25+00:00" title="April 20, 2018  7:24AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2018 7:25AM by davey.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see this kind of thing (a compendium of short games that cohere to a specific set of terms of art) as a far more valuable offering than a book that elaborates just one game. Our playtest group in Seattle (only 4 months old technically, but with shared roots that go back some years prior) writes and plays games almost entirely within the size range you are looking at.  Not sure who among us would be interested.  There\u2019s probably a dozen or so games we\u2019ve brought to life in recent months. Most of these are still being worked on.   Are you thinking Kickstarter?  Paper and pdf?  Straight to drivethru?  <br/>I\u2019ll have to read some of your games!  <br/><br/>Anywho, interesting idea. One we might have been slowly slowly inching toward, but that hasn\u2019t crossed over into the manifest realm of discussion in our group.  I\u2019ll bring this up at our next playtest.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472531/#Comment_472531" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-20T07:36:14+00:00" title="April 20, 2018  7:36AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim, You live in federal way (I just discovered).
