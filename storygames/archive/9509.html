Page 77, <b>Make Characters and Play Now</b>. Use <b>The Hub</b> and <b>The Spokes</b> (that's everything through page 77 of the brown book).<br/><br/>All of you should focus on nailing Intent and Task and Artha awards. The players should focus on writing kicking Beliefs and learning Advancement. The GM should focus on setting Obstacles and twists through the consequences of failure. <br/><br/>Once everyone has that stuff down and feels comfortable, start introducing stuff from <b>The Rim</b> slowly and as appropriate. Feel out when it's appropriate to use more detailed systems (Fight!, Duel of Wits, etc.) and when to stick with Versus Tests and so on from <b>The Spokes</b>. <br/><br/>You don't need to use Fight! for a battle or Duel of Wits for an argument. In our games, we only go to those mechanics when it's a dramatically important scene. Otherwise, we use Versus Tests.<br/><br/>If others in your group are new to Burning Wheel, do yourself a favor: Before you make them sit down and make characters, download The Sword scenario from our <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads" rel="nofollow">Wiki</a> and play it with them. It's a one-shot, fun, and will allow them to get a feel for the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210889/#Comment_210889" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T08:57:42+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  8:57AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool.

If you know where you want to end up, pick your ending lifepath and work your way backward to a Born lifepath. That can often be easier. <br/><br/>2. Check <b>Leads: Moving to a New Setting</b> on page 15 of your Character Burner.<br/><br/>3. Check <b>Required Lifepath Trait</b> on page 23 of your Character Burner.<br/><br/>Honestly, just work your way through the <b>Character Burning</b> chapter starting on page 12 and make your character as you read. It's all laid out in step-by-step fashion. You may find it helpful to download the <i>Character Burning Worksheet</i> from our <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads" rel="nofollow">Wiki</a> (I recommend the PDF version). It can help you the first time through.<br/><br/>Also, one of our enterprising fans, Paul Drussel, has built an <a href="http://drussel.net/charburner/" rel="nofollow">Online Character Burning utility</a> that works very well. You may just try that.<br/><br/>Incidentally, with your character idea, you should ask yourself whether you want your character to have lived the life of a Thinker already or if seeking that life is where you want to start. If what you really want is a warrior who's trying to leave that life behind, make that warrior lifepath your last lifepath and start the game trying to learn what it takes to be a Thinker. If that's what interests you, learning Philosophy and Painting and so forth in game could be much more satisfying than starting with those skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210906/#Comment_210906" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T09:42:30+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  9:42AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>Very cool.

Etc.</blockquote>\nPart of BW is knowing that your character concept is going to change <i>during character creation</i>, not just during the "actual game". So like Thunder_God says, the more specific your idea is in terms of actual jobs and events, the harder it'll be to force the lifepath system to give you what you want. The lifepaths mechanically reinforce a certain type of setting. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But your example seems easy. First, I have no idea why you think Thinker is necessary. But let's say it is. You'll want most of your time spent in the Professional Soldier section. Pick a Born path that has a lead to Professional Soldier, like Born Peasant. You want to end with Thinker, so you'll need a lead to Outcast. And look, there's Veteran, under soldiering, with a lead to Outcast. Perfect. So grab something you like from soldier, like Foot Soldier, then (say) Sergeant, then Veteran, finally Thinker. Now you want a heart of a Poet? You've got 8 trait points and only have 1 required, Stubborn. With 7 floating trait points you can make him as much a poet as you please.<br/><br/>But doing it that easily does mean you need to know the basics of the lifepath system. Here they are: Each lifepath may be followed only by a lifepath in its section (like Foot Soldier to Sergeant) or by a lifepath in a section the original lifepath leads to (like Veteran to Thinker). By implication this means that the only way you can get to e.g. Thinker is by another Outcast lifepath or by a lifepath elsewhere which leads to Outcast. You automatically spend a trait point on the first trait (if any) in each lifepath's list. The rest can be spent freely, at a discount for other traits in your lifepaths' lists. Skill points are similar except they must all be spent on skills in your lifepaths' lists. General skill points may be spent absolutely freely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210972/#Comment_210972" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T15:11:56+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  3:11PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When making a character and wondering what to do when it has two root stats listed, take half of the average of the two rounded down.
