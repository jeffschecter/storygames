When I'm more awake and rested anyway.<br/><br/>The narrator just gets a pool of 10 or 20 Wonder and Feelings each depending on the depending on the nature of the scenario. You are correct that without any supernatural elements having Wonder for NPCs doesn't do anything. It's not totally inconceivable that a normal person could wind up in a position to spend Wonder (the most notable example I can think of is that foxes have an optional power that lets them give someone a present that provides a power). But I don't see how this is worth troubling oneself over; I think of it as a cap rather than an allotment to use.<br/><br/>One thing to keep in mind with the narrator's point allotment is that the game is really meant to be played on a very small scale. In all of the examples so far, there are at most two NPCs in a given scenario.<br/><br/>The reward of 10 Wonder and Feelings for a connection at strength 5 on both sides is only given once, during the next scene after the connection gets that strong. After that they'll get the usual 5 per scene.<br/><br/>The text isn't super-clear on stuff that awards Wonder/Feelings to NPCs (I'll have to ask the designer for clarification next time I e-mail him), but I just treat it as that NPC having extra above and beyond the 10 or 20, and in the session I ran at GenCon when that happened (a rabbit used Mochi Pounding to give an NPC some Feelings) I used those points right away.<br/><br/>The way I read it, having a thread and a connection are mutually exclusive. A connection converts into a thread at the end of a story, and a thread converts into a stronger connection when you meet that character again. It's not that you "can" remove a thread to get a stronger connection, it's that that's what happens automatically when you do an Impression Check with someone you have a thread to.<br/><br/>It's the connection from the town to the henge that lowers to 2 when you have a fight. It makes no mention about the other way. It's the town/community thinking less of the henge for having a fight, and the henge's view of the town remains unaltered. (I'll have to double-check my translation of that part).<br/><br/>Japanese RPGs in general give the GM a lot of authority, and favor relatively constrained play as a means to producing quick, focused game sessions. In terms of how the GM sets up checks and such, it is a more or less traditional game, and that's an area where Japanese RPGs as a whole haven't challenged assumptions yet. You make some good points about the difficulty table and such, but this part just doesn't grate against me the way it does you. Your viewpoint is important, but almost all of your complaints come down to the game being "traditional" in some places. Still, if you want to do a more story-gamish hack or some such, I'd love to see it.<br/><br/>The bit about lowering connections is not part of the official rules. I asked the designer if it was possible, since I remembered seeing something about connections lowering mentioned casually in the text, and it was more him saying, "Well, I supposed you *could* do this, but something's wrong if you feel the need to..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163420/#Comment_163420" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T17:23:18+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  5:23PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2008 5:26PM by Neko_Ewen.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite>What about the Narrator's bonus resource gain for 5/5 Connection and transformation costs for NPCs? I'm still not certain about those...</blockquote>\nAs far as I can tell, the special bonus for 5/5 connections and the transformation costs for NPCs should be treated more or less the same as for PCs. That is, an NPC henge would have to pay the cost for changing form just like a PC one, and the extra 10 points would be a pool for the narrator to play with, just like with Mochi Pounding and similar Powers.<br/><br/>I can definitely see the value of doing things differently for NPCs, but that's my interpretation of the rules as written.\n<blockquote>Only, I want to see the game in actual play first. Also, I'm somewhat reluctant to change the mechanic, as every change in basic rules might require adjusting some powers that interact with the rule.</blockquote>\nDefinitely. Actual play is important, after all. Part of why I'm mentioning this is because for this game I have a direct line to the designer, so if you come up with anything that you think is really useful or effective, I can send it his way. Plus, if we ever publish an English version, (1) any clarifications will be helpful, and (2) we can stick some variant rules and such in the back of the book.<br/><br/>OTOH once the new supplement comes out (Hitotsuna Komichi), Kamiya-sensei may be moving on to an entirely new game, hopefully one as interesting as his previous ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163454/#Comment_163454" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T18:19:18+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  6:19PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At this point it's still a vague aspiration to basically do with YK what we did with Maid RPG--bring a fully realized English version out in print. And as with Maid RPG, I definitely lack the funds to make it happen by myself. Andy's interested, but we're looking at something a year or two in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
