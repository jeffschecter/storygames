But the concept is so very noir.  We\u2019ll just transgress the boundaries <i>just this once</i>, and no one will get hurt.  The stories that arise prove that this is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we sat down to play <i>Dirty Secrets</i> at Go Play Peoria.  I haven\u2019t had a chance to play my own game of late, so I was pushing pretty hard to get it to the table.  Our table ended up with five players:  myself, Raquel, Tim, Dave, and Ian.  I was particularly pleased with Ian\u2019s presence.  He\u2019s a friend of mine, but he has done little or no roleplaying.  It\u2019s entirely possible that this con was his first serious exposure to roleplaying.  It was certainly his first exposure to Our Games.  On the whole, I thought that he did quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we had the time, I pushed for a Novella length game, which ended up being about four and a half hours long.  Not too bad for a con.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe experience levels of the players were varied.  Three of the five had never played <i>Dirty Secrets</i> before, and I\u2019m not sure what prior exposure Dave and Ian had to the genre.  Nonetheless, I thought that the game gelled quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy strict rules of the game, we should have set the game in Peoria, since three of our players were from Peoria and only two from Chicago.  But, since our investigator was from Peoria and because the previous RPG we had played was set in Peoria, we deferred and set the game in Chicago.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What Happened In Play</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Tim was our investigator, playing Harry Shelton, an ex-PI who had spent some time in jail for an unspecified crime.  Now he\u2019s out, bumming around, not doing much of anything.  He gets pulled into the case by Tanya Ventura, a young woman who he had mentored before he went to jail.  She\u2019s now in college and is being blackmailed for some minor hacking that she\u2019s done.  The blackmailer is threatening to turn her over to the police unless she and her group go to work for the blackmailer.  All Tanya can figure is that the woman who cleans her apartment might have figured something out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m not even going to attempt to reconstruct the series of events that resulted from this start.  Rather, here\u2019s what was <i>really</i> going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nJuan, Tanya\u2019s partner in crime, wasn\u2019t really her boyfriend, like she had originally claimed.  Rather, Ron Pastor was her boyfriend.  Or, should I say, Agent Ron Pastor?  We never established which agency he was working for, but it didn\u2019t really matter.  The two of them were working together to crack personal information databases and sell the information for money.  Juan was working for Tanya.  Sarah, an undercover cop, figured this out and, rather than arresting them, tried to blackmail Juan and Tanya into giving her a cut of the action. (Crime 1) Instead, Juan murdered Sarah, probably with Ron\u2019s full knowledge.  (Crime 2).  Then, Ron murdered Juan, probably to cover their tracks, although his motive was never really revealed.  (Crime 3).  At the end of the story, the cops had arrested Ron and were trying to get some initial information from him.  But then, a black sedan pulled up, and men \u201ctook Ron into custody\u201d.  Was this a cover-up?  Was this a rescue of an agent?  Were these rogues who were assisting Ron?  We will never know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the game, Tanya kept falling under suspicion and, as things began to unravel, began to act in increasingly violent ways.  When an agent attempted to gain access to her apartment, Tanya shot him through the door.  Later, she pulled a gun on Harvey while he was driving.  When he escaped from the car and was hit by a passing motorist, she shot the motorist when he stopped to help Harvey.  Then, she chased him down, forcing him to club her with a chunk of cinder block.  But, with all that, Tanya didn\u2019t actually do any of the Crimes that were defined in the game.  A perfect example of the system doing its job.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur closing scene was classic.  Harvey goes to visit Tanya in jail, trying to get her to blab on Ron for murdering Juan.  She refuses, and Harvey basically says the whole \u201cI raised you better than this\u201d thing, pleading with her.  She turns to him and says something like, \u201cOh?  And where were you the last few years of my life?  You abandoned me.  I know where you were.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nHarvey says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I failed you.\u201d  Then he turns and walks away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Trusting the System</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAbout halfway through the game, I was thinking, \u201cThis isn\u2019t coming together.\u201d  Stuff wasn\u2019t happening, energy was low, the investigator was wandering aimlessly.  It seemed like the game was failing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, suddenly, it wasn\u2019t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had forgotten that the first stretch of the game is all about building stuff and making things up.  Reincorporation happens later.  I hope that this doesn\u2019t sound arrogant, but I really should have trusted my game more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m curious to hear from the other players at the table.  In my mind, the pivotal scene was when Tanya was getting ready to bug out and then shot the agent.  That revealed that Tanya wasn\u2019t the innocent little girl that she was portraying herself to be.  This seemed to give the rest of the story the necessary energy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Sympathy for the Character</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Dirty Secrets</i> uses a rotating semi-GM system, where players take turns being responsible for Chapters of play.  However, being the Authority (as the game calls it) doesn\u2019t require you to portray all the Characters.  The narration rules allow anyone to narrate whatever they desire, subject to the Authority, and a specific application of this is that the Authority may assign the role of a Character to another player.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used this to good effect in our game.  Raquel really empathized with Tanya.  So, without consciously discussing this, I noticed that our group fell into a discernable pattern.  First, we\u2019d have Tanya do something awful.  Like, shooting an innocent motorist who was just trying to help.  Then, we\u2019d give Tanya to Raquel to portray, who would then try to do her best to portray her as sympathetic.  Repeat until end of story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis produced a fascinating dynamic, where we ended up with a surprisingly deep character who, despite all the horrible things she had done, managed to remain a sympathetic person that you could still empathize with.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this was a designed feature of <i>Dirty Secrets</i>, but I wonder if this technique can be adapted to other games.  Any thoughts from folks?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Conclusion</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI want to give a big shout out to my fellow players.  I really appreciated the chance to be able to play my game again, and I enjoyed being able to play this with you.  I felt like we were able to quickly enter a cooperative zone and work together to construct a satisfying story.  So, thank you very much.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
