My experiences with computer games made me think it would be possible. When the publisher and I decided that there would be multiple legends (in the prototype there was only one adventure) I thought to make the first legend very easy, like a tutorial in computer games, and increase the level of complexity with each new legend."<br/><br/>taken from this interview of the creator. <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3760" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3760</a><br/><br/><br/>If you have read some of the stuff i have written and thought it crazy. about games that can exist without a rule book. well Andor is the proof and a pattern you would do well to follow. and it works, IT WORKS SO GOOD. more thoughts later.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402527/#Comment_402527" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T17:17:50+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  5:17PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tyler, have you played it?

I get how learning through experience works in video games because you have a controller with buttons, and you press buttons to find out what they do, and then do those things in different game environments.  Does Andor do something like that with cards, or what?

Like you usually do with boardgames where the owner or most experienced player relates it to others and then they play from there. Sure there are boardgames that do need everyone to read up on the rules to play them, but many work from explanation.<br/>So I did not experience Andor as that unique. Still a good co-op game that creates some tension by it's own rules mechanics.<br/>Legends of Andor does indeed use cards where the stuff you need to know is written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402537/#Comment_402537" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T18:51:05+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  6:51PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            like any good tutorial it is harder to explain how it works than to have it work on you. so experience is the best teacher but it is also a 60 dollar board game so i will give it a shot and describe my experience.<br/><br/>The game has two booklets, sheets that have been folded to make four pages. one is the quick start booklet and the other is the reference booklet. there is no traditional rules book.<br/><br/>the quick start booklet gives you the minimum set up information and rules for the first turn of the game. This creates something of a tutorial board. It is a puzzle that the players work out and in doing so learn the basics of the game. the pieces placed on the board have descriptions of how they work when a player interacts with them. so very much like in a board game once you bump into something you learn naturally what that something is and what it does.<br/><br/>The game continues like this teaching new rules whenever it makes sense for you to learn them. Primarily this is done through the "legends" deck of oversized cards as this is the liner brain that drives the game.<br/><br/>as far as i can tell the reference booklet is used if you forget a particular rule and need to find it quickly rather than trying to find it in the legends deck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402540/#Comment_402540" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T19:20:11+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  7:20PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay, games that you learn through play!<br/><br/>Have you played <a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/silver-and-white/" rel="nofollow">Silver and White</a>, Tyler?

That sounds excellent.  Physical game pieces that first appear in the play space and then tell you how they work when needed -- slick!  And that deck -- does turning over a new card introduce a new rule?<br/><br/>I wonder if it'd be practical for an RPG to do something similar: have an ordered deck, flipping cards over in sequence to reveal new rules.  (Either some initial rule, or some part of the previous card, would have to tell you when to turn over the next card.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402559/#Comment_402559" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-03T00:27:10+00:00" title="January  3, 2013 12:27AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2013 12:29AM by TylerT.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The legends deck drives the scenario or "legend". in play it is designed to introduce rules and events as they become relevant to the flow of the game. it is a natural element of the game that also introduces rules. The deck is linear with cards in order and only drawn from when the game triggers it. a bit like the scenario cards from lord of the rings lcg.<br/><br/>The tutorial board is very slick. you start with the bare movement mechanics and it forces you to discover the interaction mechanics. and then further turns introduce monsters and fights and then the victory condition. <br/><br/>I think the comparison to SW edge of the empire basic box is pretty good, although that game is still serving some old RPG dogma that sort of hurts it a little bit. i have not played silver and white. <br/><br/>oh and one of my favorite things about the game is the deck of blank legend cards. giving players the oppratunity to write their own legend will encourage lots of fan made content ensuring the game has a healthy lifespan.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402992/#Comment_402992" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T01:40:41+00:00" title="January  8, 2013  1:40AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2013 1:41AM by Bad_Santa.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I picked up a copy.  Overall, I like it, though I think from a designer/writer standpoint, it is probably a little more difficult to produce effectively.  Often times the worst aspect of a board game is the rule book and designing the game to not need one nearly eliminates that problem.<br/><br/>My one complaint about that though is the reference sheet is often vague and unhelpful, and digging through cards to find the one tidbit of info you need is annoying when someone asks a question during play.  During legend one someone asked a question about interacting with something, we re-read the rules and came to a conclusion.  Then we played the second scenario and found out our original conclusion was completely wrong, because the rule was worded differently (and better) on the second card.  It's a neat format, but the necessary conciseness means problems can occur like that.<br/><br/>While not a terribly complex game, it was still relatively easy to learn and the game does a good job of walking you through itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
