In person would be fantastic, although my German skills are less than a year old, self taught, and pretty weak right now. So I'm also wondering about play by post/forum as an option, the time lags giving me the luxury to participate without placing a burden on others, and improve my language to boot.<br/><br/>But yeah, just throwing it out to the community. Wanna play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
