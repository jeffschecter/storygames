I mean, the scenario he's running feels like a straightforward quickstart adventure (ie, low on anything particularly interesting as far as the characters or the setting goes, but generally easy to follow), which is probably appropriate for that group at that time, but doesn't exactly make for gripping viewing. Which is sort of sad, because what I'd heard about the system sounded kind of fun, but man, you'd never know it from this session.<br/><br/>Maybe it was a "you had to be playing it" situation. Being charitable and all.<br/><br/><br/>edit: What's bugging me about Pramas is that he seems to have checked out from the whole session. I mean, for all the enthusiasm he shows for the setting and the action, you'd think he was reading a powerpoint presentation. And a particularly dull one, at that. I've played both of the computer games, the setting can support much more interesting things than we're seeing here; it can even go as zany as Chris seems to want to go with it.<br/><br/>I mean, you'd think he'd at least take Wil or Sam up on their occasional attempts to engage with the setting for the game or give them some room/reason to interact in character, but no, so far it's just one limply presented and poorly described fight scene (or brief "go here for the fight scene" conversation) after another. And since they're editing around the actual dice rolls and combat mechanics, there's really nothing to see here. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405598/#Comment_405598" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T14:39:22+00:00" title="February  6, 2013  2:39PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't watched the episode yet, but my experiences <i>playing</i> the game have been positive.

It's even possible that there's so much going on in their heads that it would be a waste of time for Pramas to put anything more into his performance as far as the players are concerned, because they're already full up on things to pay attention to.<br/><br/>But as a performance on video for an audience, it stinks on ice. There's so little going on for the viewer to actually, y'know, <i>view</i> here, that some kind of technical wizardry really should have come into play like the clever editing/film-grain filter for their Fiasco shows. Something that would actually be engaging for an audience, something to add a little verve and excitement to the affair. (Although asking the editors to fix a performance as lackluster and uninspiring as Pramas's may be asking way too much. I like the guy's work on paper, but he's just not bringing it to this table.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405693/#Comment_405693" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-07T15:30:09+00:00" title="February  7, 2013  3:30PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Damn those cameras bombarding these innocent people with performo rays!

I think one of the players said he was usually a GM which means he's into roleplaying and the other players were pretty creative.  My favorite character was the Elf who choose as his special power "Smell" something which Pramas had apparently intended for animals/pets.  I was seriously inspired by how useful the Elf made his smell talent, but I think Pramas was disgruntled everytime the Elf wanted a smell check.<br/><br/>The first sign I saw of trouble was when the PCs asked Pramas how the NPC boss received a message overnight?  I could tell he just wanted to send them on their mission and just gave them a "I'm a Grey Warden with special powers" explanation.  In contrast, in a game like Dungeon World, the GM could just as likely turn the question around and ask the players how the Grey Warden received a message.  I think Pramas underestimated the Group.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wes_the_mad" title="Wes_the_mad"><img alt="Wes_the_mad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nNGKML0VGFY5M.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wes_the_mad">Wes_the_mad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405896/#Comment_405896" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-10T20:15:08+00:00" title="February 10, 2013  8:15PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I think one of the players said he was usually a GM which means he's into roleplaying and the other players were pretty creative.  </blockquote>\nThat was Sam Witwer. From the extended interview and his occasional guesting on a Star Wars Roleplaying Podcast <a href="http://start.d20radio.com/home/the-order-66-podcast" rel="nofollow">The Order 66 Podcast</a> it's pretty clear he's very into Roleplaying. <br/><br/>I do agree though, the GM and the players seemed on 2 totally different wavelengths.
