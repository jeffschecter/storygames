Then Sage said that's totally not true and gave Moldvay as an example of how the game is basically an instruction manual and how that's awesome.

Not all games are supposed to be run the same. I guess you can figure out things on your own and things I've learned by running one game are portable to another. But you don't really play or run Cthulhu, 4E and Pendragon the same way. When a game has instructions that go with it, that makes it easier to grok if you're fresh to that game/style of play. I didn't play B/X when I was 12 so when I read that game for the first time I was coming to it fresh, no matter how old I was.<br/><br/>2. I like structure. To have clearly-defined bounds for what "an adventure" means makes it easier for me to run the game. It doesn't change the fact that I can make shit up, change things and that what we say and do during the game is of prime importance, but having that structured framework to support play makes it better for me, personally. <br/><br/>3. Interactions between subsystems. If the rules say, for example, "give out xp at the end of the adventure" and there's no clear definition of adventure then it basically becomes "give out xp whenever", but maybe there's a reason why the rules say at the end of the adventure. If I don't like that reason I can still change things, right? Having specific instructions is not limiting to me any more than lacking them. I think a lot of the problems that later editions of D&amp;D have came about precisely because people didn't head the instructions of the original games, ran into problems and tried to fix them.<br/><br/>In a way that's obviously awesome. Experimenting and changing things around is an essential part of what we do. But when people say stuff like "You can't do anything in 4E except use your powers." that's obviously a not a problem with playing the game as instructed but playing the game against instruction. It's your own fault.<br/><br/>4. The challenge. There's a challenge in trying to play a game "as intended". Post death of the author and deconstruction that's obviously a vain attempt, but it doesn't mean it's not challenging. There's a thrill in trying to follow the written word as literally as possible, it's an exploration of system, trying to find out where it works out and where it breaks down. While 85% of my DMing in years past has been "let's play the way we like and use these books just as a platform", I definitely enjoy trying to stick to the books. Call it research if you want. You play exactly how the book says and then you see how right or how wrong it goes and you learn something new.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_371098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371098/#Comment_371098" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T03:09:57+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  3:09AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2012 3:14AM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any game is an instruction on the practice of playing that particular game.

Hope I'm on the same page as you.<br/><br/>Your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> are the big ones for me. The instruction manual sort of setup is helpful to me in telling you what your game is supposed to be, how you intend for it to be played and how that way differs from how you play other games. The lines in AW/DW about how you're not supposed to plan an adventure beforehand are a good example in my mind - this is something different about these games from many others, and you need to know that since the game isn't built to function at full capacity if you violate the instruction. It's something that even veteran roleplayers may need to know since the game is different from many others.<br/>Should games be made so that they only provide instructions for things that are specifically different or special about a game though? Essentially, should we go with what Zak said and simply presume that they know what they're doing? I think Don't Rest Your Head does this, right? It says up front that it's going to generally assume you're familiar with RPGs and then proceeds to provide instruction for what makes the game different. The super-mainstreams, the current editions of D&amp;D and such, can't presume that since a large part of their goal is to bring people in who AREN'T familiar with the game. However, I think that a lot of our more "specialist" games have an opportunity to ignore that instruction manual feel. In my mind right now I'm seeing Ghost/Echo - it's a page of setting inspiration and a page of rules, with very little instruction.<br/><br/>And you mention the "You can't do anything in 4e except use your powers" thing. I know this is against the explicit instructions, but is it possible that the way that the entire game is built in terms of powers (not just class specific ones, but skill powers and even simple things like the basic melee/ranged and bull rush and grapple) is carrying a contradictory implicit instruction that you ARE only supposed to use powers? The general standard 4e public seems to have zeroed in on using just powers a lot of the time and thinking in those terms, so it's strange to think that none of them caught the explicit instruction and are going with a potentially much stronger IMPLICIT instruction? If so, how do you solve something like that, reconcile that contradiction. I mean, people who read carefully won't fall into that implicit instruction, do you just need to make that explicit instruction harder to overlook?<br/>This bit is sort of off-topic though, I think the point of this thread is more talking about explicit instructions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment"

Now we're alternating <i>Spirit of the Century</i> with <i>Bushido</i>. And they don't get <i>Spirit of the Century</i> and grumble that it doesn't work properly\u2014because they expect it to do something that it isn't meant to do. (It doesn't help particularly that half of them won't read it, but depend on others to read it and tell them how the systems work.)<br/><br/>I think that this is quite important for Story Games. Not only might any of them be picked up by a novice roleplayer, but any of them might be picked up by a gamer with a background in GM-dominated resolution-based games.<br/><br/><br/>Another thing is that a game lacking instructions is incomplete, this might be an aesthetical consideration rather than a practical one. It's like painting the tops of architraves. I never look at the tops of architraves except perhaps when I am on a ladder changing a light bulb, but it annoys me every time I dust one if they aren't painted, because they just ought to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371142/#Comment_371142" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T07:32:37+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  7:32AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Since the instructions<i>in any one of them</i>could just as well apply<i>to all of them,</i>I didn't see why an experience GM/player would like the instruction-containing one more than the others.</blockquote>\nI don't think that's true.

I stand by that statement in the context of OSR games. Each plays a bit differently, and so it's useful to me to have each actually tell me how to play.<br/><br/>Take Lamentations of the Flame Princess and Adventurer, Conqueror, King. In Lamentations I'm told to not use stock monsters (there are none in the book). It's a game of weird fantasy with some horror and mystery, so that makes sense. In Adventurer, Conqueror, King, there's an encyclopedia of beasts ready to be used and I'm expected to make use of them (and the players are expected to gain some familiarity with them). If I use stock monsters with LotFP it may work just fine, but from what the author says and what I see in the rules it seems like it could end up pretty boring. It's useful for me to know the default so that I can at least know when I'm going beyond what the game was designed for.<br/><br/>In reverse, ACKS tells me to set up a fantastic world in which the players can grow to a role of power. Lamentations tells me to make a largely "real" world where the players will, if they're lucky, accumulate some small power. If my ACKS world doesn't have multiple cities and regions and so on a lot of the rules for, say, running a Thieves' Guild fall a little flat.<br/><br/>Stretching a bit to the edges of OSR, Moldvay tells me to run adventures that cover the moment they enter the dungeon to when they leave and divvy up treasure. Stars Without Number would be sorely lacking if I only covered the adventure part, the larger game of managing factions and ships is a huge part of why that game rocks. (Moldvay is certainly not Renaissance and SWN is not fantasy, so take them or leave them, but they're both in that style and are great games.) <br/><br/>There are plenty of instructions to one OSR game that wouldn't apply to another OSR game. And, even if two games do share a lot of the same instructions, I don't know that until they both include those instructions. So I'd prefer to have that text in the game. It's useful to me.<br/><br/>There are, as other people have mentioned, a ton of other reasons too: they make it easier to hand to someone else, they give me insight into what's in the designer's head, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371147/#Comment_371147" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T07:54:37+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  7:54AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2012 7:58AM by sage.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ndp</cite>What else would they be?</blockquote>\nA collection of procedures for resolving specific tasks.<br/><br/>In the original context I was talking about bits of Moldvay that actually lay down procedures of play, like adventures starting with the players entering the dungeon and the DM then telling them what they see. The game that doesn't tell you <i>at all</i> how to play is probably a straw man, but I'm thinking of the difference between, say, Lamentations of the Flame Princess and Into the Odd. (No slight against Into the Odd, it's still a short playtest document so it's totally excusable that it doesn't give very clear procedures yet.) Lamentations clearly tells me as the GM what to do and how to do it, Into the Odd has a few gems of advice but otherwise leaves me to my own devices.<br/><br/>The original context was "why do you love OSR games?" This style of actual instructions on how to play is something I see a lot more in OSR games than many of RPGs. DC Adventures, for example, gives me less instruction on how to actually run a superhero adventure than LotFP does on how to run a weird fantasy game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371148/#Comment_371148" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T07:56:17+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  7:56AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also nice when a game tells you what it's for.<br/><br/><i>take yourself back to 1996....</i><br/>AD&amp;D session 1:<br/>- gnome fighter wanders around, gets into a couple of fights with wandering monsters.<br/><br/>AD&amp;D session 2:<br/>- gnome fighter and half-elf druid team up, get into a fight with a boar.<br/><br/>We sort of had fun, but we got the feeling that, without buying a module, we weren't playing it "right".

A lot of people wear no belt. Some groups require all players to wear a belt. Others don't care, but do care about your jacket and tie. Some like to let their pants hang lower than their hips. Others prefer a waist line above the belly button. Others hate the idea of pants entirely and mostly wear shorts or skirts or nothing at all.<br/><br/>Or maybe it's a bad metaphor. Pretty much everyone past the age of 5 knows how to wear pants. And even though it took most of us 4 or more years of almost daily practice - first wearing pants then putting them on - we consider it an easy task. I don't see how that relates to gaming at all, except to imply that people who want instructions for games are not as competent as a five year old who can dress herself.<br/><br/>Gaming is a complex skillset. A lot of people have used algebra, but I don't trust that everyone I meet could do so with proficiency. A chess set without instructions would be considered defective by many, though you could play it. What about a chessboard with checker pieces? What if it included pieces that are completely unfamiliar? Is it still like chess? Would an instruction manual telling you the basics of how to move pieces be useless?<br/><br/>A card deck without instructions is just a tool. Am I going to play poker or hearts? Maybe I can trust that a person knowns that hearts and more valuable than clubs. But what about aces over kings? What about these Joker cards? What's the numberical value of the Queen and does it matter?<br/><br/>The ways to play on chess boards or use a deck of cards are pretty varied. But the possibilities of the ways to play a roleplaying game are moreso. Heck, the definition of what defines a roleplaying game is cause for contention. That's still true even if you are limiting your scope to "old school" games. <br/><br/>With all that in mind, why wouldn't you want an instruction manual as your game text? What would that accomplish? What are the benefits? What does that mean about the audience? Where do you draw the line on elements that are too basic to go over? Is it worthwhile to provide a reference for concepts not covered in the book just in case?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lantern314" title="lantern314"><img alt="lantern314" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lantern314">lantern314</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371478/#Comment_371478" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T14:55:13+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  2:55PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like my experience of reading Ars Magica 4th edition and coming away with a better sense of what happens between adventures than what happens in an adventure fits here.
