Whenever people talk about Sorcerer being too dark or think the game is about reveling in depravity I point to this setting I came up with the first time someone asked about lighter Sorcerer.  I would love it if someone played it.  Bonus points for playing it with actual children.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>Sorcerers are children on the cusp of adulthood.  I would say the core age range being 12 to 15 but could see going as low as 10 and as high as 18.  At least one element of the character should represent their move from the care free days of childhood into a more adult role in the lives of others around them.  A 12 year old with a new baby sibling is a good example.<br/><br/>Demons are fairies.  Feel free to pull from the full range of folk lore from mischievous household sprites to burly trolls.  In general bound fairies protect and help their \u201cmasters\u201d while probably causing lots of trouble.  Mischief and Mayhem are common Desires.  Knowledge a close second.<br/><br/>Sorcery is rooted in childish and irresponsible behavior.  Summoning a fairy might involve stealing your mother\u2019s favorite antique tea cup, filling it with honey and burying it in the mud.  Binding might be done via challenging the fairy to ever escalating dangerous dares (climbing a high tree perhaps?).  Banish, Punish and Contain are of course the opposite.  Shutting that window and going to bed like you\u2019re supposed to could be the basis for a Punish or Contain, for example.<br/><br/>Humanity is the ability to handle adult responsibility.  You lose humanity when you act childishly, irresponsibly or selfishly.  You gain humanity when you take responsibility for your actions, accept consequences and generally behave like an adult.  At zero humanity you are forever a child emotionally, never really to take on the world and its challenges as an adult.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159982/#Comment_159982" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T20:05:14+00:00" title="July 30, 2008  8:05PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/>\n  That is great!<br/>\n  Its so simple, and seems like it would work great!<br/>\n  Now, I'll have to actually buy Sorcerer.<br/>\n  Thank you so much!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159985/#Comment_159985" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T20:30:47+00:00" title="July 30, 2008  8:30PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            wow, that's really lovely.<br/><br/>thanks for the idea!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159993/#Comment_159993" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T21:22:24+00:00" title="July 30, 2008  9:22PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, so you get to act childish, irresponsible, and selfish <i>and</i> you get to hang out with fairies?

I'd like this seriously answered, myself. What's the counter-motivation--the push-pull--that encourages (systematically) rejection of the fae and accepting adulthood.<br/><br/>Maybe that's why the Humanity has to ratchet up, as you become more adult? Is there sufficient "draw" from increased Humanity, in the game, to offset the attraction of having faeries to do one's bidding? Or would it be on the GM to make the faeries at least as troublesome as helpful (more like demons, basically)?<br/><br/>Curiouser and curiouser....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160064/#Comment_160064" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T10:11:41+00:00" title="July 31, 2008 10:11AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2008 10:13AM by Jesse.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's very common for people to react with surprise to my Humanity definition.  They're used to the idea of Innocence that gets lost as the child transitions into adulthood.  I really dislike this idea because it makes every story about childhood a tragedy.  The Innocence interpretation of Humanity is also antithetical to Sorcerer's design as Innocence is often portrayed as something that can be force-ably taken away and Humanity in Sorcerer is all about what the character *chooses* to do.  The example scenario in Sorcerer's Soul that uses Innocence as a Humanity definition actually does break this rule and its never sat well with me.<br/><br/>So what's the incentive?  I get to be irresponsible AND play with fairies!  Cool, huh?  What's the down side?<br/><br/>Yes, the fairies are meant to be troublesome and destructive via their playfulness.<br/><br/>That's why the real world relationships of the Sorcerer are about a thousand times more important in this setting.  How much fun is it to see your mother crying when she finds out you've lost the teacup that was the last memory of HER mother?

In a "normal" game if Humanity is Love or anything else, and someone says "So what, who cares about love if it means I can get what I want?" That's when the GM reponds with. "Oh really?

They ARE the demons of this setting.  That's why this is not an "alternative" Sorcerer game.  This is an *application* of Sorcerer.  But that's a subtle point, no need to dwell on it.  Everything remains the same, yes, including Needs and Desires.  And yes, the needs can be childish.  I like your suggestion of "attention" A LOT.

In the case of kid Sorcerers this might be analogous to staying up very, very late or traveling into a very dangerous area.  \u201cHits\u201d of the drug map onto, perhaps, hours stayed up or miles traveled.  Like drug use, when the Contact ritual is over the Sorcerer rolls the number of dice added against an appropriate stat (Will for staying up late, Stamina for traveling, etc) and if the stat fails then that stat is impeded for a period of time and permanently if the \u201cdrug dice\u201d scored Total Victory.<br/><br/>Sacrificing &amp; Summoning: It isn\u2019t likely that ten year old Sorcerers are going to be spilling the blood of their baby brothers in the name of the goblin king.  To that end here are two different takes on sacrificing for purposes of gaining dice on Summoning rituals.<br/><br/>The first method is using sacrificing with the possibility of retrieval. The idea here is that whatever is being sacrificed is not killed but simply given over to the demon and possibly whisked away to the Otherworld.  Mechanically this works identically to the method described in the core book.  This is still a very dangerous option because there are no guarantees in Sorcerer.  Just because it\u2019s possible to get back whatever was sacrificed doesn\u2019t mean it will be.  Also, this option tends to take over the story very quickly as turning over one\u2019s baby brother to the goblin king is rather a big deal.<br/><br/>The second method involves sacrificing an item of emotional importance to someone who is not the Sorcerer.  Rather than sacrificing his baby brother, the Sorcerer can sacrifice his baby brother\u2019s teddy bear.  Mechanically the item owner\u2019s Humanity is rolled vs. the Sorcerer\u2019s own Humanity and the victories are rolled into the Summoning roll.  This roll is subject to all the usual role-playing bonuses with the dice being added onto the owner\u2019s Humanity pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395072/#Comment_395072" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T12:48:26+00:00" title="October 27, 2012 12:48PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My notes on how to handle adults:<br/><br/>Adults function thematically different across different kinds of stories.  As such it is worth giving them some special consideration.  Here are some options.<br/><br/>Thematically Active \u2013 Adults are present and active in the narrative and are not treated in any special way other than the normal thematic considerations of the material.  <br/><br/>Thematically Absent \u2013 The story concerns only kid-to-kid interaction and the adult world is presented only in vague and shadowy terms.  Adults and their actions have no meaningful impact on the narrative and adult life seems far off, confusing and inaccessible to the main characters.  Characters tend to talk about interactions with adults only in terms of their life functions, \u201cMom and Dad went to a party last night,\u201d or \u201cMy teacher said I\u2019m not trying hard enough.\u201d<br/><br/>Thematically Skewed \u2013 Adults are present and active in the narrative but are thematically weighted in some manner.  One such weighting might be that all adult characters are either antagonistic or ineffectual.  Another weighting might simply be that all adults automatically gain two bonus dice in any conflict with children characters.  This lends adult characters more of an authoritarian presence in the fiction.<br/><br/>A super scary option would be to treat adults like Angels from Sorcerer's Soul.  They have no Will score because they can't be influenced by children.  They have a Grace score because they help children grow up.  They have a Goal because they want their children to become something greater than they are.<br/><br/>In addition to the above some attention needs to be given to how adults relate to the Mentor Descriptor for Lore.  The basic setup assumes that functional members of adult society are non-Sorcerers.  To that end it is recommended that having an adult sorcerous mentor implies that such a character is, at least initially, an outcast in the adult world.  The creepy hermit who lives alone in the woods, the lonely janitor at school everyone avoids, or that great aunt no one\u2019s talked to in almost a generation are all good examples.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395073/#Comment_395073" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T12:55:06+00:00" title="October 27, 2012 12:55PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And finally some cute, cuddly little demons<br/><br/>Mug<br/><br/>Type:  Passer<br/>Appearance: <br/>Mug is a goblin bundled up in clothing to appear more like a squat, stocky boy.
