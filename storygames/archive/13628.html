I know of a bunch of good options for six players, and I'm familiar with the suggested variations in the basic rules, but those seem clunky.<br/><br/>I can't find any reliable resource for well-tested variants of Diplomacy, and it sounds like they're not easy to design. Eero posted an interesting account of the Five Italies map, and how it didn't work too well: which makes sense, a certain asymmetry makes the game much more interesting.<br/><br/>So, I have two questions:<br/><br/>1. Can you get a shorter game simply by reducing the number of SCs that must be owned by the winner? I don't really see why not, but surely someone's tried that and actually knows whether it works or not.<br/><br/>2. It seems to me that you could develop some variations simply by cutting off chunks of the map. It takes careful thinking, but doesn't seem impossible or anything.<br/><br/>I'll try below, just for illustration:                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307922/#Comment_307922" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T12:51:57+00:00" title="January 12, 2011 12:51PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2011 1:06PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, for four players, we could make a map like this (sorry, it's sloppy, but I don't have time to make it pretty):<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/FourPlayer.gif"/><br/><br/>The players would be England, France, Germany, and Italy, of course.

A lot of the countries have interesting choices to make at the beginning of the game. Ideally, there would be some way for Italy to grab Greece in the Fall of 1901 as well, maybe by repositioning one of Italy's starting units or something like that. Heck, maybe in this variation Italy would be in enough trouble that she would need to start with four units, as Russia does in standard Diplomacy.<br/><br/>What do you think?

The method recommended in the rules-text is to leave certain Powers unplayed, with units on the board; I've personally witnessed only the six-player version (with Italy left neutral), as we usually much prefer playing a given board with a full complement of players. In most situations I end up playing Diplomacy we will rather pass on the game altogether than play without a full complement; because of this I'm quite interested in high-quality variants for alternate number of players - I'd need to have something that is basically as well-designed as the default map for it to be credible around here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308262/#Comment_308262" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T14:13:11+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  2:13PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, what do you think of these easy and simple variations?

The territory geometry is reasonable and the game tends to balance itself. It's good enough for pick-up play, I imagine.<br/><br/>I'm not personally too interested, but that's mostly because I don't see the point in a quick variant map; I'd rather download a flavourful and ambitious variant map specifically designed for the purpose. (I'd recommend the <a href="http://www.variantbank.org/" rel="nofollow">Variant Bank</a> here, but it appears to be down at the moment.) It does seem that there is some demand for quick-and-dirty ways of playing Diplomacy with less players, of course, as can be seen in the relatively popularity of the various variants that use the basic map in different ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308292/#Comment_308292" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T16:17:17+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  4:17PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the idea is that using the Calhamer map, if we do it in an intelligent way, might allow us to preserve the built-in balance of that map.

Taking a part of the board is useful in preserving tactical relationships, though; a common weakness of variant maps is when the map is not locally interesting - the local relationships between territories are not concominant of tactically interesting and heterogenous play situations. That's the sort of thing you get help for by using a pre-existing map as a template.<br/><br/>How many players are you considering? One reason for why variants are challenging is that seven players is actually a pretty nice number for the game insofar as the diplomacy is concerned, so a variant will have to account for the lessened diplomatic depth if there are fewer players. Three players, for example, is probably not playable as more than a tactical exercise (that is, the players have to agree in advance to limited diplomacy or entirely relegate diplomacy outside the sphere of the game, or otherwise the game won't resolve due to the vested interest everybody has in not allowing the strongest opponent to win).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308317/#Comment_308317" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T18:41:22+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  6:41PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points, Eero.

Play until the end of 1908, for example, and then count the SCs, with the largest Power winning the game. That probably works better than setting a low winning SC count, as it doesn't change the end-game logic as dramatically.<br/><br/>I'm not too fond of the artificially shortened game, as the truncated end-game tends to reflect on the nature of the whole enterprise. It's not that far-fetched to say that the relatively common over-aggressive game-style we have here in Finland has largely developed because a majority of the games is played in tournament form; blindly attacking the weakest point in enemy lines makes only too much sense when you know that the game's going to end in four rounds, after which the player with the most SCs will win, no matter their strategic or diplomatic position.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308545/#Comment_308545" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T10:43:21+00:00" title="January 17, 2011 10:43AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm!<br/><br/>Well, playing for a smaller SC count could prevent some of those unwanted effects, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308552/#Comment_308552" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T11:21:54+00:00" title="January 17, 2011 11:21AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, but it has its own weirdnesses. I do admit that my approach towards the game is pretty staid and serious, so what is a weakness to a variant in my book might be just what somebody else would like to have.<br/><br/>As a point of interest, in case you didn't know: the theoretical justification for the otherwise arbitrary winning SC count in the game is that 18 SCs represents a majority of the available territory on the Calhamer board. The logic is that anybody able to dominate that much of the board would, given time, be able to conquer the rest as well. Thus the usual, often unsaid variant victory requirement is always half of whatever is the given board's SC count. Not an argument against alternative victory conditions, but a sort of aesthetic game design justification for the default rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308560/#Comment_308560" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T13:03:46+00:00" title="January 17, 2011  1:03PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, I'd figured as much.<br/><br/>What kind of weirdness might you expect to see with a different victory condition, such as a reduced number of SCs owned to win the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308563/#Comment_308563" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T13:28:41+00:00" title="January 17, 2011  1:28PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Merely guessing at it, I'd expect good players to play much more conservatively if the SC limit was lower. Consequently individual Powers would not be eliminated as easily, and players would be more inclined to drop whatever they were doing to turn against a dominant Power. End-game concerns would not exist, as the end-game itself would not exist; victory would be determined locally, as a given player would have the ability to achieve the winning SC count without having to go to a full-board end-game. You could basically lose the game without ever having an opportunity to challenge the winner if you happened to play on different parts of the board. Mid-game strategy would likely be much more aggressive, as you wouldn't have to worry about the board positions during end-game if you could just finish the game by attacking and conquering one of your neighbours.<br/><br/>Nothing on that list outright ruins the game, so I guess I wouldn't be averse to trying out a lower SC limit as a lark, although I would rather play with the normal limit if given the choice. Considering the Calhamer map, an interesting experimental limit could be 10 SCs - it'd be high enough to not be achieved entirely accidentally, but so low that it can be achieved in middle-game easily enough. I suspect that the overall game experience would be less loose and more paranoid, with everybody watching each other's moves carefully; whoever managed to get a decisive upper hand against a neighbour would be immediately on the brink of overall victory. Interesting as a curiousity, surely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308564/#Comment_308564" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T13:54:12+00:00" title="January 17, 2011  1:54PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with you on all that!<br/><br/>It's worth a try, I think... hopefully if anyone does, they'll post here.<br/><br/>I will if I get a chance, for sure.<br/><br/>Also, note that "10" is pretty low limit, as you say, and could potentially be reached quite quickly (although I've never seen that happen yet, as a player), but there is a lot of room between "10" and "18". A limit of 13 or 14, for instance, might be interesting. Definitely changes the game, though.<br/><br/>I think it would make for fewer draws/ties, which could be a feature.
