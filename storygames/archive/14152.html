I worked for a few years in a homeless shelter in one of the highest heroin and meth usage areas in North America and have seen all sorts of things in person that I think the typical person would do a pretty terrible job of replicating.<br/><br/>The times I've had a mental health system actual work in play have been very few in number.  They usually involved the player having very specific instructions about what their character is experiencing rather than giving them a label/diagnosis.  For example, in Call of Cthulhu, the guy running it would never mention the name of a given disorder, but instead give a description of symptoms as they occurred. <br/><br/>So in a game where your character's mental health can degrade, what's the best way to handle it?  Don't Rest Your Head has it pop up right out of the resolution mechanic when madness dominates the result and must be included in the narration that results.<br/><br/>But what I'm talking about here is more for the games where mental health problems are more like damage that you take.  Like Sanity in Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>I'm contemplating making a deck of cards that have very specific symptoms on them.  For example, a deck focused on paranoia and delusions might be called "Secrets" and have paranoid and delusional information on them.<br/><br/>If you were playing a game and your character went through a horrific experience and cracked, would you find a card that said "They can hear your thoughts" would that be enough to run with and produce something worthwhile?  Is that better than getting a general description of what a paranoid delusion is?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321039/#Comment_321039" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T23:26:46+00:00" title="April 17, 2011 11:26PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried to model this as a GM once. One of the characters was paranoid and I had a short discussion with the other players beforehand.<br/>During play, I'd have NPCs whisper things to the other players about the paranoid character or have him see things that didn't really happen. But since everyone was playing along, character and player knowledge was the same.<br/><br/>Like say NPC1 goes ''OK let's go, leave Jack here, he's useless anyway.''<br/>PC goes ''Yeah, he's been dead weight for weeks now.''<br/><br/>In the game fiction, this didn't actually happen. I thought it was funny how ''Jack'' ignored it at first. He finally snapped at them and the scene played out almost exactly as you'd expect it to. No one knew what the hell he was talking about, but he was so angry about it that he couldn't figure out the ''trick''.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321048/#Comment_321048" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T01:43:06+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  1:43AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2011 1:43AM by Dave Hallett.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some interesting techniques for handling this in Trail of Cthulhu, e.g. to simulate amnesia, the player of the character in question leaves the room, while everyone has a quick discussion and decides upon something that now happened in the past, such as the character having written a book, that going forward they simply refer to as fact. Or they change the character's name without telling the player, etc.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, however, I think it's a mistake to conflate the 'insanity' of Lovecraft with modern-day mental illness. That's not to say that isn't fertile ground for some games, but I'm doubtful that its genre-appropriate for Cthulhu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_321060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321060/#Comment_321060" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T05:01:01+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  5:01AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2011 5:08AM by The_Magus.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is pretty tricky.  My understanding of 'Don't Rest Your Head' is that Madness confers special abilities so I wouldn't really conceive of it as madness in its regular sense.  If anyone has played a fantasy PC that rushes into battle to slay for honour you could argue that he is insane and recklessly endangering himself (apology for gender stereotype).  My experience with Call and Trail of Cthulhu is that Insanity effective writes the character off or makes them less playable.<br/><br/>My take on mental illness is that it is a 'best' response to the circumstance.  In CoC I conceive of the insane as being severely traumatised by encountering something dreadful.  The thoughts of the character then become such that if there is any way in which thge recollection of this trauma can be avoided it will be.<br/><br/>I think the last CoC rulebook I had was second edition and I recall a list of mental illnesses.  I felt that at that point the PC became an NPC and could be described as behaving in a certain way.  I remember being at a con a couple of years back and having a guy who had kleptomania.  All he did was stick various bits and pieces into his pockets but there was very little "why" about this behaviour.  Why fend off a trauma in this way?<br/><br/>Additionally the various lists of mental illnesses can be a bit unhelpful.  No-one these days would use the term kleptomaniac or agoraphobic.  Anxiety disorder is the new mantra.  Also definitions of illness have changed - borderline personality has emerged from under the shadow of schizophrenia.  The US and the rest of the world have slight differences on how to categorise borderline personality disorder.  Homosexuality is no longer a mental illness.<br/><br/>Playing a mentally ill character raises some interesting conundrums once you get past the PC as 'insane psycho' or 'useless NPC.'  I think it's fine for a player's character to say "I'm Napoleon, I am" but why are they doing that?  Why be Napoleon?  Why not Jesus?   What is the payoff in being this way?  This will I'm sure having the effect of increasing inter-party tensions - it's going to be difficult to get where you're going to with someone who now has a very different agenda.<br/><br/>This reminds me of the conundrum in Catch-22.  You have to be insane to fly a bombing mission but realising you are doing something insane gives you insight and therefore means you are not insane.  Maybe RPGs could evolve into grea existential debates - I've not got a problem with this but it might be annoying if your remit is to pwn lots of bad guys.<br/><br/>"That's some catch, that Catch 22."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321078/#Comment_321078" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T10:00:23+00:00" title="April 18, 2011 10:00AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2011 10:02AM by frozenwastes.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are all some excellent points.  I have realized though, that a mental health mechanic is not what I want in the game I'm planning on running.  I'm chucking out the mental health aspect and replacing it with bonuses for victimizing others.   The downward spiral in the game is more about lack of empathy and the mental health rules in the game don't really belong there in the first place.<br/><br/>Thanks for everyone's input and for helping me realize I was barking up the wrong tree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321343/#Comment_321343" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-20T11:25:03+00:00" title="April 20, 2011 11:25AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That being said, I think the "symptom deck" is a potentially interesting way to handle mental breakage. I think there's some potential there.<br/><br/>The symptom deck would let you give more of a justification for the symptoms. Like<br/><br/>"There's no way they could have known you would do that. They must be able to hear your thoughts."<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"That looks useful. If you'd had that when that bad thing happened, you would have been ok. Hey, that looks useful too..."<br/><br/>I like the idea of guiding the player toward a specific broken thought pattern that they could make use of in their characterization.<br/><br/>But I'm up in the air as to whether it should be something randomly assigned. Because it would become an important part of the character. I think you'd only want the character to have one aspect like that, and it would be dialed up or down depending on how "in control" they were.<br/><br/>If the klepto is ok, he's just occasionally grabbing something. But if he breaks down, he starts hoarding everything he can get his hands on until he recovers.<br/><br/>When the "hear my thoughts" person breaks down, they put on a tinfoil hat and start looking for a lead lined room to hide out in, where they won't be able to hear her mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
