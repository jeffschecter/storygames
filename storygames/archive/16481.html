It's always been a part of gaming culture, of course - but it seems to me that it's been really growing for the past few years. People take a game, do cool stuff with it (new setting, interesting design changes), and put it out there for others to play with.<br/><br/>Recently, through my Matthijs-colored glasses, I see people being even more loose with it, just taking bits and pieces from different games and transplanting them into/combining them with other games: Taking oracles out of IAWA and using them with completely different games; using ritual phrases with miniatures; taking half of Taste For Murder and mixing it with LARP techniques.<br/><br/>If a hack is a remix, where you base the new thing on the structure/wholeness of the old thing (revisioning or maybe even perverting the original), it seems to me we're moving into sampling now, where we pick little things from many places and recombine them into something completely different. And we're not doing it to write a whole new game text - we're doing it for a one-shot, for our local group. This particular mix, from this particular DJ, will be played at this party and never heard again - but it will inspire people who hear about it, and live on as a memory and a new style to be sampled for someone else's mix.<br/><br/>This familiarity with, and playful attitude towards to, many different techniques is wonderful. While I love a well-thought-out game that has been playtested and tweaked and is just perfect, I also love, love, love the sessions where we go "tonight I want to try something different - I'm gonna hack your hack with another hack I found, I have no idea what happens!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377249/#Comment_377249" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T00:18:48+00:00" title="May  9, 2012 12:18AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of my best gaming experiences have in common a kind of feeling of playing outside the rules - of going into unexplored territory.

Embody the characters. Use simple props. Also, use the space and movement to represent the emotional elements of play."<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"<i>Whispered</i><br/>Give suggestions of what to do, how they might feel, act, react. Through a quiet whisper in the ear, or low suggestion audible by all."<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"<i>Locked eyes</i><br/>Players maintain direct eye contact with one another as long as possible while playing out scene. Heightens awareness of the other person\u2019s reactions. May put pressure on players to focus intently. Can be used as trigger for other technique or new action if someone drops their eyes."<br/><br/>Playing with Intent is simply a system that calls attention to the specific techniques underpinning a lot of jeepform and freeform games, so that we can use them for hacking any kind of game we want... sometimes in the spur of the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377277/#Comment_377277" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T07:00:23+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  7:00AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I do this, but...<br/>I love keying in to what makes a game special, and focusing on that thing while I'm playing it.

Ghost/Echo and Lady Blackbird come to mind, because I hang out with that John Harper guy pretty often. I actually played in a full-on hack of The Riddle of Steel for warring states-era Japan in Boston that will probably never be formally released in any form; the GM just put together this 80+ page document for a single campaign. My sense is there are hundreds of those hacks out there, developed by GMs and then never even talked about or released on the internet; that's just how many folks approach "campaign design."<br/><br/>Personally, I like the "sampling" technique as a way to sketch out a game concept and try to play it, similar to what people do with "playstorming" but with solo design, just trying to make something playable as soon as possible, rather than waiting until you've figured out how the game will work. Brendan Adkins seems like a pro at this, since he does this thing where he runs games that haven't been finished or released yet, just based on whatever hints and tidbits are available. He ran "Danger Patrol Gamma" this way at a convention a while back and directly influenced the development of Pocket Danger Patrol. Super awesome and inspiring. I feel like I'm just now getting to the point where my design chops and GMing instincts are solid enough that I could do that kind of thing and have it turn out successfully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377279/#Comment_377279" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T07:42:30+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  7:42AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Right now I was just finishing another step in my design, which is a system to hack games.<br/>I conceptualized that everything in a character sheet is just resources the player has to interact with the fiction and that they could be organized in 6 types of choices:<br/><br/>Attack: everything your character has or does that is able to harm an opponent directly and/or damage inert objects.<br/>Protection: anything your character uses to protect herself or others, including things as armor and healing skills/powers.<br/>Movement: an skill or ability your character can use to gain positional advantage, avoid damage or flee.<br/>Discovery: any skill, ability, source of information, etc. that either allows the character to access a particular hidden information or allows the player to add some minor input on a scene.<br/>Interaction: any skill, ability or quirk the character uses to interact with other characters and influence them in a particular way.<br/>Aid/interfere: anything your character uses to ... yes by now you problably have realized these come from AW's basic moves and that you can actually classify any other moves in the book in these categories.<br/><br/>For what purpose? well, for one thing this categorization allows a better balance of abilities/skills/kewl powers, since the player won't get for free one resource that can be used on every kind of situation. It solves many more issues than that but you get the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377309/#Comment_377309" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T11:28:54+00:00" title="May  9, 2012 11:28AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just like a lot of the concepts I see in games, but I have a very strong anti-GM agenda, so I try and stretch genres or rules to cover what my group at the time seems interested in.<br/><br/>I often claim I'm using "FUDGE" if people are wary of story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377326/#Comment_377326" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T12:18:33+00:00" title="May  9, 2012 12:18PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I create systems to make GMing easier in the games I run.

Do you have a conversion process you give people, or do your orient people towards which parts of game to work with or port over?<br/><br/>I've got a conversion process that cathegorizes all player options into 6 kinds of actions (hacked/inspired/remixed from the AW basic moves)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite><br/>Attack: everything your character has or does that is able to harm an opponent directly and/or damage inert objects.<br/>Protection: anything your character uses to protect herself or others, including things as armor and healing skills/powers.<br/>Movement: an skill or ability your character can use to gain positional advantage, avoid damage or flee.<br/>Discovery: any skill, ability, source of information, etc. that either allows the character to access a particular hidden information or allows the player to add some minor input on a scene.<br/>Interaction: any skill, ability or quirk the character uses to interact with other characters and influence them in a particular way.<br/>Aid/interfere: anything your character uses to help or interfere with the actions or other characters<br/></blockquote>\nSo it works only for games that use the approach of defining a character by the set of options it has to interact with the fiction. The harder part are the mechanics and procedures from the original game that help convey the atmosphere the designer intended. For those I've to either add a similar mechanic designed to fit my system or add advice for the GM on how to achieve something close to it.<br/><br/>An early playtest worked using part of the concepts in Barbaren, in GMfull mode. Of course I doubt a Barbaren game would be totally alike the one we played, but we had quite a few of those "tongue-in-cheek" fun moments the author devised for his game. Still an earlier playtest failed to work with the medieval WoD setting and demands to be revisited with a generous tweak in the mechanics that help frame scenes and challenges, to make those more appropiate with the setting. Perhaps a single-GM approach would help here as well.<br/><br/>On a side note, I'm about to use it to clarify the "why D&amp;D monk seems to be broken?" issue I have. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377825/#Comment_377825" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T12:01:56+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 12:01PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry to bring up FUDGE, but it's what got me thinking about game mechanics at all in the Way Back When.
