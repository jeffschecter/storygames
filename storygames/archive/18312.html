Make sure everybody get the chance to speak</b><br/>You need some kind of pacing mechanism so even the more silent ones can get their share of the spot light. <b>Fiasco</b> and <b>Polaris</b> achieves this by rotating which character that has the spotlight moment. <b>This Is Pulp</b> does it by giving tokens to those who act, and the ones with the least amount of tokens are the ones who get to act next. It's a GM technique that I built as a game mechanic, where I always look to activate the least active player (a technique that backfires in <b>InSpectres</b>).<br/><br/><b>2. Make leading roles</b><br/>There are other things that the GM less games in general don't provide. They don't tell us who is getting the more important parts. I've been talking about this before, with passive, reactive and active relations (agendas) that creates token, supporting or leading roles. It doesn't matter if you got a bunch of relations to the other characters, which tells us that your character probably will be in most of the scenes, if the character is just a token that's moved around by others. The one who is organizing the game must be aware of this and, by either meta game or in-game methods, support the players that are in the risk zone of playing supporting or token parts.<br/><br/><b>3. Acknowledge each other by praising</b><br/>One mantra I learned as a soccer coach, and that I brought into my gaming sessions, was that I should have as a goal to praise every player at least once per session. It's important to acknowledge someone else by praising, both to enforce player behaviour but also to make the players feel that they contribute to the session. That they feel important. Very few games has this kind of support - and I'm not talking about giving XP or dice to other people for their ideas. It's not the same thing. I would say that no GM less games to my knowledge practise this.<br/><br/><b>4. Acknowledge each other by using their ideas</b><br/>Another way of acknowledging the others around the table is to take their ideas and make it part of the story. Some games does this, like all those games where the GM ask the others questions and make something out of it. But as you can tell, I had to write GM, because I've just seen one GM less game - <b>Bad Family</b> - do this successfully. The questions are actually the best part of the game. A game that only uses "Yes, and" and "Yes, but" without any kind of randomness would also acknowledge the participants' ideas.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>These are four guidelines that I think is really important in GM less games, when it comes to creating a creative environment so all players feel that they provides something to the session. I would dare to say that few GM less games support them, and the person organizing the games have to take care of this instead. A person who, by explaining all the rules, instantly gets a more important role around the table. That's something to take into consideration as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MrPurple" title="MrPurple"><img alt="MrPurple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MrPurple">MrPurple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412958/#Comment_412958" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T10:27:18+00:00" title="April 28, 2013 10:27AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could the leading role be linked to a "thread" in the story, or a location, person or even a time, the leading role's responsibility to provide impetus could be passed around depending on the involvement other components.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412960/#Comment_412960" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T11:25:11+00:00" title="April 28, 2013 11:25AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2013 11:25AM by zircher.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's an idea I never really thought of, and it's good thinking, but I think that few GM less games that, by themselves, enforce a behaviour that makes everybody speak up and therefore feel like equals.</blockquote>\nI'll shamelessly plug The Trouble with Rose which uses a round robin format so that everyone gets scene setting/narrative control.<br/><br/><a href="http://tangent-zero.com/trouble.htm" rel="nofollow">tangent-zero.com/trouble.htm</a><br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412964/#Comment_412964" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T12:49:16+00:00" title="April 28, 2013 12:49PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2013 12:54PM by johnzo.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The one who is organizing the game must be aware of this and, by either meta game or in-game methods, support the players that are in the risk zone of playing supporting or token parts.</blockquote>\nI think that the discovery of leading and supporting roles is a fine emergent property of story games.

(E.g. It's your turn to talk, everyone else must listen. Or: you have final say over this decision-making debate.) But they also:<br/>* Give that person a way to reach out for help, so they don't feel like they're put on the spot. Granting authority is important, but it must be tempered by some tools which allow that person to feel that they're not out there on a limb on their own. All that attention can be frightening!<br/>* Encourage other players to work with that player in a supporting role. This last one is maybe the trickiest! It's hard to be truly supportive and engaged without taking over the spotlight.<br/><br/>One example of the last category I really like is when the rules create incentives to interact with a player's role or character in the way that they like. For instance, Judd's game First Quest (unpublished) had "reverse Keys": you could choose a Key which would have criteria for other characters to fulfill. <br/><br/>A really good one for a shy player might be:<br/><br/>"Whenever someone follows one of my orders without question, they mark experience."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413036/#Comment_413036" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T06:32:03+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  6:32AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I <a href="http://wyrdcon.com/2011/wyrdconcompanionbook2012.pdf#page=24" rel="nofollow">wrote an article</a> that incorporates a lot of good play suggestions that will be relevant here, mostly stolen from John Stavropolous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413054/#Comment_413054" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T09:59:13+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  9:59AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2013 9:59AM by Rickard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Could the leading role be linked to a "thread" in the story, or a location, person or even a time, the leading role's responsibility to provide impetus could be passed around depending on the involvement other components.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure I understand what you mean.

Supporting roles aren't bad per se if the player wants to play one, but it would be nice to have everybody understand in an easy way what kind of roles that are in a game. I haven't analysed this enough, because I don't know if a game can exist by just having leading roles or if some are automatically turned into supporting or token roles.

Because if you give examples, you're taking one solution away from the player because that player would feel like a looser for using another player's idea. In other words: examples blocks the inspiration. Instead, <i>ask questions</i>. In tough cases, ask leading questions like "Didn't your mum say something about this?". Even if this is the same thing as giving example, the question itself leaves space for the player to say "no".

She was the quiet one and whenever she spoke up, everybody went silent out of respect, but it had almost the opposite effect instead. I usually handled the shy player by giving her her own sidetracks so I could cut to her sometimes to pick it up.

Haven't read the game. Can you tell me more about how it works?</blockquote>\nIt's a fairly classic amnesia game, GMless. The conceit is each character is taking part in a procedure to regain their memory, they have taken a drug that allows all four characters to share bits of memory and the other players have a better grip on relevant bits of the travelers memories.<br/><br/>So you all write memory triggers, one player is designated the traveler and pulls a random trigger (say, 'the name Susan carved on an old tree'), the other three players each ask a leading question which is actually a 'yes and' statement about the trigger.<br/><br/>With the platforming done by the 'yes and' questions the traveler goes on to describe the memory from that point and when they get to an action of consequence, because they can't remember it themselves, they ask two other players to remember it for them. They choose the one that is 'correct' and move on. The memory continues through steps, denoted by how many pennies the traveler has (you pass a penny to the player who gave you the 'correct' memory and add more in as the game continues so each memory will have more steps to it). When the traveler has no pennies left they have come to the end of the memory, take a penny and the next traveler is chosen. The mechanic for choosing a traveler means that it shares it around and almost favours the quieter players as they get to see more unfold while not being left behind.<br/><br/>In the standard 'skin' all the characters are normal people in a normal world and so the memories rarely link together. But there are options to play as cultists in a world with eldritch monsters or as spies in a Bourne Identity style mission gone wrong debrief within the book which would link the memories together much more (and make the experience less intense). The standard skin is almost always misery porn in the way it plays for some if not all of the stories.<br/><br/>It was written with a view to adding improv techniques to the core of the game, so is very heavily planted around the concept of 'yes anding' statements but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413176/#Comment_413176" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T06:28:51+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  6:28AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2013 6:31AM by Rickard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the elaboration.

It might be "when you follow that character's plans, you get a +1 to your roll", or "every time you frame a scene involving this character, you get one Story Token", or more specific connections like, "The Beast may only use his power of Fury when his love interest is in the scene" (and the love interest is the shy player).<br/><br/>The point is:<br/><br/>Since the shy player is not super likely to speak up themselves, it's great to have some kind of incentive which makes the <i>other players</i> want to include that player's character or input.<br/><br/>If I'm playing a game where survival is on the line, and we're in a tough a situation... but you get +1 when you follow the advice of the Wise One... I will never jump into danger before asking her, "Hey, hang on. What do YOU think we should do here?"<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
