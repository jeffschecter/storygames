I always find it to be too fiddly, too mechanical, and not grounded enough in the fiction. In D&amp;D, people create items just because they want to; in Mage, people can create magic items, but I can't for the life of me figure out why they would do so. Burning Wheel has a really cool crafting system, but the end result is still one step removed from the actual game fiction. Ars Magica has all its little tables of components and associations, which allow you to tailor your item to what's available at your power level, which is closer to what I want, but still not quite there. I wanted a crafting system where the making or recovery of items of power <i>was the story itself</i>. So I made one.<br/><br/>Here it is:<br/><br/>Artifact Builder v. 1.0<br/><br/>Naming<br/>Every good magic item needs a name. A name helps create a theme for the item, as well as possibly describing its powers or its history. Note that a name doesn't need to be totally descriptive, or even a little descriptive. Excalibur is a perfectly good name for a magic sword, as is Stormbringer.<br/><br/>History<br/>If you are crafting a new item, then don't worry about this step. You're creating history! If you're going to quest for one, then we need to know a little bit about it. Brainstorm a little, and try and get a sense of where the item came from, and how that might influence its abilities and its legend, and where it might be now.<br/><br/>Challenges<br/>It's not much of a quest if it's easy. Here's how we determine how many challenges an item needs before it can be crafted or recovered.<br/><br/>If you are crafting the item:<br/><br/>1.Is the item powerful? Give it a rating from 1 to 3, with 1 being a little better than normal (eg: a sword that can cut through steel), 2 being something with a few special effects (eg: a wand that can throw fireballs), and 3 being something world-altering or otherwise very serious (eg: a staff that can return the dark god to his prison). This is the Power rating.<br/>2.Is the item reusable? Some magic items are designed to accomplish a single task, and then are destroyed. Some can be used time and again, but only if a cost is paid each time. Some can be simply be wielded with no special cost associated. One-use items are rated 1, cost-per-use items are 2, and wielded items are 3. This is the Reuse rating.<br/>3.Is the item going to be common, rare, or unique? This is in terms of your game fiction. If the item's ability is going to be such that it can't be duplicated by any other item, either crafted or recovered, then that makes the item very important in the game fiction. If other items can have the same or very similar effects, then the item is still important, but less so. If an item is something that any powerful member of your game world should have, then that's still important, but it's saying something about your world. Common items are rated 1; rare items are rated 2, unique items are rated 3. This is the Rarity rating.<br/>4.Does the item have limitations on its use? Some magical tools can only be used by someone brave, or pure of heart, or of a certain lineage. Others can only be used if they are given freely. Some can be used by any fool who happens along them. If the item can be used by anyone, it is rated 1. If there are specific rules about its use, but more than one person might be eligible at a time under those rules (eg: anyone of a certain family line), then it is rated 2. If only one person at a time would be eligible (eg: only the One True King) then it is rated 3. This is the Limit rating.<br/><br/>Once you've answered all of these questions, have some other people in your group review it, and make sure their estimation of the values match yours. Then total the Power, Reuse, Rarity, and Limit values. This is the item's Crafting value.<br/><br/>If you are recovering the item:<br/><br/>1.Start by calculating the Crafting value as above, then subtract 5 from it. Any number lower than zero should be treated as zero. This is the item's Legend rating.<br/>2.Is the item lost? Often, magic items are lost to history, having disappeared when their last wielder died or vanished. If an item's location is known, then it is rated 1. If it is hinted at in legend and myth, then it is rated 2. If it has passed out of all knowledge, then it is rated 3. This is the Mystery rating.<br/>3.Is the item remote? Whether the PCs know it or not, the item must be somewhere if it is to be found. Some items are in the quester's proverbial backyard. Others are over seas and deserts. If the item is near, it is rated 1. If it is somewhere far away that isn't particularly difficult to get to, then it is rated 2. If it is in a remote, isolated, or hostile location, it is rated 3. This is the Remoteness rating.<br/>4.Is the item guarded? Artifacts are often found in old tombs, behind secret doors, or guarded by curses, cults, and killers. If there is no significant opposition to the item's recovery, then it is rated 1. If there are other treasure-hunters, minor curses, or simple guards and traps, or if the item can only be recovered under certain conditions (eg: only by a priest of a specific god), then it is rated 2. If the item is heavily-guarded, or under a great curse, or can only be recovered under very specific circumstances (eg: only on the first full moon of the year), then it is rated 3. This is the Protection rating.<br/><br/>Once you have answered all these questions, add the Legend, Mystery, Remoteness, and Protection ratings together. This is the item's Recovery value. Again, subject it to peer review.<br/><br/>If you are crafting an item, then you will need to go on quests to purify yourself and obtain the appropriate skills and components to do so. Take the item's Crafting rating and deal an equal number of cards from a standard deck (Jokers removed). Make a note of the suit and value of each card drawn. Spades will be combat challenges, Hearts are social challenges, Diamonds are knowledge challenges, and Clubs are environmental challenges. A-5 are minor challenges, 6-10 are major challenges, and face cards are epic challenges. Therefore, the Ace of Hearts would be a minor social challenge, the 8 of Spades would be a major combat challenge, and the King of Diamonds would be an epic knowledge challenge.<br/><br/>In order to craft the item, the players must frame scenes in which they are pursuing specific pieces of knowledge or components, then either the GM or another player may introduce a challenge from the required list, whether that be fighting a roc for a jewel from its nest, charming a god so that he will fetch a golden apple from his daughters' orchard, or performing a task for a weary queen so that she will grant you access to her magic mirror. If the challenge is successfully overcome by the PCs, then they may check that challenge off as completed. When all the challenges are completed, then the item can be crafted. If you like, the last challenge can be the crafting of the item itself, or after the completion of the last challenge, the item can be created through narration.<br/><br/>If you are recovering the item, draw cards based on the item's Recovery value. The values and challenge types are the same. Each scene will involve the PCs confronting a challenge on the road to the item's recovery, whether that be through scouring ancient maps, answering riddles, seducing guards, breaking curses, or fighting dragons. The scenes will be framed by one player, and then challenges added by the GM or another player, as with crafting. The major difference from crafting is that the final challenge of a recovery quest should always involve the actual recovery: an item should never be recovered \u201coff-screen\u201d.<br/><br/>_________________________<br/>Questions:<br/><br/>What should  the Crafting and Recovery values be for, other than to make for longer quests?<br/>What other categories might be appropriate for building crafting and recovery values?<br/>I was thinking maybe that if the PCs failed a given challenge (by whatever standard of failure) then they would still get what they needed, but it would add an appropriate complication to the quest. So if you failed a social quest, maybe the bearer of the item would be declared an enemy of some nation, that sort of thing. Does this sound like a good idea?<br/><br/>Any other comments and questions are, of course, welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264687/#Comment_264687" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-31T12:06:42+00:00" title="March 31, 2010 12:06PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to roll this over at Praxis, as it's very much design/testing-related.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264691/#Comment_264691" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-31T12:27:15+00:00" title="March 31, 2010 12:27PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!
