Coltan mining in Zaire (DRC) and the violence attached to it. Private military contractors. The war in Chechnya. The illegal shadow economy. Our eternal nemesis disease.<br/><br/><b>I want games that address these uniquely human (but sadly neglected) circumstances:</b> Drunken practical jokes. Also, ditto on isolation and high-density living. And ditto on player psychology, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_People_Play_(book)" rel="nofollow">Games People Play</a> the RPG.<br/><br/><b>I want games that evokes these little-used emotional responses:</b> Consciously self-destructive behavior. Spite driven by self-loathing. When you say what you're thinking before you realize it. Being inspired to create art.<br/><br/><b>I want games that help solve these problems at my tables:</b> Taking too much time to create a plan which goes out the window as soon as it's implemented. Feeling like I don't have enough narrative authority. Players not discussing play procedures (as opposed to mechanics), most of which are behaviors learned from other people, through play, and not from any game text. People I game with using mechanics and procedures I don't like (I guess that's really only my problem...).<br/><br/>Also, hi Craig!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cirv</cite>I want a game built around this under-utilized genre: Some RPG equivalent to the road movie without any supernatural weirdness or psychotic truckers neccessarily.</blockquote>\nI've played this game!

(BWAHAHA)<br/>It's interesting that it shows up in the "common social circumstance" <b>and</b> the "problem at my table" answers. When I did a Search in the topics for "food" a few old discussions came up, mainly focusing on player food/eating. I didn't see any that discussed in-game food/eating. Perhaps the game that someone develops that solves the "common social circumstance" answers will also have an optional mechanic that touches on integrating the real-life table eating with the game yet-to-be-played. Maybe it comes with recipes for the meals that appear in-game that can be prepared for the players beforehand?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167113/#Comment_167113" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T17:09:08+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  5:09PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 5:09PM by Marshall Burns.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas,<br/><br/>I might have your slapstick game.

I don't think this is gamable, because players like control of their characters, and forcing them to repeatedly do nonsensical and boring things is not a good game.<br/><br/>You can do this in any game you like.  All you need to do is say to a player "Your character will have a panic attack whenever confronted by X, or every forty minutes, whichever comes faster.  Your character may avoid this by doing Y.  Your character knows that there is no logical connection between Y and X.  This does not matter." <br/><br/>At that point the player will say "Dude, there is no fun in this!" and you'd stop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167377/#Comment_167377" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-06T01:35:53+00:00" title="September  6, 2008  1:35AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite><br/>A game dealing not just with mental illness, but with what it's like to have it, what it's like to know people who have it, what it is to deal with the fact that you have a mental illness during your more lucid times, to look back at what you did and being barely able to grasp why you behaved the way you did but knowing that it made sense at the time, and the knowledge that it'll happen again, that the crazy never goes away forever.<br/><br/>Note, I'm not talking about a game that emulates what it is to have a mental illness, so much as a game that captures the feelings surrounding it.</cite></blockquote>\nOCD's a bad choice, because people with it are -always- lucid.

Now, obviously it must be funny, or they wouldn't...but I don't get it and I've never really understood why.  I mean, I can see it takes the form of a joke, and that it's used in the expectation that the audience will recognise that its a joke, and people with OCD make jokes to each other about OCD rituals, but I have some sort of blind spot that I'm not getting the twist.<br/><br/>And this means that when people do this joke around me, I always sort of feel like "Um, there's that thing that's got the shape of a joke, but doesn't seem, actually, to be a joke, but that other people clealry feel is a joke." and that's just a weird sensation, like, oh...I don't know, my recent discovery that I can't taste saffron in food at all, and so there's this thing that thousands of other people really like, and I just can't experience it.<br/><br/>So, it was a serious question...is it just a schadenfreude thing?

I hate to say it, but more likely the answer to those problems is the ol' "find a different group".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167476/#Comment_167476" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T01:55:39+00:00" title="September  7, 2008  1:55AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Timothy</cite><br/>Hey, sorry about this, I probably should have spoken up earlier about the comment Sage made, but that day I wasn't up for fighting a socially accepted form of prejudice.<br/></blockquote>\nHey, no, it's cool, I am honestly asking Sage is this is a schadenfreude thing or what, because people make this sort of joke a lot, and I've never actually been able to see where the funny is.  Now, obviously it must be funny, or they wouldn't...but I don't get it and I've never really understood why.  I mean, I can see it takes the form of a joke, and that it's used in the expectation that the audience will recognise that its a joke, and people with OCD make jokes to each other about OCD rituals, but I have some sort of blind spot that I'm not getting the twist.<br/><br/>And this means that when people do this joke around me, I always sort of feel like "Um, there's that thing that's got the shape of a joke, but doesn't seem, actually, to be a joke, but that other people clealry feel is a joke." and that's just a weird sensation, like, oh...I don't know, my recent discovery that I can't taste saffron in food at all, and so there's this thing that thousands of other people really like, and I just can't experience it.<br/><br/>So, it was a serious question...is it just a schadenfreude thing?<br/><br/>Any further discussion should definitely be moved elsewhere, but since I obviously offended some people, let me just say that it was not intentional. I am mildly OCD (was much, much worse when I was younger). My comment was meant only in jest, and looking back on it, I should have taken into consideration that for many people OCD is much more serious then it was (and to a small degree still is) for me. <br/><br/>This takes care of schadenfreude (I would be laughing at my own suffering as well), but it was also not meant to be laughing at anybody. I was trying to laugh at OCD itself, at the stupid things it made (and still sometimes makes) me do. It was not laughing at another's misfortune, because it was not another's misfortune, and it was not laughing at the misfortune itself.<br/><br/>You ask questions that are far too large for me to answer, I can't tell you why other people would make similar jokes. On my part, I made the joke because in my experience, I knew my OCD behaviours were ridiculous (this doesn't stop them from being compelling), and therefore mocking them (for me) made it easier to accept them. I found that when I candidly told my friends in a slightly humorous way that I knew what I was doing was stupid, it made it easier to accept. When you find yourself having to excuse yourself at fairly regular intervals because you <i>know</i> that your hands are dirty and you need to wash them, but you also know that there's no reason to be washing your hands, joking about it makes it easier to deal with, in my experience. I am sorry that I let this approach form into a joke which could be considered insulting.<br/><br/>I was also trying to point out, as others have pointed out more clearly, that a direct translation of OCD into gameplay would not be enjoyable, or a very good way of conveying the feeling of OCD, or any understanding of it. When I first read your post, I did immediately think of game mechanics like rolling all your dice until they come up with the highest number (I routinely make sure that all of my dice sitting on the table between rolls have the highest face up, and I have no reason for this).<br/><br/>My sincerest apologies. If it will help in any way, I will delete the content of the post myself. I really can't apologize enough, as I really did like your idea. If you still feel a need to address this, please whisper me, and we can continue this in private.<br/><br/>Sorry to keep this in the same thread, but I feel like I need to defend myself just a bit. In retrospect, I can see how my comments could be misconstrued, but as a newer member of this community I'd really hate for this to color people's opinions of me. <br/><br/>Of course, this also being up another topic I'd like to see in a game: how to navigate a new social group (online, in person, whatever), without making a complete ass of yourself. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167635/#Comment_167635" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T23:43:30+00:00" title="September  7, 2008 11:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>I want a game set in this under-appreciated time:</b> 1989-1992, a time of upheaval and disillusionment in international relations and the resulting American political identity crisis.<br/><br/><b>I want a game built around this under-utilized genre:</b> Salinger-esque "Thinkin' about life and stuff, <i>HARDCORE</i>" kinda stories.
