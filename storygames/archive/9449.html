So, I'll answer the question instead...]<br/><br/>One of the best things another player did during a modern horror LARP was drop to the floor and shout "GRENADE!!!" for no apparent reason. He was playing a Vietnam veteran with mild amnesia and Alzheimer's. He'd flash back to the war, but most other players didn't realise this. They were all embroiled in dark plots of subtle horror, but this really upped the ante for them. Many of them seriously thought the game had been taken to a new violent level.<br/><br/>Which made it perfectly feasible for my conniving manipulator to sell them all sort of protection methods, both physical and mystical, real and fake.<br/><br/>A single word and I made a fortune in that game.<br/><br/>Once people got to the bottom of it later, my character was long gone.<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">V</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209347/#Comment_209347" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T02:33:57+00:00" title="May 28, 2009  2:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heheh, that's cool <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> So he did something that changed the players' perception of the fiction, providing an opening for you, something to spin off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209349/#Comment_209349" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T04:31:47+00:00" title="May 28, 2009  4:31AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll willfully ignore your player/GM dichotomy!

So, using his athletic ability and the hydraulic jacks built into his legs, we devised a plan where I was launched from a speeding truck to the roof of the building we were assaulting, with a line of rope.

It's magical when someone takes my input and makes something awesome that I could not make on my own.  Like when Tony Dowler took the cell phone conversations I'd narrated into our Geiger Counter game and tied them back to the game mechanics of the Paranoia condition.  That was wonderful.<br/><br/>Here's some other player awesomebuilding techniques I've experienced...<br/><br/>Throwing me fun curves:<br/><br/>In Montsegur last year, Wilhelm (playing Pierre Roger) assigned me to be God in one of his scenes.  I'm thrilled that he thought I was up to it.  (tho to be honest I'm not quite satisfied with what I came up with then.  I hadn't been listening hard enough to really understand the personal story of Wil's version of Roger and to really hit it hard with something tailor-made.)<br/><br/>Kibbutzing:<br/><br/>When we played our Heart of Darkness game last year -- it was Brandon (I believe) who suggested the last-minute surprise twist ending that was obvious and surprising and totally took the game over the top for me.  Brandon wasn't the GM, he was just another player with a small involvement in my guy's subplot, but he'd clearly been paying attention and when the right moment came he jumped in with the perfect idea.  <br/><br/>Holding me accountable:<br/><br/>Same game: with playtime dwindling, I wanted to spend some metagame resource to impose an arbitrary accident to guide the story in the way I wanted it to go, but Ben Robbins would not let me get away with that.  My character had to own that story point.  And after my guy pistol-whipped the fuel line and forced the boat to go in for gas, everyone at the table wanted my blood, and they were all in a killing mood.  Slithering through that gauntlet of accusation and successfully shifting blame onto the creepy dead LT -- that was intense and crazy fun for me and would not have happened had Ben let things slide.<br/><br/>Trusting me:<br/><br/>The D&amp;D game that I DM is pretty traditional and the players appear to trust that I'll bring entertaining stuff to the table.  (or at least they keep showing up and being positive about the game.)  This frees me to experiment with things.  Some of those experiments were, in retrospect, totally dumb and did not contribute fun, but they were still educational.  Some of those experiments worked out pretty well.  It's awesome to not feel like I have to play it safe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209881/#Comment_209881" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T13:22:40+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  1:22PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Listen harder, dumbass," was the note to self I made after listening to some AP recordings of my own GMing. The next step after listening harder is simply to respond to what you hear. For example, in a game I ran this weekend, a player had his character writing political tracts in an attempt to influence an election campaign. "I suppose," the player said at one point, "that'll cause a lot of tension with my wife." So I had a marital spat scene, which I think the player found very satisfying but which if I hadn't been listening I might not have initiated. So: listen, then respond--give people what they're asking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209970/#Comment_209970" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T05:20:20+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  5:20AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reflecting back on my anecdote, and the comments that other people have made...What makes a good player?<br/><br/>In my opinion, a good player is one who runs with the events presented to them and builds on these events rather than challenging them.<br/><br/>By keeping the flow of the game happening, you don't break the thread of immersion (for those players who like this sort of thing), and you have far less chance of having the game degenerate into arguments over what can or can't happen. In this type of atmosphere, people think about the narrative possibilities rather than the mechanical restrictions.<br/><br/>Openness tends to be far more beneficial to a group than closed-mindedness. Whether being open to the GMs descriptions and ideas, or being open to playing off the concepts introduced by other players. Being closed just slows things down or brings things to a stop (this is just as true for games as it is for any kind of group endeavour).<br/><br/>There are many aspects that make a good player, but openness is a big one for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210061/#Comment_210061" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T13:46:06+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  1:46PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>"Listen harder, dumbass,"</blockquote>\nI like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210063/#Comment_210063" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T14:04:22+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  2:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2009 2:10PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One interesting I've seen happen again and again is this:<br/><br/>* One player slips up, forgets, gets confused, or misspeaks, and says something that just doesn't make sense in the least.<br/><br/>* Immediately, another player sees his confusion and jumps in explaining why the things he just said DOES make sense. Suddenly, instead of the game needing a retcon and/or an argument about who's right, the game is driven to new heights by an unexpected twist!<br/><br/>Here's a really basic example for illustration. At its best, I've seen much more interesting/advanced applications of this kind of thing:\n<blockquote><br/>Bob: "...and as the door opens, you see none other but... Captain Jenkins!"<br/><br/>A moment of awkward silence--after all, everyone else remembers that Captain Jenkins died in the previous session. The one Bob had missed.<br/><br/>Lucy jumps in. "Oh my God! Captain Jenkins, alive! I knew it! The severed head we found was a fake, wasn't it, planted by you to cover up for your theft of the Empire Ruby? I've suspected you all along, since I noticed that the head was sitting on top of the fallen rocks instead of being buried underneath! After all, the collapse occurred two hours after your supposed 'death', didn't it?"<br/></blockquote>\nInstead of awkwardness, everyone has something new to work with, Bob is up to speed without having his contribution invalidated, and the story has developed a new twist. Especially interesting is how "Lucy" here has provided the GM (if there is one) an explanation without leaving it all up to him or her to cover up a seeming inconsistency.<br/><br/>I don't know what to call this, but it's a kind of rescue: not only "rescuing" the fiction and the pace of the game, but rescuing the misspeaking player's ego, as well.<br/><br/>Sometimes it happens when no one is "wrong" per se, but rather we realize that two people were imagining the same thing in incompatible ways. If another player can jump in with a simple explanation for WHY they disagree or why their perceptions differ, the game is instantly back on track, and usually made better for it.<br/><br/>[edited for grammar]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210125/#Comment_210125" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T06:15:38+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  6:15AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I don't know what to call this, but it's a kind of rescue: not only "rescuing" the fiction and the pace of the game, but rescuing the misspeaking player's ego, as well.</blockquote>\nThe discourse analytic term for such a face-saving move is a "repair."
