We emphasis minimal GM preparation (combat requires no preparation, though you might still tweak things before-hand if you like). We're also big time LARPers (Alliance), so we wanted a game that doesn't "get in the way" of role-play or story telling. <br/><br/>"When I heard this game was played with cards, I rolled my eyes. But by the time we finished playing, I was thinking up my own campaign to run." - John M<br/>_____________________________________________________________________<br/>The first thing that will jump out at people who first see the game is that you play with <i>cards</i>.  The cards you choose for your deck make you a unique character. The main choices have to do with different skills and how they fight.  Players also have a 1 page character sheet.  <br/><br/><a href="http://i.imgur.com/KB8CjDL.jpg" rel="nofollow">This is a card</a> that can go into anyone's deck, but it's less powerful than a card focused on a specific skill, like Stealth. The top left symbol is how many actions the card takes during the "Tactical phase" (when time matters, like combat, or if the atmosphere has been vented from a room).  The gear symbol clues you into knowing the card is for skills. 'Anytime' is when you can play it.  The bottom center "orange" block is only used for making your own deck. Players can choose 1 card from different categories, each of the categories is a color from the rainbow.  We recommend you start with one of our 8 pre-made decks until you've got a grasp on it. You can change your deck between any session.  <br/><br/>The GM also has their own deck. GMs don't have to spend an action to play a card. Instead, each card is worth an action and they draw 1 card after each player's turn.   These GM cards have a specific description as well as a general category. The GM can either use the card's description, their own description based off the category, or can discard the card to give a NPC an action from that NPC's stats, ie. if it was a NPC human, they could discard a card to roll that NPC's Charm or Brawl.  <br/><br/>So why cards?  We came up with cards when we realized we wanted players to have a lot of choices on how to do things - but make sure that certain choices wouldn't always be the best choice.  If you're a fighter in D&amp;D, you always use cleave.  In Spirit of the Century, you try and always use your 5-dice skill. In ADS, since your cards are constantly changing, and the GM's cards are constantly changing, you constantly try different things, which leads to some interesting developments. <br/><br/>"What's the difference between 2 successes and 5 successes?" - One of my first questions playing a game with Dice Pools<br/>_____________________________________________________________________<br/>My first project had a problem that I never solved. It had a skill system like D&amp;D, but I wanted any points spent in a skill to matter, but eventually the person who spent 0 points and 1 point had the same chance of success... 0%.   ADS uses dice pools with 1 success always resulting in a neutral or positive outcome.  That means anyone can attempt anything, and even 1 more die increases your odds.  But ADS also has strong recommendations for each extra success.  If the game doesn't say and/or the GM cannot think of a reason for extra successes, the player can bank those successes into a "Hero Points" type pool to be later spent to enhance another action.  <br/><br/>Skill dice work the same as combat dice.  Difficulty to hit a monster (their defense) or difficulty to succeed a skill are the same.  That means that many abilities (cards) can be used on both your skills and your combat dice. Some cards specify they can only be used for one or the other, but are more powerful because they are more specific. <br/><br/>Threat and building Suspense<br/>_____________________________________________________________________<br/>I've gotten into board games a lot, as well.  One thing I like about games like Pandemic is a building "Threat" mechanic.  Its an idea we've taken to ADS.  <br/><br/>First of all, there are several threat meter mechanics (each specific to a setting, but GMs are encouraged to homebrew).  The first setting/meter is Luminosity.  In Luminosity, the monsters are predators of the night, able to hunt more efficiently and see better in the dark.  The meter is Luminosity, a 0-10 meter ranging from Pitch Black (0), to indoor lighting (5), to summer at noon (10).  Players can increase the Luminosity by fixing/turning on lights, powering up equipment they've brought, or even blowing a hole in the ceiling (if it's daytime).  Monsters have their own nasty tricks, like breaking lights.  Monsters of the Sanguine type have higher defense and can move more quickly while in darkness.<br/><br/>Secondly, in the GM deck, there are a number of "Greater Creature" cards.  When these cards are drawn, they are placed in front of the GM.  Once 3 of them come out, a Greater Creature arrives, which is kind of a miniboss.  This could be a horrific nightmare, or it could be the bad guy's bodyguard hustling the players out of a talking scene. <br/><br/>Roleplay<br/>_____________________________________________________________________<br/>Cooperative narration isn't the focus of ADS.  However, games like Dungeon (Apocalypse) World have shown how you can give players more agency in a traditional RPG.  One of the most important things we've done is simplified the mechanics in the Roleplay.  There are only 2 skills, neither of which can be used on players.<br/>Guile:  You are trying to "screw" a NPC, who will probably dislike you in the future. <br/>Charm: You are trying to build a repertoire with a NPC, and maybe get some favors/special treatment from them. They will be receptive to you in the future. <br/>Skills are only rolled if you are trying to get a NPC to do something against their nature, or you have totally failed as a player to role-play a scene the way you intended.  <br/>All character personality choices have no effect on your character's stats. I've always felt you shouldn't choose to be from a region, to have a personality trait, or have a certain profession so you can get that "+2 to X."   <br/>To encourage roleplay, GMs can reward those "Hero Points" mentioned earlier whenever they feel a player is doing a great job of role-play, such as evoking their personality, profession, referencing their past, bringing another character into a conversation, etc.   Normally these Hero Points are capped, but GM awarded ones are spent last and ignore the cap.  <br/><br/>The Setting<br/>_____________________________________________________________________<br/>The first installment is called Luminosity.  It takes place a few hundred years in the future and is about the first intelligent race of creatures humanity encounters.  This race, called the Sanguine, are infected by a hostile organism. It turns out this infection had made its way to Earth before and when it did, we called it Vampirism.  While some of the myths are true, the most important thing to know is that Sanguine are sensitive to light.  Different sanguine will attempt to blend into humanity to prey on them, while others will conquer them and turn people into cattle.  Sanguine can infect unintelligent creatures to bend them to their will and psychically control them. Since they are also infected, they are also weakened by light.<br/><br/>Ok, well it looks like I ran out of room. I'm very open to hearing your opinion on anything and everything.  Just try to tell me something more specific than "It sucks, you're dumb, go die in a fire." ;-)                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445230/#Comment_445230" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-15T01:22:30+00:00" title="May 15, 2015  1:22AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds interesting (although the writing could use some editing).<br/><br/>But what kind of game is this?
