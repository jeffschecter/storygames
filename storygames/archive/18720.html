(This is also the best motivation to illustrate: sucker in liminally literate people who otherwise might ignore your product.) To actually play, you'll need to reconstruct your own internal model of the game anyway, and get inspired yourself, so the art doesn't actually do anything for you that can't be done more effectively by separate resources. (That is: if you need to get inspired, check out the bibliography of the game and read something appropriate, or whatever.) It's even more redundant than illustrations in a novel, as at least in a novel the illustrations operate on the same aesthetic and practical level with the text (they imbue an artistic impression upon the reader, which is what the text is doing as well), while in a roleplaying game the art is just something you look at in the midst of reading an operational guide to doing something else later. Illustrating a rpg is like putting pictures of famous mathematicians in a math text book: study hard, and you too can sport a cool beard like one of these guys!<br/><br/>RPG publishers of course get wrapped up in art and book design, as that's their hobby, just like playing games is the hobby of roleplaying gamers. They are happy when the book itself becomes an object of art, reflecting the nature of the game that comes to existence by following the instructions in the book. I allow them this pleasure, even if I don't find it important for the craft.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shiro" title="Shiro"><img alt="Shiro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shiro">Shiro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420097/#Comment_420097" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T04:48:38+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  4:48AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I work in graphic arts and have done a little illustration and comic work, so I find illustrations to be very useful in conveying the "look and feel" of a game. Humans don't just communicate with words. Good layout, design, and diagrams can help people understand or internalise game mechanics and concepts, especially if they process information visually. I also find second-rate art to be a bit of a turn-off; I find that when I read games, they create a structure and a "flavour" in my mind. Bad art can make the games taste less appealing.<br/><br/>I'm working on a new game at the moment, and I'm just starting to work on the layout and think about the overall look and feel.

It's all relevant enough, and I enjoy it for what it is, not what it isn't.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave" title="SteveDave"><img alt="SteveDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/267/nLSFO0MJD2Z0T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave">SteveDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420105/#Comment_420105" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T08:59:24+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  8:59AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of people are using "good art" in their opinions, which is certainly valid, but it is not really descriptive. Art by its nature is subjective. Personally, I am turned off when art gets too ideal. You see this a lot in female characters in fantasy art (who are stronger than average, but have proportions that lead one to believe that the figure drawn will snap in half because of how heavy the upper portions are and how thin the abdomen gets). It is in my opinion, unrealistic for the character that is trying to be portrayed, and therefore bad art. The majority of people out there disagree with me, though.<br/>The Simpsons' or South Park's art styles, as an example, are also examples of what I consider bad art because they don't even look human at times, but it is a very defined and established art style that is absolutely professional quality.<br/><br/>In short, my question then becomes, what is bad art?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420106/#Comment_420106" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T09:24:22+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  9:24AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I used to really, really care about the art that games have. I don't know when exactly it happened, but at some point I acctually stopped caring if art was <i>good,</i> and really just started caring if it was <i>present</i> and <i>relevant</i>. Present is optional for me, but if present, relevant isn't.</blockquote>\nThat's a good way of looking at it.<br/><br/>I think I look at art in game books mostly as a layout element.  The last RPG I read, Double Cross, is something like 4-500 pages long, of which maybe only fifty have any art on them at all.  As a result, the thing is just phenomenally dense and frankly a little off-putting to dig into at length (one reason why I had to take a break from <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18595/japanese-tabletop-rpg-rodeo-clearinghouse" rel="nofollow">writing it up</a>, a break which has lasted about a month, oops).<br/><br/>Art is also very practically useful for visually clarifying the intended tone or style of the game, especially if the text is wishy-washy about it (of course, the obvious rebuttal is "tighten up your prose instead of using art to communicate in lieu of words").  Love it or hate it, the copious and gonzo art in Tenra Bansho is a super-effective summary of the four-hundred-odd page rulebook in terms of telling people what kind of characters they play in that game.  The slice-of-life vignettes in Golden Sky Stories are also pretty good.<br/><br/>Of course, ill-chosen art can worsen already unclear texts; one example that's stuck with me for years is Hunter: the Reckoning.  Some portions of the book emphasize that PCs aren't supposed to be Buffy or Rambo, but working stiffs and homemakers flung into a strange and terrifying shadow war... so of course, all the art is of super-ripped dudes with assault rifles and slinky femme fatales licking blood off sharpened stakes!  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420109/#Comment_420109" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T09:58:34+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  9:58AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is my argument.  Take with a grain of salt, as I'm an artist who works in this industry.  <br/><br/>At best, art in RPGs uplifts the product.  At its best, it gives a sense of place and time and hints at cool plots and adventures.  It can spark ideas in both players and Gms alike.  It can sell product.  Do not discount the impulse buy.  It can help marketing.   It can convey certain types of information in seconds.  Example, in this fantasy world, elves are 8 feet tall.  Picture of elf standing next to human and dwarf gets this across in a mere second instead of reading it buried in a paragraph about the anatomy of elves.  <br/><br/>But that is "good" art.  The kind of art I aspire to.<br/><br/>At worst, at the <b>very worse</b>... art teaches you how to play the game.  I'm so glad that the OP used "<b>Manual</b>" in his opening title.  Because that are exactly what RPG books are.  Manuals.  And we humans learn better, faster with pictures in our manuals.  Even better, even quicker, when the pictures are in color.  Madison Avenue has known this theory since 1920s...this is not news to folks who make a living with visuals.  <br/><br/>Example.  Illo of Orc overloaded with gear on page 149.  He has 15 weapons, two knapsacks, a collapsible tent, two bedrolls and worg with a wrapped up broken leg hoisted up on one shoulder.  Now, this picture is next to the section on encumbrance.  Guess what you look for when looking up encumbrance rules?  Yup, that pic.  Even if the art isn't particularly well done, it serves the purpose of breaking up huge walls of text....which allows our brains to chew and digest that information better.  Remember, RPGS are not novels or biographies (although, sections might be).  There are not narratives to anchor the information.  They are text books and manuals.  There is boatloads of information to digest.  Breaking up that information is really, really useful.<br/><br/>So. Is art absolutely necessary?  No.  Does art make YOUR RPG more accessible?  You betchya!<br/><br/>'nuff said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420113/#Comment_420113" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T10:08:39+00:00" title="August 15, 2013 10:08AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2013 10:11AM by biffboff.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One useful purpose of art is simply being a permanent bookmark.

First addition Talislanta had two primary styles: the inked art and the pencil sketches; both highly detailed and presenting a clear vision of Talislanta. One last example: Jorune.

And that's a far less subjective thing to determine, in extreme cases. But tone often isn't conveyed in text (err, well, RULES text) at all, especially (as above) in toolkit or simple games.<br/><br/>And on the flip side, textual tone can detract from games as well. I'm kind of thinking of <i>In A Wicked Age</i>, here: It was HARD to ferret out procedures and pacing and scope from his highly conversational writing style and the book's minimal organization. Vincent likes "the conversation," but sometimes an enumerated list of steps goes a LONG way to conveying 'the right way to play'.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420125/#Comment_420125" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T13:00:22+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  1:00PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If all you've got is amateurish art for your book, don't use it. Amateurish art even makes settings and systems feel amateurish, no matter how much the author worked on those.<br/><br/>Art in general may improve reader's experience but only with readers who like the graphic style used or have no preconceptions of how the game's genre should look like. On top of that, the art has to actually convey emotions, behaviors and a lot of the setting and character's color, otherwise, you're wasting space on your book and money on an artist that can't actually help you sell your book.<br/><br/>Take this for example, though I dunno how many of you remember this: on D&amp;D's Monster Manual for 3.5, the image of the Red Dragon entry in the book had (as all dragon entries) a human or other figure on the side for size comparision. I remember the one of the Red Dragon in particular because the figure was comically running away from it. Not even the Tarrasque had that, and it certainly added a lot to the monster's concept. Well, art is like that, perhaps you missed it, perhaps nobody else liked it, but for me that piece was special.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420127/#Comment_420127" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T13:41:38+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  1:41PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Ask yourself honestly: Do the "Big Boys" use art because they can afford it, or was the investment in art over decades what made them "Big Boys"?<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hypothesis:</span><br/>I think games that actually work without art do so either because they're toolkits and the players provide setting (e.g., Fiasco, Universalis) or they're extremely simple games set in well-understood (or already wildly popular) settings.</blockquote>\nI'm inclined to agree.  Not everyone has creativity or imagination in equal measure; art can be extremely useful for conveying an impression of setting, and I'm inclined to believe that it's a big part of appealing to a wider audience.<br/><br/>For some games, the art is indelibly linked to the world in my mind - Jorune (which was already mentioned) and Polaris spring to mind in particular.  In Jorune's case, the art completely overshadowed the text, and that was a good thing!<br/><br/>I suspect art is important, too, for games with an element of gear fetishism (guns, mecha, or cute furry animals).  Like, I'm trying to imagine the Robotech RPG without art.  D&amp;D's endless monster manuals are a form of this - a dose of concept art adds variety to the conveyor belt of extra-planar aberrations.<br/><br/>Games about relationships need less art, I suspect.<br/><br/>I'll jump on the bandwagon - the fastest way to have art overshadow a product is for it to be amateurish.  Better an expert scribble than a polished turd.<br/><br/>Art is the first impression.

It's evocative. It's emotionally resonant. It's visual and communicates things elegantly that aren't well-communicated in prose. And it's very necessary in a strongly-designed game.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that there's a threshold that you need to meet, that you have to stuff enough art into your game. <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> does an <b>exemplary</b> job of using art. There's not a lot of it, but that's because the entire visual design is supposed to evoke an era that didn't see a lot of art in its printing. The scant few bits of art that you do see are immensely helpful for the setting, and incredibly colorful.<br/><br/>Art is design. Like any other part of visual design, use it properly.<br/><br/>(See also the immense appreciation one can have for Tenra Bansho Zero, 13th Age, and L5R 4th Edition, which I think are the three prettiest books I own, in terms of art.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420200/#Comment_420200" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-16T09:40:15+00:00" title="August 16, 2013  9:40AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2013 9:43AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>By their suggestion, there should never be a need for illustrations or pictures in any historical game ever.<br/><br/>That's just silly.</blockquote>\n"There should never be a need" is far stronger than what I said, which is that it's <i>a poor choice</i>.

Polaris, for example, has excellent style.  Dread comes reallyreally close, but doesn't quite get there (the internal art should've been weirder or more thematic/consistent).  LotFP products are almost always outstanding, and DCC RPG completely nails it.  So does Apoc World for that matter.  Games that are stylized visually very well convey the atmosphere the game is supposed to create in a way that that a bland reading of the mechanics.  Some of this comes from the words (compare Apoc World to Dungeon World and imagine how you'd play each) but much of it's from the visuals--I know inherently that DCC RPG is going to be this big, gritty thing, I know that LotFP stuff is going to be reaaaaaaly lethal to careless players, and if I had never heard the phrase grimdark before, I would completely understand it after even glancing at an interior illustration from a Games Workshop product.<br/><br/>I'm currently contracting for art for a game and it's easily the biggest cost--in fact there's a chance that the artist will make far more off the project than I ever do.  but great art combined with great design and great in-universe writing is the best thing a game or sourcebook can offer the players (and GM, if there is one).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420231/#Comment_420231" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-16T18:37:37+00:00" title="August 16, 2013  6:37PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But then to get that feeling in the game you'll have to rely on words anyway.

Even then, that will <b>still</b> produce a massive divergence from what the author was picturing.

If I want to convey a Blargus, or the Empire of Thorn, or Feyrie Magick, it's immensely helpful if I have a visual thing to give the reader, so that they can start building their own mental image of the thing.

Perhaps someone here may back me up with actual studies on psychology that demonstrate what I'm talking about here. <br/><br/>Well, I'm a comic artist; a long time ago I worked on a short comic in collaboration with a writer. At some point I asked him to roughly sketch or give me an idea to determine camera angle for certain panel, and he couldn't. It wasn't because a lack of artistic skills, but because this guy <i>could only think in words, and was at a loss when it came to visualize things.</i><br/><br/>I also write comics myself, but I realize I'd never be able to do full-written novels of good quality, mainly because most of my vocabulary for telling stories is <i>visual</i>. I know which face gestures should mix with which character posture to clearly give the idea of an specific attitude, but I'd have to consult a ton of words in dictionaries to know how to describe the same scene in a written description.<br/><br/>A few friends of mine who also work in comics can't even grasp writing a script, and end up drawing thumbnails straight from the images they have in their mind.<br/><br/>So the thing is, the same as they are different tastes in graphic styles and writing styles, in mixed media there will be different tastes in the amount of art needed for a game. What can we agree here I think, is that:<br/><br/>-Amateurish art will make your whole game feel amateurish.<br/>-Don't repeat in simple words whatever any art you have is already showing; add meaning and depth to the drawing, add all the color that isn't already there, tell me whatever the image isn't telling me.<br/>-If you can give me a drawing I can show my players to convey a feeling or express a concept more quickly, please do.<br/>-And yes, as a GM I'll not always be able to show a picture of whatever I'm describing, so if you can give me the verbal tools to comunicate that, you're welcome.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420256/#Comment_420256" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T10:55:33+00:00" title="August 17, 2013 10:55AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I'm just gonna ask: Folks, those of you who think art doesn't have much use or is even negative in RPGs, do any of you work at  all with drawing/painting/doodling/photographs/photo-manipulation/whatever ?<br/><br/>WarriorMonk is a cartoonist, I'm a doodler, I don't know what everyone else is who likes art. <br/><br/>I am starting to get the impression that the break-point of pro/con artwork is falling along lines that have to do with whether you work with some sort of visual art or not yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420257/#Comment_420257" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T11:14:18+00:00" title="August 17, 2013 11:14AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Okay, I'm just gonna ask: Folks, those of you who think art doesn't have much use or is even negative in RPGs, do any of you work at  all with drawing/painting/doodling/photographs/photo-manipulation/whatever ?</blockquote>\nI've got a degree in engineering and design, though I work more with engineering than design nowadays.

It's all visual and images and even camera angles (even when not playing PTA). Now, movies and TV shows do visuals very well, of course, but it translates badly into words. When you imagine things in images and use words to describe them, you lose the advantages of the visual medium without gaining the advantages of the verbal. I wonder if all the visual art in game books exacerbate this problem. A good description should not just describe how something looks, but how it sounds, smells, tastes and feels. It should use metaphors and similes. It should describe the emotional qualities of the experience of the characters in the fiction. We already tend to think in images because we consume more movies and TV shows than we do books, and when the game communicates the setting to us in images, it only serves to further tilt the balance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420259/#Comment_420259" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T11:28:21+00:00" title="August 17, 2013 11:28AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Okay, I'm just gonna ask: Folks, those of you who think art doesn't have much use or is even negative in RPGs, do any of you work at  all with drawing/painting/doodling/photographs/photo-manipulation/whatever ?</blockquote>\nI've got a degree in engineering and design, though I work more with engineering than design nowadays.

Most of the game is about verbal negotiation, which requires ritual phrases. You can make infographies to explain game procedures and silent comics for explaining what's happening in the fiction, but to explain how players negotiate the fiction you'd need to give them the verbal tools. Even if you wanted to turn Techniques into gestures (which is actually possible providing all players learn them) you'd still need to explain what these gestures symbolize and when they should be used.<br/><br/>So yes, it's kinda possible, though it would actually take a shorter time to explain it with text, that's all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420265/#Comment_420265" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T14:32:24+00:00" title="August 17, 2013  2:32PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Okay, I'm just gonna ask: Folks, those of you who think art doesn't have much use or is even negative in RPGs, do any of you work at  all with drawing/painting/doodling/photographs/photo-manipulation/whatever ?</blockquote>\nI'm a graphic designer of sorts, mostly as part of a general publishing skill package.

On the surface, I'd say you could certainly do the <i>world building</i> part of creating an RPG in only images. Look at stuff like 300 and other such graphic novels. Even text-light or no-text graphic novels can convey a world and a story very effectively, with all the color and emotion that a visual medium can bring.<br/><br/>However, as soon as you go from free-form roleplaying to having <b>any</b> rules for the adjudication of outcomes, then you absolutely need text and more importantly math. You could perhaps do so in comic-book form, showing how a game is run rather than explaining the actual rules. That would be quite neat and original. But no, you wouldn't be able to get away with only images.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420269/#Comment_420269" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T15:10:45+00:00" title="August 17, 2013  3:10PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In books about writing there aren't pictures of people sitting at laptops in Starbucks.<br/><br/>In books about radio dramas there aren't pictures of people standing at microphones on <i>every page</i>.</blockquote>\nIn books about role-playing games, there usually aren't pictures of people sitting around tables with sheets of paper, pencils, and funny dice, either. Yes, I have in fact seen such pictures once or twice, but it's certainly the exception, not the rule. Your objection here is disingenuous.\n<blockquote>It's just ludicrous and insane that books about playing RPGs have tons of art in it and it's useless, a huge waste of money and space, and nobody should like it, ever.</blockquote>\nSo, you're not familiar with Talislanta, Skyrealms of Jorune, Warhammer 40K, D&amp;D: Dark Sun, The Shadow of Yesterday, or any of the many other games with a fantasy or science-fiction setting in which artwork is the fastest and easiest way to convey details about the setting and its tone?

You can't convince a verbal player to go visual, it's like convincing a cat-person to become a dog-person. And for people who have an easier time thinking on visuals, it's the same thing, we tend to perceive blocks of texts as blocks of text and not as fiction, but when we see an image we can imagine even the things that aren't there. <br/><br/>If you've happen to have one foot on each world, however, you'd be able to take advantage of both properly, as long as you don't repeat yourself by explaining in words exactly whatever is in the images. Just complete the image to make your fiction more vivid, and that's it.<br/><br/>So no, you can't convince me either that text-only games are cooler than games with meaningful inspirational art, but I respect your perspective since we're completely different and we both have our place in the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420275/#Comment_420275" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T16:28:59+00:00" title="August 17, 2013  4:28PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh heck, I just like aggressive conversation with JD. <br/><br/>He annoys and challenges me, and makes me laugh in equal amounts.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420276/#Comment_420276" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T16:29:56+00:00" title="August 17, 2013  4:29PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2013 4:30PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course not, comics and movies and other visual media are fine conveying things visually.

I never said those games <i>could not</i> get their setting across except through artwork; I said it was the fastest and easiest way to convey detail and (a sense of) tone.<br/><br/>What does a jabberwock look like? You could spend a paragraph describing its appearance, or you could include an illustration and save the text space for details that directly affect the game, such as its habits and how it fights. And then the illustration still allows the game master to describe the monster in their own words, or just show the illustration, whichever they prefer. <br/><br/>Again, your argument only makes sense to me if you're advocating that the rules of any given RPG should be entirely separate from the imaginative content of setting.

Look at all those stupid novelists still trying to muddle by, struggling with just words, when if they only knew what they could do with words AND art.  They had it right when manuscripts were illuminated! Everything has gone downhill, except comics, since then.  <br/><br/>Like I say, the industry standard in RPGs is at least 1 piece of art per page.  With heavily produced RPGs it is often 2-4.

Just let me throw my rocks against the 4,000 foot thick steel reinforced concrete wall that's been erected around this perfect and never-again-changing aspect of our god damn hobby in peace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420293/#Comment_420293" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T01:42:03+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  1:42AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2013 1:42AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, my own opinion is largely along the same lines with Jason. And as he says, there's no particular need to argue about the matter. To learn of different viewpoints, yes, but not to argue, simply because there's not that much of an argument to it; we just have different opinions about what kinds of books make each of us the most happy. For my part I know that a game's art or lack of the same has never caused me to gauge its utility to be substantially different, so when somebody puts major effort and sacrifice into the visual art of the work, it's a natural thing to look at that really critically: is it actually about their own enjoyment of the book-maker's art (something I like very much myself - just look at <i>Carcosa</i>!), or is it really about the game itself?<br/><br/>And of course art is not the same as book design - you still need high-class typography and page design and structural choices and diagrams (themselves having nothing to do with rpg illustrative art, which is the topic here) to make a good book, even if you are taking a swing at a low-art or art-less rpg book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420322/#Comment_420322" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T21:01:20+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  9:01PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2013 9:01PM by JasonT.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coming from a design background, I really appreciate a visually well-designed game. Sometimes a good design includes some illustrations, but it doesn't have to. It's more important to me that the typography, layout, and color communicate what kind of game something is than the pictures. <br/><br/>All of that said, it's more important to me that the words in the game communicate what kind of game something is than any aspect of the visual design. I've certainly played and enjoyed games that weren't particularly visually attractive. I just appreciate it a bit more \u2013\xa0and am a lot more likely to actually pick something up in the first place, without a recommendation from others \u2013 when a game looks nice. (Part of why I was so determined to run Ghost/Echo was that just <i>looking</i> at it made me go, "That looks so cool!" \u2013\xa0and then the intriguing minimalism in the rules themselves reinforced my first impression.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420324/#Comment_420324" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T21:17:08+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  9:17PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

Y'know, browsing a shelf, flipping through a book, deciding right then and there whether they're going to take it up to the counter and buy it. Are the art-lovers mostly impulse buyers, collectors, and/or regular shoppers?<br/><br/><br/>As for me, I'm none of those things. I'm the guy who waits until he's heard/read some opinions about a game, asks some questions about it, looks for more information online about it, then <i>still</i> won't buy it unless my friends are interested in playing it with me AND we plan on playing it within the next week or two. The art can't really sway my choice one way or the other.<br/><br/>(Which doesn't mean that game designers are crazy to put art in their books: if the people who love art are also the ones who buy the most books, hell, they pretty much HAVE to, right?

My take is, art and typography makes a game <i>look</i> better, which is important if you want people to buy it, but it doesn't do much to make it <i>play</i> better.</blockquote>\nWell, to be fair, layout and typography <i>can</i> actually affect your experience (or at least my experience) playing games. Good design makes information clearer; bad design (or at least problems in design) can make key information harder to absorb or even notice at all, which can lead to inconsistencies or mistakes in how rules are handled. <br/><br/>I'm sure I could come up with more egregious examples with a bit more thought, but just to give you an example offhand: I recently learned that I ran Castle Falkenstein wrong for <i>years</i> because of the way a certain bit of information was presented in the book. This completely changed the way the game was played. (In case you were curious: You play cards from your hand to boost your abilities when attempting something challenging; you're supposed to redraw after every card played. I missed this thanks to it only being mentioned once anywhere in the entire book, tucked into a paragraph at the top of a page following most of the rest of the card rules, and not called out visually in any way at all. More careful paragraph layout and/or intelligent use of contrast in typefaces sure would've helped ... but of course a "rules summary" page at the end of the book probably would've been even better. )<br/><br/>Edit to add: Oh, and it's worth noting that Castle Falkenstein has some gorgeous and inspirational artwork. It's great!

Sometimes, peoples words aren't good enough to communicate what they mean, and images can serve as a conceptual course-corrector.<br/><br/>The splat images in White Wolf games (particularly Mage), the playbook images in Apocalypse World, the grainy shoops of WWII soldiers in Godlike, morphs in Eclipse Phase: these all got my mind racing with possibilities. Seeing them made the words real for me in a way just imagining didn't. Bad art, just like bad flavor text, can yank me right out of the flow of absorbing a book, for sure.

Simply, by any form of communication, you contribute to this 'space' that is 'imagined' and 'shared'.<br/><br/>Saying that it's all verbage or all mental imagery is overly reducing the possibilities.  Metaphor, similie, implication, denotation, connotation, expectation...the actual substance of the SIS is defined by the study of semiotics.  (Research of that term is left as an exercise for the student.)<br/><br/>So saying that the words in the manual are the only important part because words are how you contribute to the SIS is true...up to a point.<br/><br/>Saying that artwork is necessary to conveying non-abstract concepts into the SIS is also true...up to as point.<br/><br/>Simon_Pettersson's point about using entirely cinematographic cant to add to the SIS is also true.  And it reveals a point often missed in 'how' discussions of gaming.  The social mechanics of a group supercedes anything that can be put into a game manual. (He demonstrates a group happy with their communication method, even as it alienates him; I think.)<br/><br/>And that's what this goes down to.  It's a subjective preference.  Some people enjoy picturesque games, others text-heavy.  Some like mechanics-heavy, others fast-and-loose.<br/><br/>(And yes, we all agree that bad parts mix into a bad game.)<br/><br/>SteveDave's OP is clearly about requesting various opinions, but we started talking like there was a 'right' answer.  When you bring semiotics and SIS into it, I can't believe how much we seem to agree.<br/><br/>Fang Langford                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421154/#Comment_421154" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-06T02:59:31+00:00" title="September  6, 2013  2:59AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Okay, I'm just gonna ask: Folks, those of you who think art doesn't have much use or is even negative in RPGs, do any of you work at  all with drawing/painting/doodling/photographs/photo-manipulation/whatever ?<br/><br/>WarriorMonk is a cartoonist, I'm a doodler, I don't know what everyone else is who likes art. <br/><br/>I am starting to get the impression that the break-point of pro/con artwork is falling along lines that have to do with whether you work with some sort of visual art or not yourself.</blockquote>\nI doodle, and I love good visuals.

You walk in, see a book, flip through it, check out the pictures. You're probably not standing there and reading it to figure out if it's Fate in the Middle.<br/><br/>That goes for Jason's fiction argument, too. You might very well buy the book because you like the cover. <br/><br/>Once you purchase it, then the art has a different purpose. It might help you imagine the setting or how to play it. It might break up the monotony of all-text layout. It might serve as signaling layout for chapter breaks. <br/><br/>Yeah, you can generally describe the same things in words as you could describe in a picture, but a picture is more or less instantaneous. It has a visceral effect on people. Bam, story. That's a powerful tool for marketing and sales, and a useful tool for conveying mood and setting for players and GMs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421283/#Comment_421283" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T15:33:54+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  3:33PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2013 3:34PM by creases.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>You open the door, and you see\u2014THIS!</i> *plonk down a piece of art*<br/><br/>Is that not a thing other people do?

Illustrates a fantastic place, creature, or situation (which you can use as I indicated above). (I don't think it's as rare as you've made it out, Eero. There are games I can name where this is the main use of full page art, like <i>Dungeoneer! Advanced Fighting Fantasy</i>. So it's not a different topic at all.)<br/><br/>2. Offers you a cool example of the sort of character you could make or adventure you could have, which you can use as inspiration. (Most 4e art seems to be like this. AD&amp;D 2e was hella about this.)<br/><br/>3. Illustrates a game concept (like flanking or surprise).<br/><br/>4. Space filler when a paragraph is too short, or in place of a typer's flower between subsections.<br/><br/>I dunno, I feel like all of those can have a place?

Specifically, I've used illustrations of pre-made NPCs as visual aids when introducing those characters in play, and I've used maps from books as well.<br/><br/>(I've also prepped my own stuff, like marking up Philadelphia on Google Maps to show where all the tethers to Hell are, but I figured it was worth chiming in to agree that the art in books can actually be functional beyond that initial burst of inspiration.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18720/art-in-game-manuals" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18720/art-in-game-manuals" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18720/art-in-game-manuals/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18720%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18720%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
