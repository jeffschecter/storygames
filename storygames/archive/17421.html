You are in charge of your character. We phrase the games as "What If" stories. Ours was\u2026<br/><br/><b>"What If Kirsta Was Editor &amp; Chief of Marvel Comics!"</b><br/><br/>Players chose characters. <br/><br/><b>Krista set her edicts:</b><br/>- Female Heroes Can Save Themselves;<br/>- Men &amp; Women Appear In Refrigerators Equally;<br/>- Everyone Has Practical Costumes;<br/><br/>We put the edicts on the Editor's Wall.<br/><br/>Civil War was our starting point.<br/><br/>BUT I enjoy it when Situations and Characters reflect each other. So we looked at the chosen characters, pulled out the events from Civil War that made sense, and composed a list. We then added new events for cosmic characters like the Silver Surfer, and epic characters like Thor and Ghost Rider. <br/><br/>These events were filtered through Krista. She approved them, wrote them on stickies (changing phrasing for clarity and excitement) and then we posted them to the Editor's Wall.<br/><br/>Krista then introduced the Editor's Wall to the players.<br/><br/><b>We made it clear that:</b><br/>- This is the player's sandbox;<br/>- Do anything and go anywhere within these elements;<br/>- But keep in mind what is fun for everyone;<br/>- Elements that are ignored escalate independently;<br/>- The sandbox will grow, shrink, and changed based on your actions;<br/>- Player characters don't have to stick together (we used Action Order to track spotlight).<br/><br/>GMs updated the Editor's Wall to reflect changes made by the character's actions and players could add stickies for anything we forgot. This allowed us to keep track of what interested players as well as giving the GMs a communication tool to work within the same persistent world. <br/><br/>We then reviewed the Editor's Wall at the start and end of each day to get everyone on the same page. <br/><br/>When the game started, we described the event that kicked off Civil War and asked each player to answer these questions out loud:<br/>1. What do you love about your character?<br/>2. What don't you love about how your character has been depicted?<br/>3. What does your character think when they hear about THE event?<br/><br/>We used the answers to guide play. <br/><br/>No prep was done beforehand and we played 18 great hours with 13 people!<br/><br/><b>What I would do differently:</b><br/>- Go through each event and ask players to raise their hands if it interests them and mark the number of raised hands on the sticky;<br/>- Keep track of emergent themes (family emerged as our theme);<br/>- Make it explicit that players can move the stickies around (they did this on their own to make plans but I would state this up front);<br/>- Ask players to add new stickies for anything that came up in a scene that they might want to show up again.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
