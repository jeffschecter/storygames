                    I like boards. Especially boards which are maps divided into squares. You roll a die and move that number of squares. Why aren't they used more in RPGs?<br/><br/>Take something like Dungeons and Dragons. A standard dungeon crawl would be great on a board. Roll dice to move the party forward. Fight the monster. Then the positioning on the board can be used in the fighting: your bow can fire an arrow four squares; to hit the monster, you need to be in an adjacent square.<br/><br/>But not just Dungeons and Dragons. You can imagine using this in more story-based games. Say, a Dogs In The Vineyard style game: youâ€™ve got a map of a town, and inside every house thereâ€™s a Dilemma Spot (or something), and when you land on it, you draw a card with a moral dilemma on it. Or there are villagers, which move randomly about the board, and, if thereâ€™s a mob scene, you can see exactly where they are.<br/><br/>OK, that exampleâ€™s a bit crap, because it adds another layer to Dogs that doesnâ€™t need to be there. But what Iâ€™m suggesting is a game that uses a map and, in some way, uses the positioning of NPCs and items to fuel the narration. Perhaps a game like Pinnacle Empty Quiver, which involves infiltrating an enemy base, might benefit from this.<br/><br/>But! Having said all that, would a board take away from the game? Would the players focus on the board rather the roleplay? I feel, intuitively, that thatâ€™s a riskâ€¦but thenâ€¦thatâ€™s not how it works with dice, is it? You donâ€™t get players focussing so much on the dice that they forget to roleplay.<br/><br/>Help me sort my thoughts out here. Is there a possibility of using boards, especially boards with maps, to enhance roleplaying games? If so, what about story-based games? Or would the board always draw focus and detract from the roleplaying?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            Hey Graham, there is a Dungeons and Dragons board game (available in The Europe, which is apparently near where you live), and it is brilliant.  It's exacly what you are describing and it is well designed and loads of fun.  <br/><br/>I like tactile, physical stuff as well.  One problem with introducing a map/board into an RPG is that it either represents physical space and thus sharply constrains play, or isn't, and may be unneccessary in its abstractness.  Obviously this will vary from project to project, and even a representational map can be made modular or whatever.  I think the real sweet spot for RPG design isn't the move-three-squares sort of map, but the one that represents character or global states.  That's what I'm doing in Grey Ranks - you've got a grid that the characters move around on, and it indicates state of mind, with debilitating, fatal extremes in the four corners.  It's a convenient and useful way to represent this visually, in a game where it is important that every player know where every character's head is.                        </div>

                            I picked up that D&amp;D boardgame at a remainder shop for about Â£10 I think.  Sometime last year.  It's neat and fun, very much like Hero/Warhammer Quest.  There's also Descent, World Of Warcraft and Runebound that I can think of off the top of my head, <br/><br/>There's the other aspect though, of people narrating the actions in a regular boardgame.  I mean, I've played Talisman with people who narrated their character's actions.  Actually, after a while it became a bit rote, like the "And so it came to pass..." aspect of Polaris.<br/><br/>But yeah, boards can be neat.  I use Lego Pirate ships for my 50 Fathom's game, and that rocks.                        </div>

                            I like the idea of boards to an extent. Miniatures even more. But that said...<br/>
<br/>
I find the European D&amp;D board game to be crap. It is in no way a RPG, for one. Second, the mechanics are staid stuff that's been around forever, and didn't work well the first time. Third, the mechanics are meant to play fast, but (unlike, say, chess) do not provide for any real tactical challenge. The optimal strategies are pretty transparent from the get-go to anyone who's played any such games before.<br/>
<br/>
The components are nice, and I wanted to like the game. Clinton was very excited when he got his copy. But, very simply put, I didn't enjoy it at all.<br/>
<br/>
These things all seem to be a step backwards to me. Oh, not because they're not RPGs. I understand the need for abstractions here that make the game play quickly. But gaining Hit Points from opening traps? The old Dungeon boardgame had more intuitive rules!  Original D&amp;D, the miniatures game from which RPGs come, wasn't a bad minis game. Not the greatest by any means. But not bad. If you want a "boardgame" like this, then you could do a lot worse than simply playing that.<br/>
<br/>
By which I mean to say that we should have come some way from that in thirty years. But apparently the people who are using the D&amp;D trademark here haven't.<br/>
<br/>
The essential problem with a "boardgame RPG" to me is that the act of character portrayal tends to get downplayed by the presence of the board. That is, a board indicates that there is an importance to the space surrounding the character, and his position in it. Which suggests - for no other reason than tradition alone - a tactical situation of some sort. Likely combat.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a real challenge, one I've been posing to myself for about a year now - is there another way to use portrayal of space around a character to promote some other facet of RPG play? Social interaction, for instance. Certain political intrigue games come to mind. Position as indicative of who you can communicate with, for instance. Or what you can know. Think about Clue (Cluedo to you folks over the pond). Think about Monopoly, and how your position represents purchasing opportunities, or financial challenges.<br/>
<br/>
A really good Iron Game Chef entry was about "waltzing" (moving like a knight does) around a chessboard representing a ball-room, such that those you come into contact with on your turn you can interact with. I thought that was brilliant.<br/>
<br/>
So what I'm thinking is all of the sorts of interactions that happen in RPGs without boards, and how to facilitate them all with a board. No, not just financial, or just social...but how to construct boards on the fly like constructing dungeons such that you can facilitate most any sort of adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Boards make us think like boardgames. It's only natural for us to think that if we're nailed down by such a "hard" representation of physical space, that we need to have similarly "hard" rules for, say, buying a sword. Which makes one think like a CRPG designer (or it does me). Meaning not allowing the sort of flexibility that one gets with a RPG. If I want a "hard" environment of this sort that lacks flexibility, though, I have plenty of CRPGs that will do that.<br/>
<br/>
How can we use boards to play RPGs? Instead of regressing them into boardgames again?<br/>

                            Mike!  I disagree with everything you said* about the D&amp;D board game, which is totally gonzo and great.  What's not to like about gaining back hit points for disarming traps?  The game's not trying to be realistic, it is trying to be fun.  It makes a number of similar concessions to playability, and they are all spot on.  And this is me scolding you for saying that it isn't a roleplaying game!  <br><br>*Except the optimal choice thing, which is true.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hmm. I think it depends largely on what you use the board to represent and how you interact with that. As Mike says, if you tie it closesly to physical space and position in it, you end up thinking in a particular tactical way.<br><br>Now if you changed it to interaction spaces, or emotional spaces, or story arc space, then I think you could do some interesting things. Like Jonathan's diagram for his Exalted Hack or a more hardwired relationship map.<br><br>Of course, in some ways character sheets are like boards. One of my current projects uses a character sheet that's a map of a city. You tie each of your stats to a particular neighbourhood and its fortunes are related to your own in play.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

That sounds really interesting! One of my many projects (Yesterday's Tomorrow)revolves around a map of a city too, which acts as the physical representation of the various themes and problems in the setting.

This is what I've found. Back when I played dnd3e we used to use a big battle map with squares and minis and the whole shaboodle. It might make it easier to visualise where everyone is, but it also reduces the visualisation to the board and the minis - when you've got minis in front of you to play with, there's not a whole lot of imagination and higher level visualisation going on. At least that's what I found, so I ditched the board and reverted to describing a scene instead.                        </div>

I think this is exactly right. <br><br>To go back to the example from my dnd game, having the board meant the game and the rules and the combats flowed nicely, but the roleplaying aspect suffered. And vice versa of course.                        </br></br></div>

<p>Ok, so everyone seems to be in agreement that boards &amp; maps can distract and they can facilitate different kinds of play.  So what kinds of play can they facilitate?</p>
<p>It's a no-brainer to say that boards can facilitate strategy.  But what else?  Back in my Mage days, when I was a clue-happy GM, we had this evolving map of a fictional city in the mountains of Colorado.  At least one of the players delighted in marking landmarks, such as the Dunkin' Doughnuts where strange things regularly occurred, and sharing it with the rest of the group.  At the same time I regularly used the map as a sort of anchor-clue.  Like when a baddie shows up and starts bottling hatred and rage at the local water bottling plant.  During that chapter players used the map of the city to see that the unexplicable bouts of bloody violence were centered in a particular part of town.  Could I have just told them, as the GM, that all these fights were just happening in a small neighborhood?  Sure.  Definately.  But there is totally another level of fun to figuring it out with visual aids.</p>
<p>Granted, if the players hadn't figured out to look into water sources in that neighborhood on their own, then I certainly would have eventually pointed their noses at the particular plant I wanted them to find.  But at that point there would have been much more violence that potentially could have been stopped earlier.  Which would have been awesome too.</p>
<p>All of which is just my long-winded way of saying that boards &amp; maps can support strategy and clue hunting.  But there's gotta be other things they can support, right?</p>

                            Think about Reiner Knizia's <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/823" rel="nofollow">Lord Of The Rings boardgame</a>.  That has a board which essentially represents how far along the plot of the book the players are.  The board is not a map of where the characters are physically, so much as dramatically.  Certain things on the board represent obstacles to be overcome.  There are rules about how far forward you can move and what you need to get past various events.  There's also this thing about how corrupt you can get, with a track represneting the temptation of the ring or something like that.<br><br>This has quite a bit of meat for more narrative focussed RPGs.                        </br></br></div>

<p>My point is that all these games can be done with or without a map or board.  I don't even think that a visual aid would necessarily facilitate any of these types of games.  But, at the same time, if any of these games were strategic in nature, I can imagine the benefit of map or board.  So I think it's the strategy factor that makes the visual aid useful.  Not that there's football in it.</p>

I'm into half-and-half.  I'm a much more visual/tactile learner than audial (reading), which is a sentiment that I absolutely agree with.  But going 100% visual would probably set back the audial dudes a bit (IMO, "FUCK 'EM! Bloody Audial Learning Bastardos!")<br/><br/>Anyway, not much of a contribution, but I've always held a fascination for the board game "Prince of Florence", with the idea that a board similar to this for each character would make an awesome character sheet:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://files.boardgamegeek.com/bggimages/pic436.jpg"/><br/><br/>Also, I'm so-so on the idea of making RPGs too much like boardgames... but Rich Stokes comment on the LOTR boardgame with the "thematic board"... that's some hot stuff right there.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Try this: Instead make a board out of paper or something like the Agon board, with zero humanity at one end and whatever the maximum is at the other**.  Put your little pirate minis on that board to show everyone what your current humanity is.  You've just added a board to Sorcerer, it's not a map and it might be useful.  At a glance you can tell who's holding out and who's about to flip out.<br/><br/>* It's been a while since I played the game, I can't remember what it's actually called, but you get the idea.<br/>** It's been a while since I read Sorcerer too.                        </div>

                            Drifting a bit here, sorry, but Princes of Florence prompted me.<br/><br/>I've been in a boardgame club since '98 that plays designer boardgames like Princes of Florence and I have a ridiculous collection of these cardboard artifacts.<br/><br/>These days, I'm feeling like boards and maps are usually a distraction from the kind of role-playing I'm interested in.<br/><br/>That said, I feel like there are huge design elements/lessons that a lot of these kind of boardgames could lend to a "story game" design that are *mostly* untapped in the texts that I'm familiar with.<br/><br/>Most of my half-baked design notes over the last two years have been playing with ideas that spring from this perceived gap.  More tactically satisfying resource management and spatial elements are the two areas I play around with the most.<br/><br/>Agon (board), Dust Devils (cards), DRYH (push-your-luck), and WotG (the "River" mechanic) are designs I see that could have been informed by some of the play elements I enjoy from boardgames, and I'd like to see more like this.                        </div>

                            Once I ran a game loosley based on the d20 version of Legend of the Five Rings.  The PCs sat at once end of a large gridded board and there were houses and shops on either side of the board.  There was an army of bad guys (Tsuro) that flooded the streets.  The PCs just kileld as many as they could and when they died they appeared, videogame style, in a nearby graveyard to come back onto the scene, losing only a bit of time and XP.<br/><br/>Sure, it doesn't sound brilliant, but as a change of pace to our normally angst filled, pathos ridden, character driven, plot-fests, this was a nice distraction.  And in practice it was fun.<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>

                            Face of Angels online?  Yay!<br/><br/>The problem with boards is trying to figure out what to put on the board and what to write on a sheet.  Like I thought about having characters in Polaris move around in the Cosmos as little minis (this was back when the Cosmos was a shared space that all characters occupied.)  But the problem is that it's just easier to write down names than to figure out what mini corresponds with what dude.<br/><br/>Likewise, I could totally do up Bliss Stage as a puerto-rico style board game, which each relationship as its own little cardboard piece, intimacy, trust, and stress chits, and so on and so forth.

                            Boards are used when there's spatial elements that are relevant to gameplay, but common, simultaneous accessiblity seems to be the key advantage - and that's mostly a matter of scale, font size and placement.  A player can glance over at another player's Prince of Florence "player mat" and make tactical decisions based on what they see.  The "board" in this case is simply a large scale character sheet with a geometric/puzzle factor.<br/><br/>Last time I ran FATE, I wrote the key Aspects and best Skill proficiencies for each of the PCs on a HUGE posterboard so that we could all view them during play.  The idea here was so each player could keep the flags and color that each character brought in front of them at all times.  I checked off skills used so I could see which players had got to add their flavor of awesome to the soup to that point.  But yeah...  really just a big sheet there.<br/><br/>Grey Ranks looks like it's using a board to good effect.<br/><br/>There's a lot of literature about what boards do linked from boardgamegeek and in various boardgame design blogs.  I can't fetch any today, but the links are there to be found.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>What are boards good for that sheets aren't?</blockquote>
Awesome Question.<br/><br/>First, a brief tangent on using boards:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.kidzworld.com/img/upload/article/a362i1_karateheadweb.jpg"/><br/><b>GM: "6 boards with your face? OK, you pass your humanity roll".</b><br/><br/>Now back to "What are boards good for".<br/><br/>1) I'm thinking for games that require a moderate or high amount of resource movement or allocation, or change, boards are better than pencil-erase-write-erase-write.<br/><br/>2) In other games, the board can be a fun aesthetic element.<br/><br/>In the example above, the Humanity Board for Sorcerer, that would be #2: Not required, but it's a cool element to set in the middle of the table just to keep it in everyone's mind. When the figures move around the board (once or twice per session), it's almost like watching the hand of fate in motion.<br/><br/>Examples of the first would be:  The AGON battle sheet. "Shots" in a Feng Shui game.  Hitpoints/modifiers in a D&amp;D game (my D&amp;D sheets tend to get worn through quickly right in that "hit points" box). XP for a TSOY game.  Oh, and absolutely that Marvel Supers game with the "resource stones": The character sheet for that game was nothing more than a paper that functioned as a board.<br/><br/>Thing is, none of the above (save AGON/Feng Shui) is really worth creating a whole board out of. It's just one small element that fluctuates out of several or dozens (the rest remain static or slow-changing).  So, I guess creating a "character board" or a "party board" or a "theme board" would be best for that Reason <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> above (functionality) if there are a FEW resources (more than one) that tend to change rapidly over the course of a single session.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I could totally see having a board when playing With Great Power.  In fact, the paper game aids that the GM uses to track the story arc and the place to put the card decks (both of which generally occupy the center of the game table) are essentially a board.  It just isn't a nice cardboard board with cool illustrations.                        </div>

                            Jason, I'm not talking about realism. The idea that a character can become more experienced in play (represented by gaining HP, which we know are experience abstractions, not a measure of health) not only by killing stuff, but by practicing a skill is quite justifiable.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that the way the rule is written that it gives the player an incentive to disarm absolutely every trap. Yep, it's actually profitable in the long run to open every trap you come across (has to be, really, or playing that character would be a disadvantage). Whether or not it's in the characters way, or whatever. Realism aside, this is just dull, dull, dull.<br/>
<br/>
The game is simply badly designed. As you agree, it's got the most fatal of flaws - an easily discerned optimal strategy set. Basically there are no decisions for the player to make when playing. The player is merely doing the work of pushing his token and rolling his dice to see if he "wins." Which proves nothing about player ability since everybody's going to be playing the optimal strategy.<br/>
<br/>
DULL!<br/>
<br/>
The game is relying entirely on the color of the game set to save it's ass. And it's pretty, sure. But that only takes me so far. Not far at all, actually.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, there's no place for role-playing in that game, unless you consider deciding where your pawn goes as role-playing. In which case Monopoly and Cadoo are role-playing games. Remember, I'm the guy who says that Universalis is not a RPG.<br/>
<br/>
Which is not to say that board-games aren't fun, or Universalis, or any other sort of game. I play them all. Just that the thrill I'm going to get from playing a game like the D&amp;D boardgame is more like Hero Clix than Hero Quest. A whole category apart.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shreyas, your point about maps vs boards is a good one. That is you can represent a lot more on a board than simply spatial relations.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I'm one of those text folks who doesn't prefer graphics to text. The thing is that you can make the board interesting itself, not just a visual aid. Like the example of Grey Ranks above. You could theoretically do that movement in your head, but it's orders of magnitude simpler to do it on the board.<br/>
<br/>
The board can include matters of strategy, of course, which makes it an important element itself. Similarly, just like Sorcerer bonus dice are not about strategy, but are an element to play around with that improves play in another way, so, too, could boards be used to be elements for more sim or nar play. I think Grey Ranks is already proof of this, but that it's just a start.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a real challenge. Come up with a way to make a map and minis, and spatial arrangement be useful for something other than strategy. How could we use that to, say, help create a story or myth?<br/>
<br/>
I want to use my minis again!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Facing is one thing I was thinking about, as well as simply sharing personal space and presence. Ability to communicate. Simple distance.<br/>
<br/>
Body language is tough with minis, and a lot easier to deal out using your own body. But there could be some way to indicate this on a board that might be a satisfying part of some sort of play.<br/>

                            I have an article on <br><br><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/mylifewithmaster/board.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Using a Board for My Life With Master</b></a><br><br>I haven't tried it yet, but I'm hopeful.  The one thing is that I'd like to make up a fancy-looking board rather than my dull diagram.  There's a lot of info which could be put on the board space.  <br><br>Also, I concur with saying that physical space and objects are part of story.  They're not typically part of literature because words aren't good at conveying physical positions.  However, detailed working with blocking in a play teaches a lot about the importance of physical space, facing, and relationships.  You get some of this in film, but it is less obvious because the medium is more dominated by the shifting point of view of the camera.  <br><br>I know that such physicality has played in a lot of games which I have run.  During the Buffy game I ran, the fights always had a symbolic aspect to them.  Most of the fights didn't use a map or figures, but a few did.  For example, one episode was called "The Glass Ceiling" and there was a big fight inside a pyramid where we used a map and figures.  They were fighting the Sluagh -- violent fairie spirits, but symbolically this was all about workplace power struggles.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Interesting conversation. I'm sad I'm arriving so late. I have a coupple quick thoughts.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Board as Story Progression</span><br>The Lord of the Rings game was mentioned already, but I hope Levi will chime in a bit about the Mission Control rules from <i>The Cog Wars</i>. At an early stage of development, there was almost a flow chart style adventure sequence. I believe his test group found it too board-game like, a fact that still makes me cry in my pillow at night. Still it was an experiment along similar lines for an rpg.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Miniatures and Vision Cards ( Everway)</span><br>I've been puttering with a game idea for a while using miniatures. A long time back, someone at The Forge suggested I check out Everway and the way it uses Vision Cards, since it had some parallels to how I was looking at minis.<br><br>Here is something I've noticed, a sort of RPGer Standard Procedure when using minis. The usual method is to make a character, figure everything out, then search for a mini to use. In a pinch, the mini doesn't even really matter-it's just a place holder, a position marker.<br><br>I think this is undercutting a potential value of the mini itself as inspirational material. It's a bit like coming up with a whole bunch of stuff, then finding the Everway cards that sort of kind of match if you squint. It's just plain bass-ackwards. Just like Vision cards, or any other visual item, the mini itself can serve as an insp[iration p[oint, something to start from and build on. Looking at minis as nothing but position markers is sort of silly to me.<br><br>Here's an excercise if you happen to have both minis and Everway cards around: Grab a mini and a Vision card of a "person". Let your mind wander. Check out the kinds of questions on the back of the Everway card. Now aqpply a similar process to the mini.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Tactical Minis</span><br>Did anyone else play with action figures or dolls as a kid? You know, back before you ever heard of wargames or rpgs?<br><br>The idea that toys ( in which I'd include gaming minis) are only of use as tactical, fidgety measuring whatsists is just a gamer habit. Kids playing with stuffed animals, model railroaders, little old ladies with holiday village set-ups, none of them are worried about tactical wargaming issues. They've gone straight to the heart of the thing and realized that the toys, in combination, imply a story, and very nuch an evolving one.<br><br>There is no reason that fidgety minis movement and ranges cannot be dispensed with entirely. Folks that participate here are very familiar with concepts like scene cutting &amp; framing, going directly for the crux of interest ( stakes, ConRes), all of which are ideas that could be used wih minis successfully.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What <i>I'd</i> like to see as a boardgame </span><br/><i>1001 Nights</i>.<br/>Seriously. I hope Meg won't be offended by that. I think that particular game could very well be translated to a board + cards boxed game, with the current game as we know it offered as an "advanced" version.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            The Grey Ranks and My Life With Master boards are nice. Essentially, though, they're state markers. There's no sense of play taking place on the board.<br/><br/>Imagine either of those two boards with the counters actually interacting: leapfrogging each other, say, or "pushing" each other around the board. Then you'd start using the board for what it's good for (as Ben says), as opposed to a replacement character sheet.<br/><br/>Robert, I really like the stuff about non-tactical minis. It reminds me of Mechaton.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Graham,<br/>have you ever played Stratego?  i mentioned this game earlier, 'cause i thought for the whole Gay Recruitment game it would be a bit more interesting if the players didn't know who was gay or not.  uncertainty can be good and tension building.  well, in Stratego there are Bomb pieces that you place on the board, in your allowed area.  all the pieces are turned to face the players, so your opponent doesn't know what piece is what.  these bombs can't move, and once an enemy piece challenges it(going into it's square), it blows up, along with the enemy piece...UNLESS that enemy piece is a Bombbadier, or named something like that.  this piece can deactivate the bombs without injury.  it'd be cool if there was a sort of gay expert, or Gaydarman, who could tell gays from's straights but would have to make contact with them.  <br/>you should check out Stratego.  you may not even have to "gay up" the pieces that much.  mustaches a plenty.<br/>yes, i was Stratego CRAZY as a kid.<br/>-Nate                        </div>

                            Stratego is a great game. The key with looking at designs and what to take from them, however, is not to consider them holistically, but to consider the principles that form them.<br/>
<br/>
Read your Game Theory (no, not RPG Theory, the math field). Stratego boils down to "Hidden Information" and "Rock, Paper, Scisors (RPS)" mechanics. Yes, 1 takes 2, and 2 takes 3 and so on down the line, but in the end 9 takes spy, an spy takes 1! And, yes, there's that internal variance that bomb takes all, except for 8, which takes bomb. A relatively complicated "Roshambo" mechanic, but basically the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
If you're familiar with the game theory behind it, the key to winning when such mechanics are present is to be unpredictable. To act randomly. Which is why somebody who puts his stratego board together randomly can sometimes seem to be a savant. Yes, the game is positional. But the more you move to take advantage of that, the more predictable you are, and the easier you are to beat.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, when putting together your board-game RPG, look for the underlying principles of the mechanics you steal, and how they're going to affect play. Graham is right about the examples. With Great Power's "board" is also somewhat a state thing, though the state does affect what you can play next. It's just a little "meta" to be felt as ongoing play.<br/>
<br/>
Bob's onto what I'm talking about. Non-tactical minis. I like the "Vision Minis" idea. I've always felt that Warhammer Illustrations were just begging to have answered what all of the darn warrior accoutremont was about. Why does that orc carry that particular skull around on his belt?<br/>
<br/>
The problem with board as plot channel is, well, it's a plot channel. If one could make it so that you can go "any direction" at any time, that would be an improvement, to me. If I'm playing in Middle Earth, I want to be able to play somebody other than the Fellowship, and I want to be able to go explore the Sea of Rhun if I like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah, I'm thinking in terms of turns and such. Like imagine a social game where your "move" each turn is to place your mini somewhere on the map (perhaps being able to move as far as you like), and that indicates who the character can interact with. You want to garner favor with the king? Go where he is. Ah, but the Baron is there with him now...do you want to risk his ridicule?<br/>
<br/>
Ever seen the French movie Ridicule?<br/>
<br/>
Versaille is an interesting place. When touring it, the basic fact of it's design became burned into my skull. I'd read abuot how Louis had built the place distinctly to control his courtiers. Essentially he'd allow himself a horse, but not others. If you've seen the grounds, you'd understand that this would mean that he could speak to whom he wanted, when he wanted, or get away from people. Or organize groups of people who he wanted to talk to each other. It's really a brilliant bit of planning that helped forge France into a nation-state by disempowering the nobility to scheme against the central authority.<br/>
<br/>
This is the example that always comes to my mind when I think about this sort of thing. But you see what I mean. Location on the map can simply be about who is in the presence of whom, and, as such, who one can interact with. As just one example of how one could make maps important to play.<br/>

                            Hey Mike:<br><br>Just on the irony bit, it was pondering about how I could use Universalis with minis as Tenet inspiration that got me thinking about this in the first place.<br><br>And just like setting a new scene in Uni doesn't require tactical movement, I figured there may not be any particular reason  to use it with minis, either. When a new scene/story-chunk is begun, players setting it can simply say who is present and where and set the thing up. The only real requirement is that it make sense with what has already been established in preceding story chunks.<br><br>If you get  chance, look up terms like Worldplay/Sand Tray ( or someimes Sand Play) therapy. It was built by an english jungian-school therapist named Margaret Lowenfeld (iirc). She based that on reading HG Wells' <i>Floor Games</i>, which was his book about playing non-wargame minis games with his kids.<br><br>As for the plot track idea, consider if what it tracked was more like Intro-&gt;1st crisis-&gt;resolution-&gt; blablablah &amp;c, rather than a physical tracking. Whether you go to Moria, or you go to the Sea of Rhun, plotwise, you're following along with a story rhythm. That's more what I was thinking, anyway.<br><br>Tangent: The comments about using a random pattern set-up for Stratego is funny, in that I believe Advanced Squad Leader suggests something similar as a tactic if you have defenses like barbed-wire entanglements or mines. Apparently it's common for an opponent randomly encountering the stuff to get themselves all worked up trying to figure out a non-existent pattern. The end result is that they start building up their own mental phantom enemies that threaten them and develop a bad case of the Go-Slows.<br><br>heh.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah, ironically the best response to opponent random play is simply to ignore it, and play with the data you do have. Good poker players who do not have tells, will sometimes show that they've bluffed even when they don't have to do so (opponent folded), just to put this fear into the minds of weak players. Good players ignore this, and only work from what they know.<br/>
<br/>
This is why, at it's highest level, poker goes from being a skill game, back to being totally gambling (why Moneymaker, a complete newb to the "pro" scene, could win the tournament one year, and Helmuth never does). It's only against weak players that skill means anything.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, again, that's the principle. Both RPS and hidden info are considered by good boardgame designers to be only good design elements if mixed strongly with other, more tactical, design elements. You want, in fact, for there to be better and worse strategies.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, you don't want a "known" game either, where the optimal strategy is easily discerned (hopefully, like chess, never discerned until some computer does soon).<br/>
<br/>
To get back to boards, one element that can provide this is non-board regulated movement. That is movement with a ruler. This is in part becase the skill in question becomes eyball ability to estimate distances, and a bewildering array of geometry problems that present themselves. Again, this seems to be a combat thing, but what if we did have movement rates on a map, and it was about whether or not you can intercept Louis on his horse at Versaille to ask him for a tax break for your Duchy? Then you have one such element to mix in with the more deterministic things like hidden info an d RPS mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
By combining these things we can create greater complexity to play, and avoid the pitfalls of optimal strategies.<br/>
