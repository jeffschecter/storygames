Three players, (male) Queen, Hollow, and Serpentine. There've already been a couple of assaults, minor police involvement, several vicious reputation-ruining efforts including sex photos and a PC planting drugs in another PC's locker, a confession of dangerous gay love between PC and PC, foreshadowing of future capital-B Badness, and a desperate secret murder!

I've gotta focus on finishing all the other Monsterhearts stuff (15 zines! a big print run! finishing this 3-part con scenario thing that got commissioned!) and a few life things (finishing this school semester! moving out of my house! dealing with a fractured pelvis! preparing to leave the country for 5 months!). But The Angel is brewing in my brain, and once I have a spare minute, it'll flood its way onto some paper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daftnewt" title="daftnewt"><img alt="daftnewt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daftnewt">daftnewt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368268/#Comment_368268" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T14:35:47+00:00" title="March 17, 2012  2:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2012 2:36PM by daftnewt.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite>How's the Queen working out?

The Serpentine looks awesome.<br/><br/><b>Failing Dynasty</b><br/><i>In the age of serpents, your family was powerful and prolific. Now, they live in a shadow of their former glory. They want to regain (choose one): their political clout; their old wealth; their failing beauty; their web of secret allegiances. Whenever you are convinced to do the bidding of a family member, carry 1 forward to doing it and that family member gains a String on you. Whenever you help your family regain some of their former glory, mark experience.</i><br/><br/>Such a great hook.  I want to play in a Veronica Mars-esque Monsterhearts game with a Serpentine from a "Kane-family-in-Neptune" clone.<br/><br/>Flipping through the Skins, I get so many ideas for TV series.  I like the idea of pitching a concept like a PTA pitch session, picking 5 Skins that fit that concept and *then* having players pick from among those few Skins.  They could always add moves from the other Skins later.  <br/><br/>All my ideas so far have one or two Mortal characters - that seems like a really critical archetype to me.  "Straight men" to make the monsters more monstrous, more forbidden.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368282/#Comment_368282" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T18:37:17+00:00" title="March 17, 2012  6:37PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Such a great hook.
