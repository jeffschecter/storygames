What makes it good for sandboxing?<br/><br/>I've been pondering a lot about this lately, reward cycles and whatnot. D&amp;D for example has the advantage for bribing you to seek treasure and kill monsters (depending on the edition), but what else can strengthen the structure of an "open-world" Step on Up game? Like, "here's your playground, full of challenges I wonder what you're going to do about." What games already support that out of the box, in your opinion, and what could be done better.<br/><br/>Be warned: I probably won't end up running anything you suggest, I just want to see what's on the table.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293353/#Comment_293353" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-14T13:00:00+00:00" title="September 14, 2010  1:00PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rolemaster<br/><br/>I really liked how characters changed thru violence.

The way I see it, a sandbox primarily has a map, mostly blank, with a few cool-sounding names written on it. Every time (perhaps in the very session, or perhaps a few days before) the players decide "I want to go there!" or "I want to see what's that thing!". The GM need not have the whole map filled out, but he should have enough prepared dungeons, NPCs and locales that he's prepared for every eventuality of "going there". Everywhere you go there should be cool stuff to find and stuff to fight. So...<br/>1. There should always be the feeling that the world is always bigger, that there is always something still left unexplored, something you missed. The world is NOT tailored to the PCs. There should be many times you have to run only to come back another day. Which brings me to...<br/>2. There is no baked-in situation. The world is passive and uncaring. There can be certain countdowns and threats, for example "If no-one goes into the Dreadcrag caves for a month, the goblins move back in and fortify them." (I guess in AW terms we could call them Fronts)<br/><br/>Which makes me agree with Brian and Johnstone, BW and Sorcerer are wrong. BW is all about characters in a situation. But that's for the other thread now.<br/><br/>I feel a Sandbox is much closer to a Right to Dream agenda (primarily, the GM's Right to Dream, there's a world, and it's just like <i>this</i> and it doesn't conform to any notions of literary meaning or character advocacy) and mostly the Step on Up agenda (in that there's a million things to find and fight, you always have to push harder, go further. If there is story, it's Story After ("Wasn't it cool when we beat the dragon and then the gnolls moved into his caves and we set the troglodytes on them!").<br/><br/>Now to the suggestions.<br/><br/><br/><b>Rolemaster</b> is, I think a cool suggestion. I think character change is important. Not only the scars but also power tripping. Besides the promise of another treasue over yonder hill, a player also has the promise of that next cool sword move he'll get. But alas, I am a lesser man.<br/><br/><b>Reign</b> is interesting, the company rules would make for a particular kind of sandbox, but again, I think it would require a lot more <i>situation</i>. I think in Reign the GM hast to pit the PCs group versus NPC groups in a fairly balanced and story-driving manner. But would make an interesting game. However, my group doesn't like the ORE engine, and it doesn't really work for me either.<br/><br/><b>Various iterations of D&amp;D</b> have, as I mentioned in my OP, the advantage of rewarding players for monsters and treasure. Also, I really really like how Lamentations of the Flame Princess looks and works. I think it would be a good choice in general. But I'm dead tired of running anything D&amp;D-ish. LotFP might be just different enough, but I'm not cool with some of the basic assumptions of D&amp;D mechanics and I dislike the system/play culture that our group has developed to deal with D&amp;D.<br/><br/><b>Traveller</b> is another very interesting suggestion. Ara, I'd particularly like to hear more about "All the rewards are in the fiction." I've been thinking about fictional rewards, fictional consequences and fictional cues a lot lately. Another thread maybe? I haven't played Traveller but I can see how it would work. I'm pretty sure I once saw a full blown fantasy hack for it somewhere.<br/><br/><b>Donjon</b> is awesome but I think it's too lightweight and takes away a big chunk of "GM authored, uncaring world" which I think is essential for a sandbox.<br/><br/>Last but not least, <b>Apocalypse World</b>. I love AW. I love it to bits. However, I believe it is, again, a game about situation. I haven't yet seen anyone do it the "let's go there today" mode. It's always about people and relationships and what's going on here, now. There is never an opportunity for the players to explore or take on challenges, because the shitstorm is already in your face when you wake up every day. I guess it could work, but I'm not sure how. It would blow all the GM's prep out of the water each time. There would be no NPC-PC-NPC triangles. Frankly, I feel it would fall apart as an AW game and turn into something else, which brings me to...<br/><b>Dungeon World/Apocalypse D&amp;D</b> I like these a lot, too. I think it could work great, my main problem with this suggestion is that I see it working well for small instances of play, where you're in a dungeon and you beat a dungeon and it's over. Perhaps I'm wrong and it is because it's getting a lot of Con play, but I see it as the kind of game where there are many isolated instances of a single dungeon adventure, but no persistent world to tie them all together. I suspect this is also because the game lacks a lot of AW's GM stuff like Fronts. Dungeon World should have MC moves like "migrate monsters" or "increase monster population" and custom moves like "When you don't go into the Dreadcrag caves for a month, roll +charisma. On 10+ a dude in the next village tells you the goblins are repopulating the caves en masse, on 7-9 someone mentions they've seen a few goblins around again. On a miss you're clueless."<br/><br/>Jesse, I'm going to take a look at Black Fire now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293444/#Comment_293444" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T07:17:18+00:00" title="September 15, 2010  7:17AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, OK--not my idea of a sandbox.

I think it's a very Right to Dream format, but probably less supportive of Step on Up play.  The latter would seem to require more mechanical "fairness" (but I could be misunderstanding the Big Model).<br/><br/>That said, I've been thinking a bit about how to use that most Step on Up game, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 4e, for a great big explore-the-map-and-roll-for-wandering-monsters sandbox game.  The idea of such an open world runs counter to 4e's rigorous ideals of game balance, and doesn't offer a lot of support for the kind of carefully-concocted set piece combat encounters that make 4e really sing, so it's probably a wrongheaded idea from the start.  I think it could be a lot of fun, though, at least over a narrow spread of levels.<br/><br/>The other system that immediately comes to mind is <em>Legends of Anglerre</em>, or some other Fate-derived fantasy game.  The obvious benefit of Fate for a sandbox game is the ease of coming up with new content.

I love AW. I love it to bits. However, I believe it is, again, a game about situation. I haven't yet seen anyone do it the "let's go there today" mode. It's always about people and relationships and what's going on here, now. There is never an opportunity for the players to explore or take on challenges, because the shitstorm is already in your face when you wake up every day. I guess it could work, but I'm not sure how. It would blow all the GM's prep out of the water each time. There would be no NPC-PC-NPC triangles. Frankly, I feel it would fall apart as an AW game and turn into something else, which brings me to...<br/><b>Dungeon World/Apocalypse D&amp;D</b>I like these a lot, too. I think it could work great, my main problem with this suggestion is that I see it working well for small instances of play, where you're in a dungeon and you beat a dungeon and it's over. Perhaps I'm wrong and it is because it's getting a lot of Con play, but I see it as the kind of game where there are many isolated instances of a single dungeon adventure, but no persistent world to tie them all together. I suspect this is also because the game lacks a lot of AW's GM stuff like Fronts. Dungeon World should have MC moves like "migrate monsters" or "increase monster population" and custom moves like "When you don't go into the Dreadcrag caves for a month, roll +charisma. On 10+ a dude in the next village tells you the goblins are repopulating the caves en masse, on 7-9 someone mentions they've seen a few goblins around again. On a miss you're clueless."</blockquote>\nI think to make AW work you would have to create a tiered front system.  After laying out the map, you'd have to have macro-fronts that are sweeping, world-changing, events like nations at war.  Under these, you could have a list of all the places where you could interact with the front (PCs could go to these places).  Instead of having a clock with numbers for the front, I would make a micro-front for each number.  The micro-fronts would work like normal fronts but when they came to a head you would mark it off on the macro-front.  The micro-fronts would represent places the PCs could go to interact with the macro-front.  In this way you have little things going on that drive the sweeping events (e.g. the macro front is the elves are going to attack the dwarfs -&gt; a microfront is troops building up on the boarder [must happen before the macro-front goes critical] -&gt; threats resulting from the troop buildup include local MPs hunting for spies, the leader of the citizenry demanding concessions from the massing troops, the strange disease that seems to be spreading in the camp, etc.).  Wherever the players go, they can deal with local threats/micro-front and then you can just play with the macro-fronts to drive the world story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VacuumJockey" title="VacuumJockey"><img alt="VacuumJockey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VacuumJockey">VacuumJockey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293999/#Comment_293999" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T05:51:49+00:00" title="September 20, 2010  5:51AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some kind of D&amp;D is well suited to sandbox play. Much depends on the players; my players are not fond of anything <i>less </i>complex than D&amp;D3E or Pathfinder. Our group have internalized much of 3E, so our games flow well i.e. all but the most intense combat situations can be handled in less than half an hour. But I do feel that - in general terms - less complex systems are more suited for sandbox play, as they give more leeway for easy improvisation. This is clearly a matter of personal preference, and YMM very well V.<br/><br/>So I'd suggest...:<br/>One of the early D&amp;Ds or one of their clones - <a href="http://www.goblinoidgames.com/labyrinthlord.html" rel="nofollow">Labyrinth Lord</a> would be a good one.<br/>Chaosiums Basic Roleplaying with the <a href="http://basicroleplaying.com/showthread.php/1645-CLASSIC-FANTASY-A-Return-to-the-Dawn-of-Roleplaying" rel="nofollow">Classic Fantasy </a> supp would be another good one.<br/>QUERP is a good and simple game, well suited for sandbox play<br/>And so is <a href="http://www.stargazergames.eu/games/warrior-rogue-mage/" rel="nofollow">Warrior, Rogue &amp; Mage </a>.

Burning Wheel qualifies on the weaves in front though requires skilled handler to use sandboxy, Mouseguard might be a slightly better choice if you accept a mouse-sized sandbox.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294038/#Comment_294038" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T10:03:02+00:00" title="September 20, 2010 10:03AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob<br/>\n<br/>\nIt Depends who is using the term sandbox.  In some circles it's become tied to the old school usage and the way that many of the early D&amp;D; games were played.  In that style huge dungeons were detailed ahead of time and the elaborate tactical setups were the norm.  Half of the fun for the DM was creating the dungeons ahead of time and the sandbox was more related to players being free to wander around to whatever location interested them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that usage of the term is a bit limited and restricts the usefulness.  A sandbox is a space where kids play and make up things based on what they have and what they find.  I think your ideas match that concept quite well but someone who is looking to the old scholl usage of the term wont see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294210/#Comment_294210" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-21T17:06:28+00:00" title="September 21, 2010  5:06PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2010 5:07PM by MacLeod.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would go for Basic Fantasy RPG.
