It's a GM-less story game system that encourages a certain style of "storyplaying". At the same time, it is highly modular and can be adapted for different styles of play.<br/><br/>Now, I'd like to introduce the basic game structure and see if you find the terminology &amp; basic structure accessible:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/mrWDKVk.png"/><br/>A collection of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/storyplaying" rel="nofollow">handouts for Directions Storyplaying System is available here</a> for further reference.<br/><br/>Essentially, <i>Directions</i> is mildly pushing you towards playing with a less structured game flow; while there is a structured framework as fall back and to get you started.<br/>So, you basically oscillate between:<br/>  - <i>Group Reflection</i> out-of-character, possibly including host rotation or new plots.<br/>  - <i>Structured Storyplaying</i> using more formalized scene framing.<br/>  - <i>Free Storyplaying</i> with free game flow and rudimentary structures (not necessarily freeform play).<br/><br/>Of course, depending on your group's playing style, the game may have a completely different grativational center for you, i.e.<br/>- Free Storyplaying for the group that likes free flowing roleplaying,<br/>- Group Reflection for the those more inspired by "storyboarding",<br/>- Structured Storyplaying for those who prefer roleplaying structured scenes.<br/><br/>So, my question is less about your preferred style of playing. It's more if you can basically understand the terminology &amp; structure presented here and if these make sense to you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463501/#Comment_463501" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-21T23:55:31+00:00" title="May 21, 2017 11:55PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is pretty interesting.

While the current Host basically can frame scenes and pull the story in certain directions, it is important to involve all players and find a common ground.<br/>Reflection in the group intends to<br/>1. generate new ideas/inspiration for the shared story<br/>2. ensure everybody is on the same page where the story is headed<br/><br/>While this is possible in conversation, there are additionally tools like the <i>Compass</i> and the <i>Surprise Meter</i> that help you with this (both I've previously presented on story-games).<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/Fh6iF3a.png"/><br/> <br/>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compass</span> provides an opportunity for each player to give feedback, like i.e. they'd like to see more action scenes or intimate dialogues (or they have needs beyond the story, like needing a break).<br/><br/>While players can agree on where the story should be heading, it is also good to stay open for unplanned surprises.<br/>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surprise Meter</span> indicates <i>how much</i> in game play things work out as planned or go in unexpected directions.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463519/#Comment_463519" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-22T17:18:19+00:00" title="May 22, 2017  5:18PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha!

I think "Group reflection" is more important than people think and especially where people should reflect, together, what has happened to the story. Reinforcing the theme, is probably something I'm missing, and it doesn't have to be in the group but the game mechanics can do that or just the structure of how scenes are set up. Sometimes, people tend to forget about what kind of atmosphere - or even playstyle - they should endorse.<br/><br/>I can't say much without ... not an examples, but troubles in shared narrative that you normally would find in a group that your structure of play can breathe through.<br/><br/>Another thing that I think is really backwards in roleplaying games is that you create characters <i>first</i> and then play out a story. It doesn't make any sense, and when I asked (read: forced :P ) my girlfriend - who were playing amateur theater at the time - to create a character to my game, she didn't understand the purpose of skills and abilities. This because I hadn't set the theme or told anything about what the game was about.

I recognize the compass I already liked and picked to communicate just this : "now we get to choose what <i>kind</i> of story we're gonna tell".<br/><br/>More on topic, I would go for more "active" wordings. The problem is obvious in "Brief reflection". I wanted to suggest "the show so far" because it talks loads, but it doesn't mean precisely what it should. Maybe in 3 times "The show so far" "Where we're at" "and where we're heading". The idea of a recapitulation is very important, even if you don't like it. It . Just. Works. for everybody.<br/><br/>Well, of course with MY game, all the reflective work, scene framing and stuff is already built-in in the player's actions together with their motivation for action and strategy, so... see you on some other topic (what about "games powered by desire") :P <br/><br/>No really, this sounds very reflexive. I have come to the conclusion through experiment that there is an amount of TIME to get on the same page without limiting creative input <i>a priori</i>. It takes around 45 minutes for 4-6 players whatever procedures I propose, we just need to not be talking about pizza flavours. If you tell me you do less, I will gladly incorporate your procedures in my game.
