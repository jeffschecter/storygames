I've spoken with Seth Ben-Ezra &amp; John Harper about it some, and I thought I would post some initial thoughts here.<br/><br/>Free free to chime in. As I get time and inclination, I'll actually write up some playbooks and whatnot.<br/><br/>The core changes:<br/>* The tentative title for this is Unknown World. Not the greatest title, but it works for now.<br/><br/>* There is no Weird stat. Everything in UW is a Weird stat to someone. But since I like the distribution of five stats, I'm replacing Weird with Money -- it Alex Abel stat. It works like Circles &amp; Resources in BW. Of course, it doesn't just mean "money" -- that's just a sexy name for "I have dudes and stuff at my fucking disposal."<br/><br/>* The Street/Global/Cosmic paradigm is represented in improvement. The "advanced" improvement you can do after five improvements is Global level. After that is Cosmic.<br/><br/>* Each adept &amp; archetype is its own playbook. There are some "normal" characters, too, for enforcers, cabal leaders, etc.<br/><br/>* Some basic moves will change, of course. Opening your mind is something I'm completely striking, in lieu of all the other weirdness in UA.<br/><br/>* Highlighting will work differently. Each playbook will tell you what your Obsession Stat is (otherwise known as Ox). That's highlighted. Then the group highlights another stat each time by some mechanism I have yet to decide on. (In some cases, the playbook will tell you you can choose between a could stats for Ox. And if you take on a new playbook, it must have the same Ox that you already have. Ox should feel limiting.)<br/><br/>* There needs to be another form of Harm for Madness. I neither like the idea of just one meter or all five, though.<br/><br/>* I've given most of my thought to adept playbooks. Each have moves for gaining charges &amp; taboo, and can choose from a number of formula spells as moves. This makes the game feel rather different because the blast spells are effectively Going Aggro...except with Ox rather than Hard. So every adept is fucking dangerous. And crazy. I like it.<br/><br/>* Possible Oxs for some schools: Entropomancy is Cool (you're risking your shit all the time), Epideromancy is Hard (you're fucking cutting into yourself), Pornomancy is Hot (you're a manipulative fucker), Cliomancy is Sharp (you're a goddamned history mage), Plutomancy is Money (duh). Some are hard to peg into one, so you get to choose what your Ox is: Dipsomancy could be Cool or Sharp (you're either a super-chillax drunk or a sharp-minded drunk), Bibliomancy is Sharp or Money (either it's feeding your mind or the resources of books at your disposal is your power), etc.<br/><br/>* I'm ambivalent about keeping/dropping the sex moves. They don't feel right for UA out of the box, but there will be some thematic/content drifting with this hack. It's not about making AW fit UA, but about marrying the two to make something awesome. Or, at least getting them to swap genetic filth all over a dirty alley while we watch.<br/><br/>* There's no barter. This is not a world of material scarcity but the scarcity of power. Plus, that's what the Money stat is for.<br/><br/>Seriously, this idea is on fucking fire in my mind.<br/><br/>- Ryan                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292094/#Comment_292094" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T16:31:55+00:00" title="September  7, 2010  4:31PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am going to be intensely curious to see how money holds up.

Right now I'm forgoing the Madness cost thing in favor of something more along the lines of Sorcerer's Humanity.  I'm dropping Sex moves too but want to have other incentives for fostering connections with the other PCs and NPCs and Contenders is my model there at the moment.

A few thoughts:\n<ul>\n<li>The games of UA I've played in/run have each had a PC with a weird talent: the ability to smell magick in one, the ability to understand the speech of cats in another. Maybe PCs should have the ability to take some kind of custom weird move from the get-go?</li>\n<li>Along those lines, a wide variety of playbooks for non-adepts and non-avatars would be key. Though I almost wonder if rolling custom playbooks for all PCs might be a way of handling the variety of characters you can get in UA, <i>and</i> capture the spirit of roll-your-own skills.</li>\n<li>Were it me, I'd rename "Money" as "Pull", to capture the notion that at least as much about influence as it is cash flow. </li>\n<li>I love the notion of charging moves, and wonder if it shouldn't just be an Obsession move that focuses on dragging other characters into your own twisted worldview.</li>\n</ul>\nI really love this idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292269/#Comment_292269" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T12:35:09+00:00" title="September  8, 2010 12:35PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another suggestion for sex moves (warning, its been awhile since I've played Unknown Armies, so I might get a few names for things mixed up) could be to associate them somehow with the types of stress you get. One of the things that I thought always worked really well in Unknown Armies were the Hardness(name?) sliding scales. Violence could throw you down the deep end as easy as the Unknown. So maybe the Sex Moves could be some kind of Coping Mechanism that the PC's use to help each other cope with the madness of the unreal. Of course, sex could still be an option there.<br/><br/>You would have to make so many playbooks! Mundane to Mancers to Avatars. That'll be tricky, not sure how to capture that. I like what Jim's thinking in the post above though.<br/><br/>Also, this of course sounds neat. Not a huge fan of percentile system. Huge fan of Apocalypse World.

Awesome!  UA is my all-time favorite game, and AW is my favorite game of the past couple years, the combination is brilliant!<br/><br/>My thoughts:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>* Each adept &amp; archetype is its own playbook. There are some "normal" characters, too, for enforcers, cabal leaders, etc.</blockquote>That's a metric fuck-ton of playbooks.  And it's going to be weird if you have the "global" improvement to switch playbooks as adepts shouldn't be able to switch to new adepts, and... probably the same with archetypes too, unless they're willing to give up all the moves that came with their old archetype.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Plutomancy is Money (duh).</blockquote>Got a question about this.  it <i>sounds</i> "duh," but I'm not so sure.  Does rolling+Money frequently or usually represent dropping some cash?  If so... well... Plutomancers are all about <i>acquiring</i> money, but the bastards live like paupers.  They don't spend the stuff unless there's no other choice.<br/><br/>In fact, that leads, in general to an issue I have with the idea of Ox.  In UA, you're better with your Obsession skill.  In AW, you're not necessarily good with what you've got highlighted.  It just gives you experience.  It seems like Ox should give you a bonus to using the stat, not experience.  But I dunno, that's just a gut reaction.<br/><br/>Moves for spells, channels, charging, etc. sounds absolutely <i>perfect</i> though.  That alone makes me suspect UA is an excellent pick for an AW hack.<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing what comes of this.

I know that Mouse Guard and PTA does for me, and it looks like AW may have slightly codified ways to GM that make it easier.<br/><br/>I'd really love to play UA again one of these days, but I don't really know how to GM it in a satisfying way. If a hack does that, great.
