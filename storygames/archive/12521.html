I've put together a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/store.html" rel="nofollow">store webpage</a> where you'll find four quick-and-dirty games being sold in PDF format for $2 each. These games are:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Knuckleheads!</b>:  a slapstick RPG in the Three Stooges/Laurel &amp; Hardy vein<br/>\n<b>Construction &amp; Conquest</b>: a customized wargame using LEGO<br/>\n<b>Crow's Hoard</b>: a card game similar to Hearts, but a lot crazier, and<br/>\n<b>Caffeine &amp; Nicotine Live Action Roleplay</b>: an experimental RPG inspired by the film <i>Coffee &amp; Cigarettes</i><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, if you like <i>Super Action Now!</i> or <i>The Rustbelt</i> or <i>MADcorp</i> and you want me to be able to keep designing, buy these games, and talk your friends into buying them. They're cheap and short. I've played them all and they're all fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I don't understand automated PDF stuff, so I'm just gonna email the things out to the people who buy 'em. I only get to go online a couple of hours every day, so bear with me if you don't get 'em right away.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281762/#Comment_281762" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T14:48:01+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  2:48PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To answer some questions I've been getting asked:<br>Yes, Knuckleheads!, Crow's Hoard, and Caffeine &amp; Nicotine have been posted on my blog and/or Story Games in some form in the past where you can still see them. And, yes, since then they've seen playtesting and have been revised to make them better. Plus, these PDFs are prettier than forum posts. Especially Knuckleheads!, its layout is very charming.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
