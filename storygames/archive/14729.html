However, I am wondering if anyone has played the game, and how well does it work? It seems like a pretty reasonable system, and I'd like to demonstrate it to my Star Wars Saga Edition group for an alternative perspective.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334955/#Comment_334955" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T17:42:15+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  5:42PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, we only talk about <b><i>NEW</i></b> games here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334956/#Comment_334956" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T17:45:31+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  5:45PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2011 5:45PM by Andy.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Just kidding!</b> Actually, it's kinda funny, just this AM I was thinking of a campaign to start threads/discussion/play of Games that Time Eventually Forgot here at Story Games (stuff <b>EXACTLY</b> like Paladin or other older/not-played-as-much favorites).<br/><br/>Honestly, I played it YEARS ago, about three times, and unfortunately for the life of me I can't recall a single rule from it, save for the "good/evil 'jedi' scale". I need to look up my document.<br/><br/>Have you played it at all? If so, please spill how it went!<br/><br/>I recall having issues with it back in the day, as I thought the rules had "holes" in them, but today I could probably go back and totally rock it knowing what I know now in terms of directing play. <br/><br/>It's a good fit for Star Wars of course... but I honestly think that it really shines in the default setting, or a setting of your own division.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335142/#Comment_335142" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T15:55:56+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  3:55PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously?
