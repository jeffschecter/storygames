I don't know if I'm translating his idea correctly.  But the idea I'm coming up with is something I'm curious to have folks that HAVE DONE commission work and writing work - to poke holes in.  Figure out the problems.  See if some form of this idea is workable and fair.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>The idea is to have an open call for writing submissions on a project.<br/>Submissions would be geared toward the product description/goal with guidelines,  primarily NPC origin/background story and stats.<br/>The creator finishes the idea, submits it to the book project planner.<br/>When the NPC/background is approved, the creator is given the contact info for a (pre-established) artist that will illustrate the character idea.  <br/>The creator pays the (pre-set) fee for the character and the image/character idea is submitted to the book project planner.<br/>The project planner organizes all of these submissions and the new art created for them and lays them out in the book to be published.<br/><br/>When the book is published the creators (all) get a free-complimentary copy (perhaps even 2-5 copies to give friends) of the entire collection (either PDF or Print or both).  Therefor "paying" them for their submission with a substantial book supplement,  as well as giving them writing credits for their idea.<br/><br/>The artist is one set up by the book project planner.  Either a single artist or a few artists that are the only options for illustrating for the book, to keep consistency in style.  The artist could be set up to either get the full commission  or  set it up to have the book project planner be a sort of "middle man"... or rather like an Agent for the artist.  The artist is getting (potentially) a steady flow of art commissions.  As the writing for the project is being created  (with approval and direction from the planner).  Either the artist getting the full commission or working out a plan 80/20 % commission pay for the Artist and book planner.<br/><br/><br/>Where are the problems, holes, potential downfalls,  concerns.  Or good thoughts about this idea?<br/><br/>NOTE...<br/>I am not asking or suggesting this in some sort of "break-the-bank" scheme acting as a project planner.  I know that much of our niche hobby is about creation and love of the project.  But in this I'm seeing the option to create quality products with a unifyied theme that also allows new amateur creators a chance to get published  at  the same time producing a good deal of material  and  giving them a "payment" in free product.  <br/>Sort of like  creating  a submission  and buying the art for your creation  acting as a "pre-order"  to the overall project book in the end.<br/><br/>thoughts??                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309413/#Comment_309413" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T20:03:05+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  8:03PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason Morningstar has done some collaborative work similar to this (see Story Games Names Project).

I disagree with all of them for various reasons that I think each are taking this *idea* and twisting it into a  "EVIL CHEAT SCAM"  against pure-hearted naive writers and creators that are having their little toys taken by the evil evil scam artists.<br/><br/>That's hogwash.<br/><br/><br/>The POINT of this idea is to help the amateur writer/creators  and/or  the creators that are not as active or willing to actively work to find ways to get there work published.  And honestly, also for those creators that... are not (yet) so talented and need practice, etc...<br/>The POINT is also to help an organizer/publisher (and creator themselves)  to gather  similar  ideas to quickly produce something cool to add to the gaming line.  You do "get what you pay for" but then again, a seed of an awesome idea written badly might spark great ideas in the reader for home game fun or to create their own article/publication spin...<br/><br/>No one is forcing anyone to volunteer... So there's no cheating anyone.  If a creator thinks it's worth it, great!  If not, move along... No worries.  In my experience it's the creator that thinks WAY too much of themselves and is worried about having their ideas stolen in whatever means that actually aren't that good in end anyway.  For a creator, ideas are valuable - but the great thing about creators that inspire me is that even if/WHEN their idea gets taken or used in some way ... they don't get mad - they think of NEW ideas.  Creativity is a gift that keeps giving.  <br/><br/>The internet is a great equalizer.  <br/><br/>However,  there are some creators that just don't have the initiative to go publish or create on their own.  Some great things might never see the light of day because of "my day job" keeps me from creating that awesome "thing" ... then languishing in the mire of (the hard part for many people)  of how and where to get it published so that a larger fanbase can SEE the creation.  Just publishing it on my blog will have my mom and my 5 best pals, and maybe my girlfriend seeing it... But submitting my idea to a collection of ideas that will be open for hundreds/thousands of fans to see my work (alongside the others in the collaboration)  is a great benefit that many creators can't do,  don't have time for,  or are just frozen by the challenge of where/how to publish it themselves.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that it's hard to figure that stuff out.  But it is something that some people just can't or don't want to do.  So, this idea is an outlet if nothing else.<br/><br/><br/>If you're one of those people,  or god-forbid maybe you WANT to "give" something to the fanbase even though you normally get paid to write... then the value  IS  worth it and the "theft-of-services"  is a mute and frankly bullshit argument.<br/><br/><br/>People.<br/>I'm not looking to steal anyone's work.  I'm not looking to cheat anyone.  I'm not even ready to say that I honestly WOULD use this method of development.  What I am saying is that I saw the idea and it SEEMED like a good idea.  I am NOT looking for whining or badmouthing on the idea.  I'm looking for the problems, questions to ask/consider (and benefits) that could be had on BOTH sides of the deal.<br/><br/>thanks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309625/#Comment_309625" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T19:49:02+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  7:49PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, here is a problem: the content submitters have to jump through hoops, and then are expected to pay an artist they didn't choose to illustrate a book that they won't profit from.

But you're framing it negatively and mean-spirited.  <br/>They do submit their article without immediate payment.  <br/>The creator does pay for art.  However, the art would likely be more cost effective assuming the planner of the project and the artist to be contracted arrange a "special" for each submission, going with a quantity of immediate WORK.  From what I've seen, the art for an original color character (if this is a NPC character book)  would be closer to:  $15-35  max.<br/><br/>However...<br/>I'm pretty sure the "incentive" to have the creators "jump through hoops" isn't really to harm anyone, or even make it hard.  And not to take advantage.  I believe the idea was that ... <br/><br/>A creator comes up with a character (or organization or hazard or whatever)  and is interested in submitting it to this publication.  The planner of the publication responds saying "Yes, this is in-line with the theme of what we want. We'd like to accept it - here's the info for the artist we're using.  Contact them and have your work illustrated. The artist will contact us when done."  Then the creator contacts the artist and does the detail work on getting the art done.  At the VERY LEAST the creator has (buys) a great piece of art  (perhaps at a reduced cost than they normally might get, if the planners/artist has a deal going to make it a little more cost effective).  And they submit the work,  get it in a published product along with a dozen (or more)  like minded articles - that might make the work seen by MORE of a fanbase than they normally could muster alone.  Then they also get a complimentary copy (call it paid for with the cost of their art commission)  when the work is published.  <br/><br/><br/><b>This creator,  who is likely a fan of the game material too.

Should be telling.</blockquote>\n<br/>No offense intended Mcdaldno, but "people" (the majority thusfar) have not really given breakdowns of problem points.  There's been complaining about how awful this idea is... but not reasons that I feel break the model for amateur writers. <br/><br/><br/>On "loses writers money":  I don't think this is necessarily targeted at professional writers. <br/><br/>On "writing is less valuable than art":  Sometimes that IS true. Like it or not. That said - art catches the audience but (I would also say) the writing keeps them coming back or at least signifies the quality.  Still, it's easier to GET an audience with shiny colors and cool images than it is a text file - no matter how KEWL the idea is.  If this idea is a NPC character book, the art of a character WILL catch the eye and make me want to read the backstory, the stats, and present the NPC in my game much more quickly.  Good writing IS valuable, but it can work better with good art to GET the attention to sell the good writing.<br/><br/>On "value":  I noted that up-thread.  There's plenty of value offered to the creator and the publisher.  No direct paycheck (to either) but there's still value.<br/><br/>On "complicated":  Are you kidding?  Submit idea - Get idea approved - Commission art - Get final product.  That's WAY less complicated (to me as a writer) than what I'd have to do and figure out  (if I'm doing it from scratch)  to get my work created and produced in a larger marketed publication that I have to do all myself... or try to break into the industry untested with no experience to show completely.<br/><br/>On "profit":  The biggest (only?) actual profit I can imagine for a niche market like RPGs is the "profit" the audience of the game gets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'm going to stop trying to give explanation here.  And I'll stop reading the bleeding hearts for the poor writers are being screwed points of view.  <br/><br/>I have noted that I would gladly submit my own work/writing to such a publication for and despite the current pros/cons I've seen.  I was/am looking for things that actually change that point of view I have on this business model.  <br/>That said.<br/>I will likely put my money where my mouth is (literally)  by submitting some of my  AMATEUR  writing to a publication (where I heard this idea from).  That's one big reason I'm looking for the "holes".  As yet.  I've not seen any, as I disagree with the things presented so far.  Not saying that in a snarky way... just saying.<br/><br/>Thanks all.<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309656/#Comment_309656" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T23:17:06+00:00" title="January 25, 2011 11:17PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite>I don't think this is necessarily targeted at professional writers.</blockquote>\nWell, if it's going to be a fan publication, not professional, what's to make it better than just taking my Google Doc to Kinko's and getting it put in a decent binding? Like, why would I, a fan of whatever game this is about, take this route, which will cost me more money, do this rather than just post my idea on a web page, or a wiki somewhere? I'll get better distribution to people who are more likely to use my stuff by putting it up for free somewhere and indexing it well and chatting about it on forums.  What am I paying for? <br/><br/>The art? Well, I can get that myself if I'm willing to pay, it ain't that hard to hit some websites and find someone cool who will do up my character right, I can write them a check as much as I can write you a check.<br/><br/>A print copy with all the fan stuff together? Maybe, but what kind of print copy? Like, is it a decent, well-bound, well-organized book with a good index? Maybe, I mean, fan material is really uneven and normally pretty specialized to their own particular tastes and needs? That's not a bad thing about fan material, it's a good thing. But I normally am not willing to pay very much for fan material for just that reason. (I'll pay for professional writing that has been well-edited, because <i>it is better.</i>  By the way, I don't see any provision for editing in this? Who would pay for that?)  And how are you going to get a kickass print copy cheap enough to make this worth it to me?<br/><br/>You really are running up against a hard wall because even in amateur/fan publications, there is an enormous history of "well, just submit us something for free, it will be advantageous for you in some way" being an absolute lie in every possible way forever. I mean, probably two weeks after Gutenberg put together the printing press there was probably some asshole posting and saying "Send me 25 bucks and your short story and it'll be in this great new anthology!" I'm not saying you are as wicked or degraded as these persons, but sometimes the smell of the gutter covers up the daintiest flowers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309661/#Comment_309661" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T23:56:33+00:00" title="January 25, 2011 11:56PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2011 1:46PM by TylerT.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the past board game and card game companies have done mass submission style projects. the ones that work have a few qualities I can identify.<br/><br/>Low investment for submitter<br/>-the rule for a tcg card, a very small expansion for a board game, or a costume design.<br/><br/>High involvement and development by trained professionals.<br/>- self explanatory, it takes skills to make something people will pay for.<br/><br/>I hear these processes never save time or effort.<br/><br/>There have been a few collaborative books lately like <br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hobby-Games-Best-James-Lowder/dp/1932442960" rel="nofollow">hobby games: the 100 best </a><br/><br/>I'm not sure how these get made, but I imagine James Lowder is someone with a good amount of connections, contacts, and few owed favors!<br/><br/>Maybe these books are like talk shows, people agree to be a guest because the status of the show actually means something for the success of their current project and career.<br/><br/>I could see a big name being able to pull of a story game equivalent but really I dont think anyone here has enough visibility to exchange for submissions.<br/><br/>____<br/><br/>Oh yeah, like everyone else has put fourth, the plan resembles many of the devices used to fool, con, and harm desperate people. speck work, work for "exposure" and everything else is terrible exploitation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309663/#Comment_309663" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T00:11:10+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 12:11AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mr.Perrine, I truly read no bias in the comments that are being given here. And if they are nearly unanimous, that must mean something. <br/><br/>Personally, I see in my country a lot of people getting "paid" with copies of the final work for their translations (even in the soidisant indie rpg industry, yes), but that's no payment in my opinion. <br/>I may be just too used to dealing with mainstream rpg industry, but when I used to illustrate sourcebooks for White Wolf, having <i>two</i> copies of the book shipped to me for free was a conditio sine qua non which was part of the contract, not of the payment. Then there was the payment too. <br/>When I worked in Japan in the manga industry, sample copies were always given for free to publisher whose works were being translated and reedited/reprinted.<br/>That is, I am given to know that in the whole publishing business sample copies of the work one has done, be he translator, graphic, illustrator, are most often included as a mere part of the contract. Turning them into part of the reward/payment sounds very wrong to me.<br/><br/>And yes, together with others I see an imbalance between the reward that would be given to writers and the one which would be given to illustrators. I should be happy about that because I'm an illustrator first and foremost, but I can't say I find such a deal fair. If in an rpg work art is more valuable than writing, then automatically writing is going to be mediocre at best. Because it's nonrewarded (let's be honest about this!). Why should one then buy such a book? Would an art book not be better?<br/><br/>It's not a dogpiling. We're giving you the analysis and opinion you requested.

Historically this has not been a respected practice in writing, and for a reason: vanity publishing generates value for the publisher not by servicing the public but rather by downplaying the value of the creative work and exaggerating the ill-defined publisher services provided by the benefitting party, going to such extremes that the poor victim starts thinking that it's right and proper for him to actually pay for the right to associate with these respectable "professionals" who so kindly are willing to take his money and publish his writing. Although there are many ways you can set up a vanity publishing endeavour, they are simple to recognize as what they are by following the money: if the publisher has a vested interest in publishing your work not because it's good but because the mere act of taking you on is generating them income, then what you have is a vanity publishing operation. Real publishers make their living by selling works to the public, not by selling services to the creator.<br><br>The twist in this particular case is that the direct beneficiary is the artist and not the publisher (except for the free IP he's getting). If this seems like a fair set-up, do consider this: would it still be fair if the artist and the publisher were the same person? Because that's what I would totally expect if I saw this floated seriously somewhere.<br/><br/>As to why exactly everybody is ragging on this thing, it's because we know from our own experience that the publishing world does not work the way vanity publishing legend says it does: there is no "writing credit" that makes up for lack of skill, and the mere fact of seeing your name on a page does not make you any more valuable as a writer. You can't fake experience, and the reason for why people give weight to writing credit on their CV is that it comes from real, vetted publishing projects, not some arbitrary pay-to-get-published scheme. There is also no magic publishing procedure that is somehow out of reach of the ordinary mortal to such a degree that you actually have to pay somebody else to do a half-assed job at it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grover" title="Grover"><img alt="Grover" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grover">Grover</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309760/#Comment_309760" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T12:17:37+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 12:17PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Splitting proceeds among all contributors is exactly what it would take to make it fair.

If I were an artist, I'd love this gig, cause it's basically a continuous stream of guaranteed jobs (it's particularly telling that you can't pick your own artist - you need to pay their artist).<br/><br/>If I wanted to do something like this (which I don't - the comments above about how easy it is to publish on your own are very appropriate), I'd set it up as follows:  Writing a piece gets you 4 shares.  Illustrating a piece gets you 4 shares.  Editing a piece gets you 1 share.  Quality checking and collating all the pieces together, and arranging for distribution, and tracking money and so on gets you 2 shares/piece.  Being a bit of a markets geek, I'd probably set something up so that people could buy and sell their shares, if they wanted to, but that's totally optional <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>An alternate, perfectly fair model is:  Publisher pays the writers and artists and editors cash up front, and gets all the profits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darren%20Watts" title="Darren Watts"><img alt="Darren Watts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darren%20Watts">Darren Watts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309764/#Comment_309764" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T12:29:18+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 12:29PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: TylerTI<br/>\nThere have been a few corroborative books lately like<br/>\nhobby games: the 100 best<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure how these get made, but I imagine James Lowder is someone with a good amount of connections, contacts, and few owed favors!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe these books are like talk shows, people agree to be a guest because the status of the show actually means something for the success of their current project and career.<br/>\n .<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a contributor to both "100 Best" books, I can confirm I was paid real cash dollars for my work. dw                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309786/#Comment_309786" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T13:49:12+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  1:49PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Darren Watts</cite>As a contributor to both "100 Best" books, I can confirm I was paid real cash dollars for my work. dw</blockquote>\nthanks for the info Darren! <br/><br/><br/>also click the "format your comment as html" button to make quotes work. it took me forever to figure out why my quotes never worked on this board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309796/#Comment_309796" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T15:04:58+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  3:04PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm cool with paying to get my fan stuff published (like, at Kinko's, or on a website where I pay for hosting so there's no ads or maybe even on lulu if I really get vain, or whatever), it's just fan stuff, though, it's not real work, it's just shit I would do for fun anyway.
