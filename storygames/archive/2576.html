Bounced it off of gamers and nongamers I know, and many agree.<br/><br/>Gamism? The term makes sense. It's a game. You can win encounters. You try to win through tactical prowess. You powergame, but you are by no means means being a munchkin.  You play to win, a very satisfying way of playing.   Exalted is very Gamist in this way.<br/><br/>Simulationsim? The term makes sense. It simulates a fictional world. It tries to have depth and verisimilitude. You try not to stray far from an archtype of something in the world - samurai who follow Bushido, for example.<br/><br/>Narrativism? Doesn't make sense. The above two can easily create a narrative. Countless arguments about the theory stem from the old "But those are stories too!" chestnut.<br/><br/>The problem is not one of definition. Forge "Narrativism" at it's core is about adressing the <b>themes</b> characters bring up. Dogs in the Vineyard is considered Nar because it deals with the themes of faith and moral responsibility, although it is also very Gamist in the strategies you can employ to explore themes.<br/><br/>So, why not call this creative agenda <b>Thematic?</b><br/><br/>Not all stories rely on theme heavily.<br/><br/>But all "narrativist games" are heavily Thematic.<br/><br/>Correct me if I'm wrong...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59048/#Comment_59048" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T12:19:39+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 12:19PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth I've long ago tired to switch over the far more descriptive phases from the later drafts of the models.

But if the word choices interfere with people talking about and improving play through them... as they have when I try to discuss "Narrativism" with friends... it's a problem.  Calling it Thematic is more intuitive, and makes people sit up and go,"Okay, how do these rules address concerns of theme, how are they Thematic?"<br/><br/>One thing I learned from playing Tri-stat dX and playing BESM 3 - which are the same system, with different presentation of the rules - is that presentation counts.  Names count.  BESM is the same, mechanically, as Tri-stat dX, but it's easier to grok.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59054/#Comment_59054" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T12:32:25+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 12:32PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.<br/><br/>I tend to talk about challenge-based or challenge-focused play instead of Gamism, too, because that for me is a good indicator of what it's about (since the word "game" is way broad).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59056/#Comment_59056" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T12:35:47+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 12:35PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliott Belser</cite>But if the word choices interfere with people talking about and improving play through them...</blockquote>\nElliott, you've got a solid point.<br/><br/>However, right now, in the internet dialogue about gaming, there is so much going on that get's in the way with using GNS in any kind of constructive way outside of the Forge's AP forum that I don't really know where to begin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59058/#Comment_59058" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T12:41:43+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 12:41PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strategic (Gam).

When we fail, win, or just describe actions we're constantly narrating...<br/>A: Oh, no, sorry, by Narrativist here we're talking about Something Else, not "narrating".  Here's a bunch of links to some essays to help you understand what we mean by "Narrativist".<br/><br/>Seriously, I see this in almost every thread that discusses GNS. At least 5 or more times a year on RPGnet.  It's not Person B's fault that the word threw them off.<br/><br/>The word Thematic works a lot better. No initial confusion by word usage.

This is a common misconception that should maybe be discussed in another thread.  You don't play Exalted to win.  You play Exalted to do stuff.  Winning just happens.<br/><br/>* Immersion is totally not simulationist -- it's a technique.  I do it when playing Dogs all the time.<br/><br/>* I think Troy's breakdown of Simulationism can be more detailed.  In a recent discussion with some friends, we identified the following as potential aspects of simulationism:<br/><br/>--tropism: playing to embody and live out the tropes of an agreed genre.  Corresponds to "emulation" in Troy's list.<br/>--gravityism: playing to explore the definitions and consequences of the natural laws of the game world as expressed in the rules.  Corresponds to "essentialism" in Troy's list?<br/>--improvisationism: playing to create a three-dimensional character and act as them through a variety of interactions and situations, learning about them thereby.

I contend that "minimal metagame intrusion" is a technique, and not any sort of intrinsic desire.  That's like saying that your diet includes healthy low-fat foods with minimal butter.  Sure, not having butter is good for accomplishing your goals, and sure, maybe you really do just hate butter, but the two are not the same type of goal.  Otherwise, that makes sense, and seems to roughly correspond to "gravityism" as I described it, unless you want to separate out "glorying in consistent setting" and "glorying in consistent natural laws," and I'm not sure you can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59152/#Comment_59152" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T21:52:44+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  9:52PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Point made, Pigeon.<br/><br/>Minimal metagame intrusion is a tool that goes into the "Exploration" box, not part of the "Exploration" box.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59179/#Comment_59179" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T06:32:07+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  6:32AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure that somewhere there's somebody doing what Curly is saying is going on - so let's try to take his admonishment at face value. His other point is correct, however. Nothing wrong with taxonomies as long as you realize what a taxonomy can do, and what it can't.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's interesting is how Ron and most other folks into the theory got off of doing agenda taxonomies a long time ago. In fact that's the primary reason that the Forge Theory Forum got closed. People kept on wanting to rehash GNS when most of the theory had moved on to say, "the general taxonomies aren't as important as the techniques that people are using."<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the attempts at redefining GNS are, therefore, kinda like Neitszche spending his whole life trying to disprove god - they really make the point that people can identify with the idea that there are different sorts of play, even if they think that there's something wrong with the "pigeonholing." The problem is that, as Shreyas points out, the taxonomies rarely apply perfectly as a description, and so they become of little direct use. Arguing what X taxonomy is precisely doesn't end up addressing things like the techniques being used, and how that affects the agenda (and issues of player dissonance in agenda, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying that it isn't interesting or potentially useful to do the taxonomy thing. Just that it's incorrect to say that Forge theory holds that it's an end-all, when said theory moved beyond agenda taxonomies long ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCurly, you have captured precisely why I don't just say "Thematic" but instead, "Play that primarily is intended to produce theme." Narrativism is much easier to write, but has the problems that Andy noted with it (despite, oddly, the root intentionally being chosen as narrative, and not narration). I don't suppose Thematism would stick? Or clarify that theme isn't missing from other modes?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of "ists" I think we get a bit touchy about that. I have no problem with somebody being labeled a Gamist. But what that must mean is that the player prefers gamism - not that he engages in gamism. I like play that could be ascribed to all three of the modes. If I'm engaging in gamism behavior, that doesn't make me a gamist neccessarily. But neither does it preclude the possibility that I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is no different from the notion that a person who promotes Marxism is a Marxist. Just because somebody reads Marx, or even teaches his ideas doesn't make somebody a Marxist - they might also teach free-market capitalism. It's only when a person promotes or adheres only to an ism that you call them an ist.<br/>\n<br/>\nRon is a Narrativist. Oh, not as rabidly as some would paint him, perhaps - he's been known to play other ways. But he's definitely been a proponent for what he originally saw as the unsupported play style, the style he preferred.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm somewhat Narrativist at this point as well. But my play proclivities are more about certain techniques than anything else. Explicit author stance for players, lots of "Director Stance Power" for players, but with strong GM control of events through metaplot (seems contradictory, but ask me about it some time). Non-explicit GM controlled stake-setting, except for cases that are extremely fraught with potential trouble. Etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd really that's just about my HQ game. In InSpectres, because of the rules, I use a different set of rules. I'm only a narrativist in that I either play games that support narrativism well, or slant less clear-cut games towards narrativism with technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own Beeg Horseshoe 2 model, I'm a medium fecundity (you should see Chris Weeks get all twisted in knots when I bring out any of the world canon), theme producing promoter. I don't think that there's anything wrong with stating your proclivities, as long as you keep an open mind about styles of play. I've also played some strictly gamism D&amp;D; in the past year. So...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to go off on such a tangent, but I hope I've given some perspective to the conversation.
