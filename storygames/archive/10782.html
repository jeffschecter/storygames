Do you do this? If so, how do you do this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread is for techniques, whether used in game design or in the GMing of any particular game, of how the broader setting gets more teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Empire of Dust does something like this by allowing player-characters to have some sort of link to the major NPCs in the setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own game, Change, which is about creating and changing fictional cultures through play (yay vested interest in topic!), does something similar by having the common space the players' different cultures inhabit directly influence said cultures. Basically, there Threats - dangerous things - and Resources - useful things - in the game, each has a name and a certain rating which changes through play. At the end of each turn, a roll is made for both threats and resources, and if the roll is such that the threat or resource increases, all player cultures at the table get a new trait (bad for threats, good for resources) that signifies how the change affected them, directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also common Powers and Limitations (again, name + rating, though the mechanics differ from threats/resources) that work by making certain actions easier or more difficult. This doesn't have the straightforward effect of a new trait, but it does drive gameplay towards or from certain themes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after a period of play cultures in a world that starts as:<br/>\n<br/>\nThreat: Outlanders 7<br/>\nResource: Offworld spices 5<br/>\nPower: Council of Mages 4<br/>\nLimitation: No direct warfare 8<br/>\n<br/>\nwill change in ways that'll show how exactly they reacted and interacted with these outlanders, spices, the council of mages, and how they went about trying to live with or subvert the limitation of no warfare.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any time, it's always the player's choice on what kind of change exactly he makes to his culture, but he does have to make them, and they do have to have a certain colour.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, these things are not directly applicable to character based games, but there's little effort in porting them... Have a straightforward requirement of players that belong to a certain group or place to have a trait that shows their relationship to them... Or give bonuses to rolls when they are in certain places. Looking for information is easier in the ancient library-city, getting rare stuff - in the trading hub of the seven seas, looting - in the war-torn villages between two kingdoms. Stuff like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what're your techniques?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239242/#Comment_239242" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-27T00:14:42+00:00" title="October 27, 2009 12:14AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Currently: notes, sketches, maps and, since we're playing Apocalypse World, Fronts. Fronts are a series of linked threats with an overall agenda, cast and time-line; and sometimes a special mechanical effect/rule. Not really that complicated but I've found that the one's with a clear agenda, and following Vincent's advice in the playtest, simple desires are the most interesting, useful and easily portrayed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, less is more when it comes to settings and characters. Name, wants, one or two details. Specificity is important too. I find that with just a handful of words my and my player's minds interpret and fill in the gaps. Locations serve more as a context for various scenes and are there as implicit resources for the narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_239245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239245/#Comment_239245" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-27T02:15:55+00:00" title="October 27, 2009  2:15AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>So, after a period of play cultures in a world that starts as:<br><br>Threat: Outlanders 7<br>Resource: Offworld spices 5<br>Power: Council of Mages 4<br>Limitation: No direct warfare 8<br><br>will change in ways that'll show how exactly they reacted and interacted with these outlanders, spices, the council of mages, and how they went about trying to live with or subvert the limitation of no warfare.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>How does the change pronounce itself in the overview? Will there be further notes, like this; <i>Threat: Outlanders 8, Invaded Moria +1</i><br><br>In my game <i>Muu </i>the setting is a kind of character through the language used to describe it; simple, poetic and vague. The conscious us of language in the game makes the absurdly simple setting (trees, stones, grass and a pond) into a magical land in commune with the muu's (the player characters).<br><br>In my game <i>Chorus </i>the setting has similar mystical qualities, but this is a highly detailed fantasy-setting with the characters being people like us. They live in a communal covenant with The Land, and pray for it to give them food and shelter. The Land will provide the character with an apple-tree if he ask for it (it will grow from the earth, spring into bloom and bear fruit before his very eyes). It makes for a magic setting with a kind of spiritual bond between land and people. The characers are talking to The Land all the time. The Land is their friend, as long as they keep the covenant.<br><br>In my game Fabula, another fantasy-game, the nobles are invested with a special connection to the shires they govern. In some nobles this bond will develop into free and mighty spirits, grand NPC-figures that expresses the power of the people, the land or the shadows of their shire. And these figures are connected to the noble, his supporters or advisers, or (in some cases) the most fierce figure of opposition in the shire.<br><br>I find such use of the setting in fantasy to be very interesting. It is a leap of faith, of course, but done right it opens the gameplay to great oportunities. Characters invested with such bonds to the land or the people, tend to be very protective of their "friend", and that is a stance that may be exploited to create conflicts of great importance to them. ;-)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239251/#Comment_239251" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-27T04:50:33+00:00" title="October 27, 2009  4:50AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2009 10:54AM by DWeird.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the focus of the game isn't really the common world as represented by the those attributes... It's about player-controlled cultures that are essentially lists of traits. A culture gets new traits by facing self-appointed challenges, or being influenced by other cultures... But they also get new traits from the common world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Threats/Resources/Powers/Limitations go up and down in their rating (debating having extra colour added to them as they change), and every time they do, the cultures living in the world get new traits (i.e., "Invaded by Outlanders", "Trade routes" "Sorceror Lineage" and etc.) that reflect what actually happened there. Also, every time a particular thing reaches a certain high or low point, something horrible or something excellent happens to all cultures involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe changes of the world are tracked directly as raw numbers + names, and indirectly as the traits they have given the cultures that inhabit said world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you tell me more about Fabula's mechanics that govern the noble-shrine connection?

In my view they need to have other (strange) motivations, and grand powers, and still be negotiable for the PC's in some way, and easy to portray. so I am thinking of writing simple player advice to hand out when players take control over them. Something like this:<br><br><i><b>Spirit of the people</b><br>- Stand up when you play the spirit; it is GRAND!<br>- Use GRAND gestures and a GRAND voice, whatever you say.<br>- Be humble towards any and all wishes by your bonded soul, and follow its command.<br>- Act for the people (not any individual) of the fief in all things, bar the wishes of your bonded soul.<br>- Nothing is of greater worth than the people, not you, nor any other individual. <br>- Your bonded soul may force you to disregard the people, to your pain and sorrow.<br>- Your feelings are GRAND, and should express themselves in GRAND consequenses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></i><br><br>(thinking aloud here now)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
