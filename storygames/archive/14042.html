Maybe do some little seminars, a GM's conference, that sort of thing; see what the people in your community already know about how to introduce people who have never played before to gaming, good games for beginners, and so on...the usual "how do I find people to play with?" stuff, so that people who have friends/family/co-workers who might be interested in gaming can bring 'em into their home games.<br/><br/>I mean, I suppose it would be nice if everyone in the world actually enjoyed spending a full day in a room with 150+ strangers, but that's hardly realistic.  But if some portion of the 150+ attendees each go out and find a couple of people who weren't at the event to play with, that's a serious win for your gaming community, even if none of those new people ever show up at Recess in NYC.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318003/#Comment_318003" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-28T15:01:40+00:00" title="March 28, 2011  3:01PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>OK, so, it looks like there are a number of issues involved here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People need a certain amount of geographic proximity.</li>\n<li>People need a certain amount of temporal overlap.</li>\n<li>People need a certain amount of interest in the same games, and game-play styles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crucially, you are trying to get people who match in these three ways to meet at significantly greater-than-chance.

The only bit of suggestion I have is making really targeted events\u2014be they a certain game, or a panel on a certain thing, or whatever, and having a sign-up for people who want to meet people through it, that asks for time and place. That way, you can assume people have self-selected into the third point, and you can relatively easily sort based on time and space.

Kind of like one of those info directories for professional organization meetings.  <br/><br/>Hold a short mixer during the con.  Figure out a set of times, and a set of areas.  Put up posters with the times around the edge of the space.  People go to their preferred type.  Mix.  Then half-way turn the posters over to show the the areas.  People go to their areas.  Mix.  (I don't think game types would work well for this.)  The times/areas could have overlapping categories.  "Weekends, weekdays, 9-5, biweekly."  "Burrough 1, burrough 2, on the X line, near blah-di-blah campus."<br/><br/>Treasure hunt!  Everybody writes down three times, areas and games they want to play.  During the course of the con they have to find 3 or 4 or whatever people who match.  No fair writing down names of people you already know well.  No more than one name within when/where/what, but bonus points for finding one person who's a match for more than one of when/where/what.  The person who gets the most points wins a year of gaming!<br/><br/>At the start of the con, make everyone construct a hat representing their preferred gaming style, location and time.

Everybody writes down three times, areas and games they want to play.  During the course of the con they have to find 3 or 4 or whatever people who match.  No fair writing down names of people you already know well.  No more than one name within when/where/what, but bonus points for finding one person who's a match for more than one of when/where/what.  The person who gets the most points wins a year of gaming!</blockquote>\n...or even an actual prize, some free gaming books or a gift certificate or a toaster or something.  This is a damn good idea, I'm sure I've read success stories about similar "scavenger hunt" contests at other conventions, where doing things like playing a game you've never played before and running a game and wearing an appropriate costume for a game could earn people some kind of swag.  I mean, the one thing you can count on from everyone at an all-day gaming convention is that <i>they enjoy playing games</i>, so making fun community-forming activities into a game seems like a slam dunk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
