It had probably just been crawling around looking for shade when it ran into the banthas.  they were having a fine time with it, and its crawling days were over.  The cow had its head underfoot, and the bull had its tail.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Command: You banthas move along," HK-47 said, jabbing the cow.  "Suggestion: Move down into the canyon if you want to crush womp rats."  It was the loading ramp he begrudged them, not the womp rat.  Banthas on the loading ramp just made things hotter, and things were already hot enough.  He stepped out onto the sand and walked around to the armory to get his blaster.  The suns were still high, but HK-47 had a keen photoreceptor for sun, and to his photoreceptors the long light from the west had taken on an encouraging slant.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nNot really aiming for anything, just thought I'd share an image that came to mind.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
