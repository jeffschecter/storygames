After each session ask, 'How could this have been part of something more complicated?'"</b><br/><br/>I realize I am terrible at this.  Please help me brainstorm what types of questions I might ask to become better.<br/><br/>For example, I can think of...<br/><br/>1. Who else benefited from the main bad guy's plans?  How did they benefit?  How has this adventure been a part of their recent or future activities or plans?<br/><br/>What are other lines of thought to pursue?

Then try random combinations (draw 2-3 items randomly from the deck, randomize off the list, etc). Only give up if you really really really can't make a connection.<br/><br/>Yes it's a lot of work to list all the "stuff" in the campaign. But think of it as a workshopping technique toward getting better at making the connections with less work in the future.<br/><br/>And you may find that the act of documenting your campaign is really the biggest and most important step anyway. Just having a record of what all the stuff is that you can refer to may be the most important part of connecting things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS" title="DavidVS"><img alt="DavidVS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/nMT00GFQS5U2U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">DavidVS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383905/#Comment_383905" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T14:05:54+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  2:05PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good tips.  Thanks!<br/><br/>While on a walk yesterday my wife helped me come up with two more ideas...<br/><br/>(a) Include in each adventure an item or bit of information that is purposefully a loose end, even if you have no idea yet how it might fit with anything else.<br/><br/>(b) Ponder where unusual equipment came from.  (Example: The villain had a chair with straps that turned corpses into zombies.  Dead-end ideas were that he made it himself or it was a gift from his evil patron deity.  Loose-end ideas are that he brought it to his lair from the creepy ruins of a castle a few days away, or lots of local villains have been scrounging stuff from the trophy room of a powerful team of heroes who were finally killed.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
