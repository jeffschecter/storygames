We put up posters and got on the store's online calendar.  Slowly, because we were the only event that was always "open" to whoever showed up, other people trickled in.  Some became regular attendees, some came occasionally, lots of people came once or twice but then never came back.  However, it was crucial in the beginning that, no matter what, at least 4 people were there every week, enough to run <i>something</i>.  Without that, it would have likely collapsed early on. Now... Dev, Nathan, and myself can all be gone... for weeks on end sometimes! And yet something is generally happening under the name SGBoston every Wed night.  But that's after almost two years of open Wed night events every week.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the local RPG Meetup group has kinda forcibly attached itself to SGBoston of late.  They've added our meetings to their calendar and named me the official "SGBoston meetup host" or something.  I get about 6 emails a week regarding people from their group who are or are not coming to SGBoston meetings... and most of these people I've never even seen before!  So honestly, if you can join a group that already exists, even one full of D&amp;D grognards, and post your regular meetings and what you're thinking about playing, it might help you gradually build an audience without having to fork over the money yourself.<br/><br/>So, critical things:<br/><br/>- post ads at your local game store, on their calendar, on their website, on local game mailing lists<br/>- prep games that can work as one-shots, with no extended commitment needed<br/>- maybe start with "crossover" games, like the "alt. dungeon" stuff or Agon or 3:16 or something else violent and relatively straightforward<br/>- pre-gen some characters, unless it's PTA and that's half the point; open game events are like con games, with all the traits and potential problems<br/>- be there every week and make sure you bring enough people to run _something_; if more people come and you can run more than one game, great<br/>- try to get other folks to bring games to run as early as possible, to keep the burden from always being on you; we found that PTA is great for this                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179652/#Comment_179652" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T09:15:09+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  9:15AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, between posting in RPGNet Meetups, Indie-RPGs Conventions forum, and here I've found some awesome folks in the area.

SGBoston has tried a variety of formats, but none of them have been as successful as "weekly open gaming, Wed 7pm, <a href="http://www.pandemoniumbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">Pandemonium Books</a>," which was our original slot.<br/><br/><b>Things That Are Good About This Slot</b><br/>- easy to remember<br/>- don't have to figure out if it's an "on" week or an "off" week<br/>- central, unchanging location<br/>- Pandemonium is glad to have us, even though we don't necessarily generate consistent sales<br/>- Pandemonium carries some indie games<br/>- Pandemonium has enough space for us, we even ran the box-larp <i>Long Live the King</i><br/><br/><b>Things That Are Bad About This Slot</b><br/>- some people can't make Weds or any weekday night<br/>- trying to run something every week is exhausting and, especially early on, only a few people were running things<br/>- open gaming is sometimes less functional or fun than invite only, just because you have less control over who you're playing with<br/>- sometimes you're playing with folks new to "alt. roleplaying" or new to gaming in general, which makes for slower starts<br/>- it's hard to run short arcs or multi-session play when attendance varies from week to week<br/>- sometimes people bring games to playtest but then nobody there is really excited about playing them, which kills their excitement<br/>- Pandemonium's game section is often haphazardly run; Your Move Games (which is a bad space for roleplaying) has a better indie selection<br/>- Wed is Open Board Games night, so we have to compete with that<br/>- neon lighting and noise makes it harder to run games that require building a mood or better acting chops<br/><br/>For a while, we tried running "official SGBoston side-project games" (or whatever) in people's homes, as a viable alternative solving some of the bad things about our Pandemonium slot.  However, these eventually just became unrelated "alongside games" (or whatever) and are only connected to SGBoston by involving some of the same people.  For example, right now Eric's running an D&amp;D 3.5 game featuring mostly SGBoston people and I'm doing the likewise with Bliss Stage.  Also, I know that Eben, Dev, and Nathan additionally play games with other crews that have never been to a SGBoston game night.<br/><br/>There are other roleplaying crews in Boston that I know of, but I haven't been able to get them to participate in SGBoston, for whatever reasons, despite having tried a bunch of different times.  It seems like you can't throw a shopping cart in this city without hitting 2d6 roleplayers.  It's nuts.  Almost all the housemates I've met on Craigslist play dork games.  But they all run in their own fairly closed roleplaying circles and don't cross-pollinate so much.  Even the local conventions, like Harvard's Vericon (which always used to be the same week as Dreamation) are very much in-crowd kinds of scenes.  Dev (who's a Harvard alum) led several of us around Vericon last year, but we had very few meaningful interactions with the folks there.  And because that's the norm, I guess, different gaggles of dorks don't seem to want to integrate.  Honestly, there were similar things going on in the Raleigh-Durham area when I was there, even though, like, Clinton, Jason Morningstar, Andy, and Rafael "Dread" Chandler all live in the same area, so it may just be one of the products of how roleplaying communities have historically developed.  The internet is changing things and opening things up, for sure, but it's happening slowly.<br/><br/>Calgary is definitely big enough that you could make something like this work.  I mean, what else are people going to do in the winter, anyway, right?  Plus, you should totally try to make it down to the next GoPlayNW in Seattle.  It's a bit of a trek for you, but it's within spitting distance of Vancouver if you can get transport there and I know some cool cats involved in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179674/#Comment_179674" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T10:53:18+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 10:53AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think personal satisfaction has killed any outreach efforts in the RDU local scene.

There is some of that insular stuff going on as well (I feel a little awkward at local Game Days, where a zillion people know each other and I ... don't) but it isn't too bad.  Our regional convention is friendly and I always game with strangers there who later become friends. That seems to be where the cross-pollination is happening here in the dirty south.

I started collecting posters at the Forge who identified that they lived in MN.  When it got close to move time, I started a Yahoo group sent the people whom I'd collected PMs and some of them responded and joined.  Over time, other people saw us mentioned here and there and without much active recruiting, I think we have like 18-20 people subscribed now and I think nine of them have ever come to one of our get-togethers and there is really a core five of us who meet regularly.  But we only meet every 2-3 weeks and schedule our games rather than having an open-game thing.  I'd love to do more, but family, job, etc....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179685/#Comment_179685" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T11:46:27+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 11:46AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would suggest not limiting yourself to what you see as "indie/story", and try to get a meetup going with all sorts of games: D&amp;D scenarios, boardgames, cardgames, etc., and recruit selfishly from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179687/#Comment_179687" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T11:53:03+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 11:53AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, at least in a few of the "general gaming" social groups I've interacted with over the years, the identity politics are fierce enough that the group has fragmented over them repeatedly. The GURPs people don't get along with the D&amp;D people who don't get along with the White Wolf people, and the D&amp;D people are balkanized over edition wars dating back to whose table they preferred in 1975... but they can usually all agree that those weirdo games are the devil.

After 2-3 years, our bi-weekly Friday night gaming guild became so successful in introducing new games and new people to each other that now many of these people have games 1-3 times a week! With different groups! Throw in people getting older, married, having kids, we lose our base. Yet I know there are 100s of gamers here who aren't gaming. The problem is getting hungry, smart, and dedicated organizers to be in charge to lead the next wave.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179689/#Comment_179689" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T11:53:10+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 11:53AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can also make gamers out of perfectly ordinary, smart, fun-loving people, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179691/#Comment_179691" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T11:54:10+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 11:54AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's what's usually worked best for me, yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179692/#Comment_179692" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T11:54:11+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 11:54AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>JD, at least in a few of the "general gaming" social groups I've interacted with over the years, the identity politics are fierce enough that the group has fragmented over them repeatedly.</blockquote>\nWeird, ours is all about the cross-pollination.

Huh.</blockquote>In my experience? To cherry-pick a few players for your own private group and vanish, never to be seen again. Or because you actively enjoy being a dick about other people's gaming.<br/><br/>Seriously - the dynamic that seems to be most common is to treat the group as no more than a recruiting ground - I've very rarely seen any lasting commitment to open play and trying new things. Even one of the local gaming cons is pretty solidly caught up in this dynamic - a good 1/3 of the scheduled games in any given year will feature the same people from year to year, and it's quite rare to see more than a handful of "new hotness" tables.<br/><br/>But I think I risk a derail. Other communities' mileage may vary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179701/#Comment_179701" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T13:58:38+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  1:58PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I would suggest not limiting yourself to what you see as "indie/story", and try to get a meetup going with all sorts of games: D&amp;D scenarios, boardgames, cardgames, etc., and recruit selfishly from there.</blockquote>\nThis is essentially what we're trying to do with <a href="http://www.goplaypeoria.com" rel="nofollow">Go Play Peoria</a>.
