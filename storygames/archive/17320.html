When we use games to create story, we are supporting a mode of thought (storytelling) that humans are already, naturally talented at (and to such a ridiculous extent that it even overwhelms basic logic and rationality).<br/><br/>Is there a human predisposition to make games?  If there is, then that's what you want to tap into.

Stuff like point economies, mechanics to create tension or to reinforce tension - those kind of things. Rather than the ability to adapt a system to a campaign system, I'm thinking more of a way to design mechanics that are tailor made for and that would make a home campaign setting shine.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392596/#Comment_392596" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T23:14:44+00:00" title="October  6, 2012 11:14PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, flippancy aside (sorry, sometimes I just do that, and Eero expertly teased out with much clearer language than I could what I meant by those two mysterious words)--<br/><br/>I think you can totally do this. Anything is theoretically possible, especially if no one's done it yet. Don't think <i>possible</i>, think <i>how</i>. I mean, Jackson Tegu made a game (<a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/passerine/temper/" rel="nofollow">Temper</a>) that helps you deal with your anger. I'm making a game that helps you sit down and do your creative work.<br/><br/>Game design is just experience design, right? Making incentives &amp; cycles that people buy into so they act in the way you want them to act. So make a game that helps them see the world through the lens of game design, and gives them practical ways to apply it. That's nothing like a comprehensive answer, but that may be a useful thought to you.<br/><br/>Also, see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Challenges-Game-Designers-Brenda-Brathwaite/dp/158450580X/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349590435&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=brenda+garno+brathwaite" rel="nofollow">Challenges For Game Designers</a>, a book I have but have yet to read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392598/#Comment_392598" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T23:37:10+00:00" title="October  6, 2012 11:37PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nomic largely works like this, or can.

There are many games that have "holes" in them where they ask someone to do a little bit of design work. Not just things like GURPS, but the "rulings not rules" part of old school games or the "custom moves" part of Apocalypse World. In a game that was focused on teaching, though, I think there would be a bit more structure to those sections, a method for generating new rules content rather than leaving it more open-ended.<br/><br/>Seems like such a game would be better, though, if it focused on teaching a particular style or type of design work. Trying to leave it open ended, so it taught you how to design whatever game you wanted, would probably involve it being so vague that it's basically an outline of the process but doesn't really give you much specific help. Whereas, if it was going to teach you something specific -- like how to design a good D&amp;D monster, or how to write a Fiasco playset, or how to set up a relationship map -- it could be much more educational.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392703/#Comment_392703" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T08:57:28+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  8:57AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kyle,<br/>  There was a Game Chef game called perfect laws that might fit the bill.

I've designed all types in my examples but the last one.<br/><br/>If you at least narrowed it down to a few things that the system could handle, it would be much easier. Like having a structure as follows (for a game that simulates what happens to the PCs):<br/><br/>1. Write down a few design goals. What do you want your game to be about?<br/>2. Decide on a resolution for your system.<br/>3. When you add stuff to your system, you must include something that you have already written about your system.<br/><br/>It's a poor example, but what I wanted to show is how you can <i>introduce ideas through structures</i>, like that it's good to have design goals and that you should always try to tie different subsystems together in some way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392724/#Comment_392724" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T11:44:51+00:00" title="October  8, 2012 11:44AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2012 11:45AM by mease19.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about a game that has cards with mechanics on them.

Is the purpose of the game to have it's players create a game? If so, then nomic, 1000 cards and similar games already fill that niche, though i reckon there is still room for more.<br/><br/>Then again, wouldn't it be more of a learning experience if the game would introduce several concepts which are crucial with game design. In the process of the game they would be demostrated to the players along with why are they important, what do they achieve, what happens if you neglect them etc.<br/><br/>The former approach will produce a game. The latter would go closer to educating a designer, which I think is the goal stated in the OP. So the key to the game is what concepts is it to demonstrate and how to do it effectively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392752/#Comment_392752" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T14:01:52+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  2:01PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What it was more like a structured "playstorming" method?
