Also!  I don't own SotC and am not an expert, but what you described above is something I can do after a practice round.  That's important.  <br/><br/>And I agree that aiming for ten minutes is a good idea - if you aim for fifteen it will last twenty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85266/#Comment_85266" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T07:30:56+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  7:30AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to reuse my demo from last year, it worked really well.

I actually ran and found my friends and dragged them over so I could go through the demo again with them. The NPC cards that let me keep track of which characters were in a scene and allied with which player, the short comic that explained the setting so I could read it while the other players were getting 1-on-1 time with Jason, and, of course, the quality of the game itself.<br/><br/>Bar-none, though, the most important thing for me was the enthusiasm of the person running the demo. Since story games tend to go into genres that are less standard than Fantasy/Horror/Sci-Fi, it really helps to have the demoer being as excited they wish I was about the game. It's like a subliminal way of answering the "why should I care?" question. I'm thinking specifically of the demos I played for Contenders, Carry, and Best Friends last year.<br/><br/>You can best be sure I'll be at GenCon again this year looking for more demos that'll knock my socks off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85342/#Comment_85342" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T10:29:58+00:00" title="August  3, 2007 10:29AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have a nice Classroom Deathmatch demo that almost always leaves 10-20 characters dead in 15 minutes.

Those who played the one from GC last year will remember that it falls into basically two conflicts between two characters each. That's good in that it allows people to watch and see different parts of the overall mechanics in action. What I'm striving for now is a situation where everyone is taking part at once. <br/><br/>My mind, though, is a blank when it comes to a really cool moment for the demo to take place in. My thoughts were:<br/><br/>4 characters, all with opposing Hidden Agendas<br/>They have just killed the adversary<br/>They are in a room surrounded by valuable esoteric technology (was thinking of an abandoned floor mill/grain silo on the border of the British and Soviet zones of Berlin)<br/>Soviet MGB troops are heading up the stairs on one side of the building<br/>British infantry are heading up stairs on the other side<br/>Go!<br/><br/>However, it just doesn't seem to do it for me. <br/><br/>The demo last years worked, despite the split in conflicts. It ran to time, it was fast paced, demonstrated all the key aspects of the mechanics and gave a flavour of the game. Anyone who played it have any further feedback on improvements that could be made?<br/><br/>I'll agree that the Roach demo was fun: it captured the game and made me want to buy it. As a buyer, I want a demo to be enthusiastic, to take place in a prototypical moment of that game and I certainly don't want it to last longer than 15 minutes when that's what it's been advertised as. There were demo that went on way longer than this and if I wasn't personally interested after the first five minutes, then it felt like it was really dragging. <br/><br/>So, I think the things I value most are concision and clarity. Keep it short and keep it to the important basics.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85394/#Comment_85394" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T12:52:19+00:00" title="August  3, 2007 12:52PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a tough one, Malcolm - handling four people who are all interacting eats up the minutes.

I've played a fair number of demos, but they've almost never influenced either my opinion of the game, or my likelihood to buy it. Two exceptions: the demo of the Matrix games sold me. And I was on the fence about Shock:, but bought it because of the demo [and it turns out i wish i'd read the book instead of done the demo, because then i'd've known the game wasn't all there, and be buying the new edition, instead of having the original, but that's a separate issue]. Unfortunately, i've most often used demos after i've already bought and read the game, and couldn't figure it out--a use that there should never be a need for. But, again, that's sort of a tangent.<br/><br/>See, for me, the fact that, as several have observed, you can't cram all of the coolness of most RPGs into 15min means that a demo really isn't satisfactory. There are two ways that the "incomplete" demo falls short. From the consumer's/player's perspective, it's not satisfactory, because while it may give me a couple cool mechanical hooks, it won't give me an appreciation for the game as a whole. From the producer's perspective, it's not satisfactory because what you think is the cool awesome in your game may not be what i think is the cool awesome, so you miss a sale because you don't even tell me about this awesome bit of your game, because you don't have room for it in the demo.<br/><br/>However, there are very few RPGs that are so complex that all the cool bits can't be *explained* in 15min. Heck, most of them can be explained in 5min. Now, i realize that for some players, this just isn't the same as actually playing a bit of a game. But i can speak with authority for myself: even if they covered the same exact content, in most cases describing the mechanics to me is going to be *more* effective than showing them to me in play. IOW, i'm almost the diametric opposite of Gregor Hutton and Caesar_X: i want it all, not just the highpoints; and i'd rather have it explained, than shown. And i've met other people like myself, who're pretty much scared away from the Forge booth by the aggressive demo atmosphere. <br/><br/>Luckily, there's a really easy solution that i'd like to encourage: refine your ability to explain/describe your game clearly and concisely, as well as your ability to demo it effectively. And then give the potential customer all three options for discovering whether the game is for them: a short demo, a shorter (but presumably more comprehensive) description, or a chance to browse the book. In the past, my experience at the Forge booth has frequently been that the game creator can't concisely explain their game, leaving me frustrated or forced to just read the book and  figure it out for myself. Or perhaps they can, but don't even try, instead responding to "tell me about your game" with "it doesn't really come across in the explaining--let me show you with a quick demo". Please don't do that--if i want a demo, i'll ask for one; if i ask for an explanation, it's because i want an explanation. Some people learn better from the concrete experience of play; some learn better from the abstracted description of play--it's a learning style thing, and transcends the medium or the topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86441/#Comment_86441" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T06:26:10+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  6:26AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 6:28AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I just put up my first crack at a Grey Ranks demo <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/grey_ranks/demo/2007_grey_ranks_demo_04.pdf" rel="nofollow">here.</a>  I'm trying it out this week to see if it can fit in fifteen minutes - there's a lot of stuff in there, but I think going through a complete mechanical iteration gives you a nice feel for the game.

That's exactly what i *don't* want in a demo (as a customer). I don't want a teaser/trailer. I want the cliffnotes. *Do* give away the whole thing. Please! I don't expect full depth (unless the game is simple enough to teach in 15min, which a few are), but i do want full breadth. <br/><br/>And, to add some positive here: i think your movie-trailer analogy is an excellent one for what most people have been doing. It's a great way to summarize the goal/structure.<br/><br/>Though i generally avoid movie trailers, too. I never know if they're going to spoil the movie, which is why i avoid them. But even when they don't, they don't tell me what i want/need to know to decide if i want to see the movie. Generally speaking, ditto for game demos of the sort described.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87499/#Comment_87499" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T09:09:59+00:00" title="August 11, 2007  9:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what you want, woodelf, is not what can be delivered easily within the time constraints.<br/><br/>Wanting what you'd want, I'd head over to Games on Demand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87514/#Comment_87514" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T10:23:52+00:00" title="August 11, 2007 10:23AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Fred.

If i wanted that, i'd read the real book--er, just play the game. Maybe you're right, and at least for the more-complex games (like SotC), it can't be done in 15min. But i've *had* demos of games that covered the whole game in 15min or so, but just an overview, not in depth. So i'm pretty sure what i'm asking for isn't impossible, it's just very different from the usual demo mentality that i've seen at the Forge booth. See, i don't need to experience the awesome bits in their full awesomeness to identify them--but i do need to be aware of their existence. So focusing on one aspect of a game to full depth is overkill, and the breadth that is consequently missing, i miss.<br/><br/>And, yeah, i'm gonna be taking atvantage of Games on Demand. But specifically for a couple of games that i've already read, and played, and they fell flat, so i want to figure out if it's me, or the game (that is, is it that we did somethin wrong, or the game just isn't for me, despite looking like exactly my cuppa on paper).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'm with Fred.

If i wanted that, i'd read the real book--er, just play the game. Maybe you're right, and at least for the more-complex games (like SotC), it can't be done in 15min. But i've *had* demos of games that covered the whole game in 15min or so, but just an overview, not in depth. So i'm pretty sure what i'm asking for isn't impossible, it's just very different from the usual demo mentality that i've seen at the Forge booth. See, i don't need to experience the awesome bits in their full awesomeness to identify them--but i do need to be aware of their existence. So focusing on one aspect of a game to full depth is overkill, and the breadth that is consequently missing, i miss.<br/></blockquote>\nI think you have a different idea of what's in a "trailer demo" than I do, and that's probably part of the view-skew here.  I suspect we actually sit a lot closer to one another in terms of what we think needs to be in a demo.  Frex, the SOTC demo I did *does* touch on most of the game, but (trailer mentality:) it <i>emphasizes</i> specific things in depth.  So, I'd say my goal with a demo is to aggressively breeze through all the points of the system (3-5 minutes), then focus on some Cool Shit (5-8 minutes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89176/#Comment_89176" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T12:33:24+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 12:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2007 12:35PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/grey_ranks/demo/grey_ranks_demo_final.pdf" rel="nofollow">my finalized demo</a>, pretty much word for word what I was doing on Sunday afternoon.

I could not help but feel like the demoes were geared towards people who get Story Games and may have talked over the heads of some people who are not so familiar with them.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a strict policy of demo-ing games before buying them, so demos are a big deal to me.  Usually I demo games I'm already excited about, but at Gencon this year I was unsold on several games I was almost sure I was going to buy by confusing or boring demos.  A good demo (to me) is a snippet of play which does three things: it shows off what's cool about the game, it lets the players do something cool (or otherwise feel like they're having fun), and it gives me some idea of what it might be like to GM the game.  Some demos that sold me were a Dogs demo which was basically just a couple of conflicts resulting from the "your nephew has been stealing from your brother to hire the shopkeeper's prostitute wife" situation from the book.  The dictionary of mu demo was a single scene with each player, followed by an explanation of how the two plotlines would connect, was another winner.  The most successful demo I've played in was of Inspectres.  I was never that interested in Inspectres, and my friends and I only went to the booth to get our indie passports stamped.  Somehow I found myself demoing the game (basically a very short adventure with pregens, the plot apparently cooked up on the spot); it was so much fun I walked out with a copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kind of demo I hate has no play and is basically a brief lecture about the game and how it works.  Although well-written rules are a pleasure to play with, I still find them a chore to read.  Getting lectured about the game is like a chore with no payoff, and even if it sounds fun, I still have no idea what playing is actually like, not even the snippet from a play demo.  A lecture 'demo' at this year's gencon actually unsold me from a game I was almost sure I was going to buy.  Another thing I really hate in demos is when the GM shuffles dice back and forth, telling me to roll this or that and sort of half-explaining why, leading to a sort of dice vertigo when I completely give up on trying to follow what the rules are like.  If this happens, the game is a much harder sell, because I can only judge it on non-rules aspects and remain suspicious.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, in games with simple, clever chargen, a stripped down chargen session can really add a lot to a demo - this was done to great effect in the Shock and 1001 Nights demos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3799/gen-con-demos" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3799/gen-con-demos" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3799/gen-con-demos/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3799%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3799%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
