I ran the "Deliver the Mail" scenario included in the book.<br/><br/>Getting ready a couple of hours before, I was a bit nervous, actually. I had read the book enough to grok the basics, but I didn't have a solid grasp of most of the interrelated elements of the character. I knew how traits, beliefs, skills, fate/persona points, and the Players' Turn worked in and of themselves, but they all relate to each other in interesting little ways, and I didn't have all of that in my head. So imagine my relief when I go to print out the character sheets and find that all of those little relationships are right there, next to the widgets they affect! The sheet really is an awesome tool for the game, allowing you to keep only the basics in your head at one time, while still having most of the intricacies right at hand. I actually had the players copy their character information from the pregen sheet onto a real character sheet as part of explaining things.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to delivering the mail. After getting smacked around by the spring weather (ob 6? Good luck with that!) via a collapsing mud embankment, the mice ended up at the stump with the raven. It was pretty fun playing the inscrutable raven, cocking my head to the side and squawking. Peter as Dain tried to talk to it with Loremouse, but didn't make the roll. Here I made a bit of a mistake. I should have either made Dain Angry at the bird but still started a conversation or dropped a twist that the bird ignored the talking and made a grab for the mailbag. Instead I just made Dain Angry and went straight to the mailbag conflict.<br/><br/>And what a conflict! That raven was rolling 8 dice for everything! Even three mice working together require a lot of luck and careful scripting to overcome that. Except... I made the mistake of having the raven start by engaging the mice on the ground. A Raven's Nature includes "Scavenger, Acrobat, Trickster, and Flying". Digging with his beak to root out the mice trying to hide in a shaded snow drift doesn't really jive with any of those. Playing it cagey with bows and spears (rendering attack vs. attack a Versus test, instead of independent), the mice kept their losses low, and a couple of lucky rolls started taxing the raven's nature. Suddenly the mice were on even ground!<br/><br/>I floundered for an exchange or two, before deciding on a desperate strategy: Go all the way! The raven, confused as well, continued to act un-ravenlike, in hopes of depleting his nature before he ran out of disposition*. It was quite a pounding, but his nature hit 0 right when his disposition was down to 1. Resetting to 7, though, I had the advantage, even if it would only take one lucky roll to end it...<br/><br/>...Well, one lucky roll or one persona point. The raven flew up high in Defense, trying to rebuild his disposition a bit without risking his nature, but Robin the tenderpaw would have none of it. He raced up a tree and made a flying leap to grab the mail bag, simultaneously ending the conflict and fulfilling his goal of "I will prove to Quentin that I am a worthy tenderpaw on this mission"! (Oh, and spraining his ankle on landing, as the main point of compromise).<br/><br/>The players then had a nice quiet Player Turn at Gilpledge. Peter had Dain stew in the corner over his ale to bleed off his anger, and Robin got his foot sewn up while regaling Gilpledge's little ones with their adventures and his flying leap. We marked up our assorted checks for advancement and called it a night.<br/><br/><br/>And back in the wilderness? Well, that raven depleted his nature, which gives him an un-ravenlike trait. So there's a raven out there who is now deathly afraid of mice.<br/><br/>*I had missed the rule on page 233 that says you can deplete your nature at any time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190554/#Comment_190554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T11:33:16+00:00" title="January 29, 2009 11:33AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Albert, I might be running this mission tonight, so I'm especially interested.  Would you say that the raven acted particular un-raven-like because you were playing it as if the raven was basically a wandering monster who keeps attacking the PCs until they beat it?  How would the fight have played out, you think, if the raven had snatched the bag of mail and immediately tried to fly away?  Would it have been less exciting with fewer opportunities to fight?  Or would it have made things more interesting? Would you suggest running the raven as a challenge to be chipped away at and not a full-on fight or do you think it was useful to pull out the fight mechanics and play it out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190556/#Comment_190556" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T11:40:59+00:00" title="January 29, 2009 11:40AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When Thor ran this for us at Origins, the fight was IN the hollow stump.

That said... 8 dice every roll, no matter what (other than maneuvers, I guess)? Brutal! Good to know for the future. I'm only a couple of chapters away from the animals chapter in my more dedicated reading of the hardcopy (prior to running this, I had only skimmed the pdf). I'll see if I can spot any specific bits in the animal chapter that I missed.<br/><br/><br/>Jonathan,<br/>Well, it wasn't just a straight-up fighty-fight Conflict. The mice were doing defensive actions like digging in the snow to escape the beak, the raven did some Feints swooping behind the mice for a moment or Maneuvering into the air. And, like Ralph said, the raven's goal was "Escape with the mail bag". It just happened that, narratively, the mice sort of got the advantage of keeping things on the ground. At the very end, if I recall, the raven did pull out the "Grabs the mail bag and flies away [in a manner that doesn't end the conflict; he hasn't 'gotten away', he's just trying to]" option, but Robin's flying leap for the bag ended the conflict then and there.<br/><br/>In any case, it's definitely worth using it as an opportunity to pull out the Conflict mechanics, instead of just a versus test or series of tests. Conflicts are fun!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish" title="MJ Harnish"><img alt="MJ Harnish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish">MJ Harnish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190649/#Comment_190649" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T09:03:31+00:00" title="January 30, 2009  9:03AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2009 9:06AM by MJ Harnish.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I too have run the Mail Delivery mission as an intro to the game and the raven is one hell of an opponent for a couple of mice: The pair's disposition was at zero by the end of the third volley due to a mixture of very poor scripting (they basically reversed what action each should have taken) and a brutal set of rolls on the raven's part on the first exchange (6 successes vs. 1 on the MG's team). The conflict ended with the raven flying off with the mail bag which obviously opens up an interesting twist to the whole story, since the pair are now setting off to pursue the bird, with Loretta in tow (I introduced her into the story earlier to take advantage of one of the team member's beliefs).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only issue with the game so far (and one which I am meaning to post over on the BW forums about) is that I still don't really understand how the GM &amp; players' turn pacing is supposed to work. Now, I think I understand how it's written in the rules, but in terms of actual play I'm a bit nonplussed about exactly how to structure play during the players' turn, particularly with potential side "adventures." For example, I had an idea of how to turn the pursuit of the raven into the prelude to a much more sinister plot involving the town now in Weasel territory (can't remember the name off the top of my head). Unfortunately, that doesn't really leave any place to fit the players' turn in as far as I can tell. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also don't really understand the purpose of the players' turn in terms of story development, based on the description in the mission, since it seems to replace a lot of actual play opportunity with a single skill check, at least as described in the guidelines (e.g., the side quest to the town in the Weasel's territory). Obviously these can/should be played out but that's not quite the same as treating it like an adventure since there's no opportunity for conflicts, etc. That to me seems to really eliminate a lot of avenues for interesting story development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190654/#Comment_190654" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T09:50:49+00:00" title="January 30, 2009  9:50AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MJ, this should be a new thread. <br/><br/>Also, are you planning on continuing this adventure across multiple sessions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190663/#Comment_190663" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T10:26:15+00:00" title="January 30, 2009 10:26AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me?
