It's the rare ones that deal with science fiction. Note: I'm excluding the plethora of Super Hero RPGs (because I don't rightly know where to classify those).<br/><br/>So the question becomes, is this simply a matter of taste, of coincidence, or is it something inherent in the nature of small press that sci-fi is excluded? Is magic easier essentially easier to handwave, because it's 'make believe' and we can all pretend? Whereas, science is harder to do because it requires plausible explanation, and we all don't have degrees in quantum physics (or whatever) or the space involved in a book to explain?<br/><br/>Just pondering.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* On this particular purchase, I settled on Agon and Hero's Banner. I would have bought Full Light Full Steam, but Joshua's link wasn't working for purchase. Sorry Joshua!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61819/#Comment_61819" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T08:45:02+00:00" title="March 22, 2007  8:45AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude.<br/><br/>Do you REALLY want me to get my google-fu out and make you a list?

That is, frankly, a silly way to state the question.<br/><br/>As far as a <i>trend</i> goes, there is a trend among <i>all</i> role-playing games, in general, towards fantasy. There's nothing inherent to "small press" that would require it either to follow that trend <b>or</b> to buck that trend. So if there <i>is</i> a trend towards fantasy titles, there would be no reason to assume it has anything to do one way or another with their "small press"-ness. Occam's Razor says you should attribute this to their "role-playing game"-ness.<br/><br/>Also, as pointed out by others, there <b>are</b> a pile of small press science fiction games, so this provides negative evidence for your claim that small press somehow excludes sci-fi.<br/><br/>So basically... we can talk about why role-playing games in general might favor fantasy, but a discussion about about it as a phenomenon unique to "small press" doesn't really have any legs to stand on.<br/><br/>You follow?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61879/#Comment_61879" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T19:04:56+00:00" title="March 22, 2007  7:04PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stefan,<br/><br/>Totally with you.

One inseperable idea. Now if instead of D&amp;D;, Traveler had been the game that had cemented itself in peoples minds I think we would have a plethora of Science fiction games and much fewer fantasy games. Players would have grown up playing Traveler and games inspired by and made to compete ith Traveler. They would have house ruled Traveler and eventually turned those house rules into games. They would have published their own "sci-fi heartbreakers". They would have constantly been trying to "get Traveler right". But instead D&amp;D; was the bigger game. I'm sure all these things did happen with Traveler to some extent, but never to the scale that it happend with D&amp;D.;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least that's what I suspect happened.  You can see similar trends in comics, film, manga, video games and pretty much any other young artform.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty" title="MummyKitty"><img alt="MummyKitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/582/nF6IT7RM67QPV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty">MummyKitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61889/#Comment_61889" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T23:23:47+00:00" title="March 22, 2007 11:23PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trends follow the money?<br>\n<br>\nI think it very interesting that in movies the trend was always toward sci-fi before Lord of the Rings.

I don't know the answer to this, but it certainly wsn't because Traveller was a poorer product or that there were less sci-fi fans at the time. For whatever reason D&amp;D; became the most popular game. I imagine (but can't say for sure) it had less to do with the fact that players wanted a fantasy game over a sci-fi game and more to do with marketing, press, word of mouth and perhaps the play experience itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if Traveller had met with the same success as D&amp;D; then there would be parity. People would have entered the industry having played Traveller all their lives and wanting to recreate the experience. As I said before, I think that's why we have so many fantasy games. It has nothing to do with roleplaying being better suited for fantasy and everything to do with D&amp;D; being the first, largest and most public roleplaying game publishing success.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62002/#Comment_62002" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T16:57:48+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  4:57PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been a long time since I played, but isn't Traveller a bit more Hard-ish SF, rather than Space Opera/ Sci-Fantasy?<br><br>I mean, I remember the late 70s/early 80s being way more about Star Wars or BattleStar Galactica, than anything even moderately Hard SF-ish.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62007/#Comment_62007" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T19:34:39+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  7:34PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, Traveller is space opera - my favourite description of it is "the 70s with starships"... <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br><br><br>I think fantasy always wins out because magic is more innately evocative and easier to get into than science and technology (whether social or physical)...<br><br/>... the one place where i think sci-fi in all its stripes has been and still is bigger than fantasy is in table top wargaming - for every Warhammer there seems to be a Full Thrust and a Stargrunt...

It is easy to find a pool of players that are familiar with the Star Trek or Star Wars universe. Fantasy has some wide-ranging Tolkien tropes that make it easier to find people that 'get it'. Still some fantasy games, like Tekumel, are sufficently unfamiliar to hurt them.<br/><br/>In another thread I spoke about how we found D&amp;D much easier to play back in the day, because the dungeon provided the 'game' format. Traveller was a lot slower in finding its preferred format and I don't think it really hit on workable models until supplements like 76 patrons, which had a lot of 'how to play' advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62062/#Comment_62062" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-25T11:35:30+00:00" title="March 25, 2007 11:35AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although I have always loved Sturgeon's definition, I have to admit that popular culture, the true arbiter of definitions in the long term, has irrevocably taken it out to the side of the road and put one behind its ear.<br/><br/>Star Wars is science fiction now.

I disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor one thing, SF purists often seem to want their SF to explicitly state its thesis, and address that topic in a no-nonsense way.<br/>\nSuch as explicitly presenting 3 laws of robotics up front, and then offering concise vignettes which each highlight a specific implication of the robotics speculation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, such a definition denies the genre access to the full variety of powerful storytelling techniques available.<br/>\nSuch as simply presenting droids as a fact of life, with certain coherent parameters to their behavior and status depicted, without making the story<br/>\nmainly -about- the fact that Holy Crap What If Droids Existed!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to offer another example, maybe Star Trek is fantastical as a depiction of a captain in an orderly fleet. (Because Kirk is a swashbuckler who would never get past the personnel dept.)     But on the other hand, Star Trek is solid SF, if you regard it as an understated depiction of the impact of automatic sliding doors on a future society.  (Everybody in the 24th century treats the doors as unremarkable, in juxtaposition against the 1960's audience at home going "Whoa, kewl!")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62084/#Comment_62084" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-25T20:34:21+00:00" title="March 25, 2007  8:34PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In case there was any doubt, I consider genre fantasy real fantasy, and space opera real SF.

Ask random gamers what fantasy gaming is, you'll get answers about elves and magic and swords and kings.  Probably a dragon or two.  Your answer is fantasy = pseudo-Tolkien.  Ask random gamers what science fiction gaming is and you're going to get a whole range of answers: space opera, hard sf, cyberpunk, and others.  The overall concept of fantasy gaming is "genre fantasy", it's what all those hundreds of hundreds of D&amp;D players are playing.  You join a fantasy game, you've got some idea what to expect: heroic humans, elves, dwarves, and short guys against evil orks, kobolds, and other green-skinned critters.  The buy-in is simple in a fantasy game.  You join a science-fiction game, even a space opera game, you don't know what to expect.  Are we playing Star Trek, Star Wars, or Battlestar Galactica?  Because there are so many different visions of the future, including the space opera future, the buy-in is more difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It has nothing to do with specifics -- it's all about expectations.  The D&amp;D fantasy is the definition of a fantasy game to the general gaming public.  There is no science fiction setting, genre, or game that the majority of the general gaming public instantly thinks of when they hear "science fiction game".  This was what my original post was saying in response to Gaerik's second post.  <br/><br/>It doesn't matter that Joshua plays Bronze Age fantasy games.  It doesn't matter that Mike thinks of space opera when he thinks of science fiction.  To the average gamer, fantasy is pseudo-Tolkien.  There is no science-fiction setting type that resonates as strongly as the fantasy/pseudo-Tolkien link. <br/><br/>(cross-posted with Balbinus)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
