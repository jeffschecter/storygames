I'll get the final cover this week and then it's off to Lulu.<br/><br/><b>The Roach Returns</b> is a little book with two alternate settings for The Shab-al-Hiri Roach:  <i>Darker</i>, by Graham Walmsley, and <i>Overlord</i>, by me.  Darker's set in Oxford University in 1863 and Overlord is set in a secret Allied training camp in 1944.  It comes with sixteen custom cards for the settings to tune your Roach deck.  Written, tested, 25% laid out.  <br/><br/><b>Medical Hospital</b> is still in the early design phases but I'm pretty excited about it.  It's got the same "ground truth" problem that Grey Ranks had, in that shouting medical jargon as your patient bleeds out is really fun, but actually learning medical jargon is not so much.  <br/><br/><b>Business Solutions</b> is more or less done and just waiting for time.

Unfortunately my brain was off chasing this before I could stop it. <i>Jaws of the Six Serpents</i> will be a short, snappy instance of PDQ heading in a broadly sword and sorcery direction. Probably off to a few people to have a fiddle with later this month.<br/><br/><i>The Arsenal of Heaven</i> is at least 2/3 done, and I need to get back and finish it off. This is my NUGGETS mini-game of modern folks who acquire the power objects of mythic figures, eg Thor's hammer (or something imbued with its power).<br/><br/>For longer term tinkering there's the <i>Albion</i> Reforged Edition - Celtic-themed fantasy - reworking the Player's Book, and doing the GM's Book which is my very own piece of vapourware.<br/><br/>Phew!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73440/#Comment_73440" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-03T11:39:44+00:00" title="June  3, 2007 11:39AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great idea updating this, Jason. <br/><br/><a href="http://ericjboyddesigns.com/The_Committee.aspx" rel="nofollow">The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</a>, my no-prep, GMless storytelling game of pulp-inspired exploration is getting its text finalized and laid out this month, with pre-orders to follow shortly thereafter (fingers crossed). I'll be at Gen Con demoing and selling the game.<br/><br/><a href="http://ericjboyddesigns.com/IFW.aspx" rel="nofollow">In Frankenstein's Wake</a>, one of the winner's of the BibliOdyssey RPG Design Challenge, is next on my development list. It's an RPG-board game hybrid that is no-prep, GMless, and meant to be played in a single sitting. Think competitive grave robbing, grubbing for funds, and pouring over esoteric books in a race to create your own blasphemous monster before your fellows. I'm looking for interested playtesters, and will be bringing a mock-up to Gen Con in hopes of getting a game in. So a strong alpha, but really only about 20-30% done, I'd guess. <br/><br/><a href="http://ericjboyddesigns.com/Utopolis.aspx" rel="nofollow">Utopolis: Policing the Retrofuture</a>, my entry in the Reversed Engineer Design Challenge, is probably next in line. It's a police investigation game set in the future as imagined by the 1950s where police detectives are actually brainwiped criminals serving their sentence. Playtesting is up next, so there's a lot of development left to go.<br/><br/><i>The Big House</i>, a game of prison drama, has fallen to a lower level in the development stack. I've got a kernal of the mechanics and some throughts on structuring game play using scenes as currency inspired by Burning Empires. There's still a hell of a lot of work left, though, and several games likely to be completed first.<br/><br/><i>Children of the Magi</i>, my Game Chef 2007 entry, is a children's game (ages 5 to 8) set in ancient Persia where magi-in-training move about the emperor's palace helping others and learning what it takes to become one of the Magi. My daughter is much too young to play, so anyone with kids of the right age would be welcome to playtest, drop me an email or whisper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73442/#Comment_73442" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-03T12:21:34+00:00" title="June  3, 2007 12:21PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As always, <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>.

I've had a few blocks along the way, but i'm past my alpha playtest stage and am looking to begin my beta playtest (i'll probably post a "hey who is able/willing to help out" thread soon).  I'm now only 75% sure it will be ready for GenCon (and i'm not really sure how i will finance it's printing) but at worse it will be ready by the end of the summer. The nature of the beast requires that i write edit layout and generat art all at the same time (its VERY graphical). That makes it hard to say exactly how far along i am, because i still need to do all of those things, but have done an aweful lot of them already. <br/><br/>Record of Threats: a Primitive suppliment. Is well sketched out and playtested. It needs to have like 2 more drafts written and edited, and then i need to generate art for it. Then i need to print it. This sounds daunting but because i've already playtested the material, and its pretty much just flavor stuff, i'm not super concerned. I think i could whip out the art in a weekend, making drawings for Primitive is almost instinctual now. This will totally be ready for Gencon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73471/#Comment_73471" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-03T17:10:05+00:00" title="June  3, 2007  5:10PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, actually I'm still stewing over my unfinished Game Chef entry, the variously titled Last Days of the Kingdom, a game about nobles reminiscing about their pasts the night before the peasants burst in to chop off their heads.

It was one of those great playtests where we had a great time and completely didn't follow the rules, so I obviously have to distill what we <i>did</i> do into a new set of rules. Not everything is being thrown out, but most of it is, including the Yes-But cards. Sorry, Jason; they'll turn up somewhere. Interestingly the rules I'm coming up with have a lot in common with the stuff I tried to distill from the BSG-esque Fudge game I was in last year.<br/><br/>I haven't quit on <i>You Gotta Do What You Gotta Do,</i> my also-not-winning entry from Morningstar's other contest. That's right, the owlbear one. And it, too, stepped out of playtest quite clearly wanting to be a completely different game from what I thought it was. I have lots of ideas for how it's gonna come together but the system just won't gel. James Ernest wrote an essay about game mechanics vs. their themes, and wrote that he always makes himself come up with themes first and builds systems to fit because the other way is too difficult for him. I think I work the other way. I know exactly what at-the-table experience I want to have happen but can't sort how to get there. The only reason it's going okay for Outside Men is because that experience is a little more conventional.<br/><br/>I really like how Shreyas and J-Walt are doing their process with Secret Wars. <i>I'm scheming.

It's a game which uses leather cords threaded with beads of various colors to represent characters. Recent changes to the rules (from the GC version) include replacing the dice mechanics with a bead pull, better explaining the system of narration, and the use of a designated Story Cord to represent in-story opposition or challenges. I've had one playtest, which went great, and I'm looking for more locally. I need to work on writing up the rules revisions as well as creating material for teaching how to play the game.<br/><br/><a href="http://kynn.com/games/" rel="nofollow">Wandering Monsters High School</a> was my 24-hour game that I wrote in 2005; it's set in a generic, D&amp;D-style fantasy world...but in high school. I haven't done much on this lately; the game needs rewriting and updating based on not only having more time to work on it, but also what I've learned about game design lately. Another delay has been that my artist for the project had her house burn down, and I haven't been big on bothering her to finish my commissions yet. I probably should kick that into gear. She did some <a href="http://kynn.com/games/wmhs/" rel="nofollow">great roughs of character designs</a> for me last year. WMHS needs some more playtesting.<br/><br/>The next game I'm going to write is called <b>Descanso Highway</b> and it's a ghost story game in which you try to decipher why you died tragically on the road, based on what people have left behind on your roadside memorial, using scrapbooking as the game mechanics. Your "character sheet" is an ever-evolving sheet of scrapbooking paper that is passed around as other players add to it and ask you questions that lead up to "why did you die?" -- the answer to which frees your soul from this world and allows you to continue on the next. It's not quite a roleplaying game but more of a storytelling exercise with props.

But Uml\xc3\xa4ut must come first.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73527/#Comment_73527" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T06:09:06+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  6:09AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2007 3:44PM by Malcolm Craig.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/279" rel="nofollow"><b>Everlasting Empire</b></a> was on hiatus for a while, but after the enthusiasm of the Spodley Grange playtest event, I'm now pushing it forward again. There's also some artwork for it, which I'll get round to posting at some point. So, my dream of a game with space dreadnoughts design by Charles rennie Mackintosh, men with moustaches and mechanics where smoking (for the characters) plays an important part may one day come to fruition!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/299" rel="nofollow"><b>Okhrana</b></a> kind of came out of nowhere for me, starting as an entry into the Modus Operandi 24 hour Epsionage RPG contest. However, I've become more and more keen on it and recent playtesting and feedback on various fora has encouraged me to move it forward. I admit, playing Russian political emigres in late 19th century Paris dodging the attentions of the Czarist secret police is something of a niche, but it's a game I'm so far quite pleased with.<br/><br/>And the the UK Games Expo at the weekend, Andy Kenrick and I decided to collaborate on a game which features a shared enthusiasm for the Royal Air Force, circa World War 2. So, expect further news on our game tentatively entitled <b>'The Few'</b>, where you take the role of bold fighter pilots and develop the story of their young lives as the Battle of Britain rages overhead.

I'm hoping the major changes are out the way now and it'll all be refinement, but we'll see. I'm onto my 5th complete rewrite now and I'm hoping this will become the external playtest doc in a few weeks or so. Keith's splendid art is all done too.<br/><br/>Next up is probably <a href="http://www.game-chef.com/workshop/?PostBackAction=Download&amp;AttachmentID=231" rel="nofollow">Lost Days of Memories and Madness</a>, my Game Chef 07 entry about decadent elves trading and stealing memories (or "the game about bored elves" as Walmsley keeps calling it. Grr.). I managed a playtest of it the other week and it went so well I'm bumping it into production. I've got a couple of the players from that test wanting to run it for their own groups, so hopefully I'll get some useful feedback from that.<br/><br/>Further down the list on the big stack of half-baked ideas and games I have:<br/><br/><b>Yesterday's Tomorrow</b>, my dystopian epic, is somewhere on the stack, although as the real world becomes more dystopian I have to keep going back and making YT even more so.<br/><br/><b>One Giant Leap</b> is a new one to add to the stack, which is my game of space expedition and doom on other worlds, inspired by the likes of 2001, Solaris and Sunshine.<br/><br/>Ordinary Angels is my game based on my friend Todd's indie film of the same name, which is best described as the Shield meets the Prophecy. Angels as cops, struggling with duty, honour and humanity, all in the battle between heaven and hell for the souls of humanity. Deep stuff, but awesome as all hell. Or heaven.<br/><br/>Finally, as Malcolm mentioned, we threw together some tentative plans for a game based on the Battle of Britain called <b>the Few</b>. Dogfighting airplanes, the Hun, mission briefings, little planes getting pushed about a big map and poignant scenes with loved ones and comrades abound.

Otherwise, I imagine that posting such a question on the FateRPG list will probably get me some responses.<br/><br/>I've got lots of stuff written for it (and I've been Photoshopping public domain art into atmospheric pics, and trying out layouts) but the playtesting is at an early stage, and combat is not entirely to my satisfaction yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73634/#Comment_73634" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T13:49:54+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  1:49PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2007 9:39AM by Sydney Freedberg.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>apocalypse girl</i> has had a couple more "one-turn playtests" of badly broken rules sets since November, and I've finally shot one of my personal sacred cows, namely that all characters and setting elements must during play without any kind of prep work; having been through collaborative wordbuilding processes, e.g. <i>Burning Empires</i>, I've decided the value-added of the right procedures for prep, both in social terms of getting the group humming and in-game terms of creating elements to play with, is just too high to ignore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73645/#Comment_73645" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T14:30:06+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  2:30PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (First: dang, this is a lot of games, and second: I am glad to hear that <i>apocalypse girl</i> is still underway.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73653/#Comment_73653" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T14:49:10+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  2:49PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I referred to in the November thread as Acts of Increasing Desperation has morphed into the <a href="http://mikerm.blogspot.com/search/label/Pentasystem" rel="nofollow">Pentasystem</a> (link is to my blog posts thereon, with links to PDFs), and I'm working on a fantasy-steampunk setting for it.

So... who knows?<br/><br/><b>Legacy</b> -- This is pretty much in the purely an idea stage but it's an idea that's rapidly taking hold in my mind.  It's a GM-less, single session RPG inspired by the Gloom Card Game.  I basically want a game about a disintigrating family and the mark each member leaves on the world before tragedy befalls them.

Not only are we seeing notes on a lot of cool games, but it gives me an opportunity to announce officially:<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Worlds<br/>\n<br/>\nMark Humphreys, Scott Mathis and Mike Holmes, after working on the Questworlds project (until it's subsequent reassignment to the<br/>\neminent Robin Laws), have teamed together to create a new role-playing game called Other Worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Worlds is very much based on the lessons we learned as a result of that earlier project. As such, it will undoubtedly have some similarities to the base Heroquest system. But it will also be significantly different, reflecting our vision of the sort of game that we always hoped HQ would support (but which it didn't always provide, at least without some modification, and a lot of technique in play). Not a simple imitation of Heroquest, then, but a departure in a specific direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Worlds will be released as a core rulebook of around 100,000 words. Most of that material will be guidance; guidance on playing the<br/>\ngame, guidance on running the game, and guidance on adapting the game to any genre or setting you see fit. We will also be including 'genre<br/>\nsnapshots' for a wide variety of different genres - Fantasy, Science Fiction, Wild West, Pirates, Horror, Superheroes - to enable you to<br/>\nstart playing more or less straight away. The game will be released with some sort of open license, and will be followed up almost<br/>\nimmediately with a few more detailed books on how to play with the rules in specific genres, and even specific settings meant for play<br/>\nwith the rules. Others will, of course, be able to create their own products based off the core rules as they wish as long as they abide<br/>\nby the details of the specific license.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen will Other Worlds be released? Given that we already have a very strong direction, we're hoping it won't take too long for us to take<br/>\nwhat we already have, and fashion the text to what we want it to be. We aren't making any promises, but it shouldn't take too long for us<br/>\nto get to an advanced state. That said, we're committed to thoroughly playtesting the game (both internally and independently), and it<br/>\nwon't see the light of day until such time as that has happened - however long that takes. Our priority is to get this done right as<br/>\nopposed to getting it done quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, we'd like to say a big thank you to everyone who contacted us with messages of support and encouragement. While we are<br/>\ndisappointed that we won't be able to continue working on the Questworlds project, we are looking forward to creating our own game<br/>\nfor publication. We have spent the last few months re-examining our design goals and making sure that we have something new and<br/>\ninteresting to bring to the table. The response from all those who have seen our playtest manuscript has been an unqualified 'yes'. From<br/>\nthat perspective, we thank Moon Design Publishing for pushing us on to create the game that we really wanted to make. This is a real<br/>\nlabor of love for us and we hope it shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you'd like to discuss this project with us, please post about it here: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3247" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3247</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73796/#Comment_73796" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T10:55:22+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 10:55AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see.<br><br><b>Dirty Secrets</b> is humming along well.

Or across town with chicken wings. <br/><b><br/>The Dragon vs The Gun</b> is progressing nicely, I need to work on examples and fluffing it up a bit. This was my highly commended entry in the final Ronnies comp. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a GMless D12 fest pitting chaos and order on a collision course. Another playtest or two and it should be ready for publication. <br/><br/>A little down the pecking order there are: <br/><br/><b>Fragtown </b><br/>A generic skirmish wargame use any figures you like. This began life in Vincent\xe2\u20ac\u2122s game gamies comp (don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know what happened to that). It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a neat little system, lots of in play strategy and scenario options. A few more playtests and it should be good to go.<br/><b><br/>Labyrinths and Lycanthropes </b><br/>A fast paced no-prep GMless dungeon bash with tongue firmly wedged in cheek. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s much better than The Order of The Stick game. Needs a re-write following the last playtest \xe2\u20ac\u201c and more PvP rules. <br/><br/>Further on the back burner:<br/><br/><b>Best Men</b><br/>An Elizabethan setting for <b>Swansong</b>.

So I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got a half finished <b>Heavenly Bodies system</b>, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s pretty cool all your stats are named after planets.  <br/><br/><b>Alien Hominids</b><br/>No word from Tom Fulp yet on this. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a crazy romp based on the video game. Lot\xe2\u20ac\u2122s of fun and a high death count. GMless naturally.   <br/><br/>Plus my secret project. A competitive card based game that can be played with or without RP elements.

It's full of...games!<br/>What an amazing thread we have here. Lot's of awesome work going on.<br/><br/>So what's happening in my neck of the woods? <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shelterstories" rel="nofollow">Stories from the Shelter</a> is nearing completion. I've been (slowly) playtesting it via LiveJournal (actually, a rather lousy way to playtest. Too. Slow.) and in a monthly game (okay, there I'm actually testing the core mechanics grafted into Dark Conspiracy. I have forgiving friends.). I've made little mention of it here before, so let me give a quick precis. SftS is a space opera that focuses on the exploits of human teens secretly recruited off the streets of major cities via emergency shelters to join an interplanetary Police and Protection Corps. It's chock full of space-opera tropes, and can be taken seriously or tongue-in-cheek. I've struggled with the core mechanics, trying to increase players' sense of agency by allowing direct control of narrative for everyone, not just the GM. I've also included Keys-like aspects to help with fleshing out characters. I'ts been a long road, but I think it's just about ready for beta release and general playtesting. Here's a link to the .<a href="http://home.nycap.rr.com/thehudspeths/StoriesAlpha.pdf" rel="nofollow">alpha</a>, if you're interested. The big stuff to finish up is the setting material .<br/><br/>I've also got several games in the few to copious notes stages. My next hottest project, Amnesia: A Game of Self Discovery, is a GMless/Storytelling game involving a group of people who awaken to find they have lost their memories. Traits, Paths, and Capabilities are revealed through Plotlets, an adaptation of Colin Cummin's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2671&amp;page=1#Item_33" rel="nofollow">Secrets</a>  mechanic during game play. You don't know anything about your Character until you trigger a secret to be revealed. I'm working on character records based on Colin Fredericks' <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1234&amp;page=1#Item_7" rel="nofollow">Sigil</a> character records. More on this stuff in a later posting.<br/><br/>I've also got a few more backburnered that have been around for a while: <br/>Deus \xe2\u20ac\u201d The Gods Have Lost Their Way, which catalyzed the Sigils, pits humanity against the gods themselves. They've failed at their jobs, now it's time to clean house.<br/>Nexus, a down-the-rabbit-hole game inspired by Neverwhere, the Nightside, Alice in Wonderland, the War of the Flowers, and many others. That one needs a lot of work, though it may also lend itself to Sigils.<br/>and an as-yet-unnamed post-apocalyptic setting inspired by A Canticle for Leibowitz, the Sword of Shannara, and a host of others. My cool-idea for this one is a magic system based on control and conservation of entropy. It's the second oldest idea, yet the most incunabular.<br/><br/>Q                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74263/#Comment_74263" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T13:18:37+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  1:18PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2007 6:29AM by Andy.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

Or so they think. They all have a relationship to the same femme fatale, and need to get rid of the others by selling them to the police or their enemies to reach their life goals.

You can see it develop right there on GoogleDocs, if you want. The idea behind it is simple: take some of the aspects of traditional gaming that are fun but underrepresented in indie games and boost them up. It's meant to look, on the outside, much like old-school games. There'll be a GM, secret knowledge, a detailed setting, dozens of NPCs, lots of different tools and abilities to mess with, and so on. But the inside is quite a different beast. <br><br>For example, the resolution looks much like task resolution: use a skill and get an effect. But the only available effects are those that impact other characters (or create/influence tools for this purpose), and the way this works is the same whether you're using your sword or your sexuality. So all of the rolls are directly related to conflicts (but there's no independent stake setting; the scope of rolls is given by the skills), and social skills finally have a great deal of value.<br><br>Also, every character has secrets that can be discovered and used as tools, multiple openings to connect other characters to (relationship mapping happens in play), and so on. Basically, virtually everything in the game will be about connecting characters and getting them into and through conflicts. <br><br>Characters are based on passions like fear, rage, faith, lust, and so on. And you can tap into those for a bonus to something, but also exposing vulnerability to others (use your anger, Luke! (and thereby become vulnerable to corruption)). Character development doesn't depend on killing things or overcoming obstacles but on playing through Bangs.<br><br>Basically, this is the game I've always hoped I could discover somewhere. I'm just going to have to write it myself, and it'll take a long ass time to do that.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74764/#Comment_74764" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-10T04:31:29+00:00" title="June 10, 2007  4:31AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "The Roach Returns is a little book with two alternate settings for The Shab-al-Hiri Roach: Darker, by Graham Walmsley, and Overlord, by me. Darker's set in Oxford University in 1863 and Overlord is set in a secret Allied training camp in 1944. It comes with sixteen custom cards for the settings to tune your Roach deck. Written, tested, 25% laid out."<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know what's needed, after that? <i>Season of the Roach</i>, where the Roach wanders into a late-1960's/early-1970's artist commune that's eerily similar to Warhol's Factory. Subplots include the attempted assassination of the head art guru, and the bitchy, overblown politics of who gets the film equipment for who's underground "masterpiece." Drug use and disturbing sex is not optional!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, for that turn-of-the-century dark comedy, we have <i>Today, We Are All Roaches</i>, when the Roach skitters into the United Nations just after 9/11. Can the players head off what looks to be an inevitable breakout of hostilities in the Middle East, or does the Roach get to cause international flare-ups and breakdowns all over the globe?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, we get <i>The Shab-al-Hiri Legacy</i>, where, fresh from it's stunning success in the (hah!) United Nations, it takes a sentimental trip back to it's old school, Pemberton U., only to find that a genetic engineering concern, in exchange for generous school donations, has set up shop in the university's labs. Desperate for a breakthrough, the members of this concern are fighting amongst themselves in between looking for the Next Big Breakthrough. Will they find the Big Idea and the funding they need, or will the Roach subvert them, forcing them to engineer it's alien biology into ordinary roaches, and thus start the inevitable end of humanity?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74771/#Comment_74771" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-10T07:07:43+00:00" title="June 10, 2007  7:07AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great ideas, Carl!

(If miniaturization works for electronics, why not genetics!?) It escaped through a wormhole, and ended up somewhere in Earth's distant past. Now the team has to disguise themselves in various parts of earth history to hunt down and either capture or squish the roach, with capture being immensely preferable. Problem is: apparently this roach was mixed in with some alien species or another, one that is an advanced symbiote. So it may be inside a person. How do you know who's possessed...and who isn't?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe irony: the Roach isn't a Cthulhoid horror, it's a lab experiment that learned to dislike humans from it's time in captivity. Now it wants to establish it's progeny as the dominant species on earth, wiping out humans before they become dangerous. In the end, we did it to ourselves playing God.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74783/#Comment_74783" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-10T08:16:32+00:00" title="June 10, 2007  8:16AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Split the thread already!

INSTEAD....<br/><br/>I'm releasing a preview edition/ashcan @ the Ashcan front. It will be a black and white 16 page quick and dirty can't play the whole game version. It will feature materials that aren't going to appear in the final version (flavor and clues) that can be plugged into the final version when it is complete (sometime in late august early september). It will cost $10.00.<br/><br/>I'm looking to hear back from people about what they think, what needs to be improved, what played well, what didn't. It's a simple game but it still needs field testing.<br/><br/>MOST IMPORTANTLY: when you buy the ashcan version you get a card you can mail back to me with your info. When you do this you will be mailed the complete version of Sweet Agatha for free when it is complete (saving you $2 off the full games cover price). <br/><br/>So buy this ashcan, play a little teaser now and then in a couple of weeks for no additional charge (okay, it'll cost you a stamp) you'll get the full final thing for cheeper (and maybe some extra freebies for helping out in this early stage).

It's mostly done and just needs polishing.  I'm running it at GenCon, using Clint's game <i>Roanoke</i> as setting inspiration.  Can't wait.  Anybody got a good name for a survival horror game, whisper me.  I think <i>Bodycount</i> is a bit too morbid, unfortunately.  Will probably be released for free as HTML and maybe sold as a booklet, perhaps by Christmas.  Not sure yet.<br/><br/>My "mafia apocalypse" true crime scenario for <i>Shock:</i> ("The Last Days of Old Macao") is 60% there, but hasn't been playtested yet.  Maybe I'll break it out before-during-after GenCon, hopefully with Joshua around to see it.  I kinda want to print it as a travel brochure ("See Old Macao Before It Disappears!") and let people send away for a free copy by mailing me a request letter.<br/><br/>My freeform <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> game is probably 75% there.  We've done some playtesting, but not since the most recent updates.  Definitely next on the block.  Gonna try to release it in HTML and PDF formats for free and get a few <i>Avatar</i> fan sites to host it.  Definitely non-commercial, since it's a fandom project.<br/><br/>The second volume of <i>Push</i> will be out by Christmas and will contain some rocking articles by great people.  Drafts have started to come in and I'm super excited.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84192/#Comment_84192" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T22:31:01+00:00" title="July 30, 2007 10:31PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><br/>My freeform<i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>game is probably 75% there.

Then they take the role of a character in that setting and struggle for control of the setting elements to accomplish their goals. To control a setting element, they mark it with dice rolled from a pool. The result looks something like RISK but with dice on a relationship map instead of armies on a geographical map. This process tends to create stories about the smashing together of greed and other human frailties, ideology, and technology. <br/><br/><b>How close to done is it?</b><br/><br/>I have rewritten this thing about six times in the last 2+ years. The rules went through three major changes, where the result was barely recognizable from the last revision. I think I'm close to the end now.<br/><br/>The first draft of the first four chapters is done. I need to rewrite two more large chapters. Will probably do that this week or next. It'll be ready for playtest then.<br/><br/>I have cover art but not a cover. I don't have a back cover. I don't have layout. <br/><br/><b>What can you do to help?</b><br/><br/>Mostly right now I need reader/critiquers and playtesters. Gimme a week or two and I'll have a ready document for you, with some specific questions I'd like a reader or playtest group to answer. I'll be doing some playtesting myself, too, of course.<br/><br/>Once I feel like the game is in an okay state, I need to find someone to do layout for it. I need someone to take my cover art and add titles and turn it into a cover / back cover combination. I'd like to arrange an editing trade with someone else (you edit mine and I'll edit yours).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84679/#Comment_84679" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T10:45:11+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 10:45AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Psi Run's layout is fixed, and it's going to the printer tomorrow or Friday.

And it's 1.30 am, and i had four hours sleep last night and my feet smell hella bad (oops went to a different town didn't bring socks.)<br/>onwards:<br/><br/>wha am i workin on? top three:<br/><br/>1. ready for alpha playtest, just waiting there patiently on the shelf is <b>Dungeon Master Showdown</b>, a narrative control stealing game for about five people. one of the participants writes up a character (which is to say makes up some abilities and disabilities, a name and a description; little else) and the other participants (called <i>Dungeon Masters</i>) prepare a person, a place and an item to later try and work into the narrative.<br/>the game goes like this: the player (character-running participant) starts off the first scene, describes what's going on. then a dungeon master takes over. the other dungeon masters add in little bits of colour and detail, and if the player likes these things, then that DM is able to draw tokens (or rather, ge to keep the tokens they attempted to draw). if the player doesn't like, then bad things happen.<br/>after a while, one of the DMs will have enough tokens to steal narrative control of the game, and takes over as the new facilitator of the character's story. the player, too, has a method of drawing tokens which is not always successful. if the player dislikes something that a DM is putting forward, then the player can spend a token to have each DM (including the active one) present an alternate version of events. play continues with the DM whose version the player chose facilitating.<br/><br/>DMS is pretty much a mashup of Cheap, a game of Joe's which he ran for me in Vancouver, and Dungeons and Dragons. of course i would never actually SAY THAT, for legal reasons. i guess it's a heart breaker, but whose heart is being broken i'm not sure.<br/><br/>that's number one.<br/><br/>number two i'm not taking the sheet off of. it's one of my babies, one of the two game models which i've been working on the longest, and the fourth project (which i also won't be discussing) derives from it. this i can tell you. it seats three. it's a game about people facing internal crisis. it involves active scene framing, is "GMless", and has a greater than 1:1 character:player ratio. i'm hella stoked.<br/><br/>number three: it's an rpg companion to joe's (potentially collectible) card game Models Of God (or is it Models For God? fuck. too tired to search out the truth. i'm pretty sure it's "For" actually.) let's see. that's joe's game about pubescent biker gangs in a dystopic future who are confused and angry and brimming with poor communication skills and homoeroticism. i'm not sure how faithful to the material i'll be, however. i do know that it will take place in a future which is under threat of whatever-comes-after-nuclear destruction, or perhaps that destruction has already happened and we don't know it yet. "whoa, trippy". there'll be radiation-infected folks which will kind of behave like zombies; focused-applicability A.I.s, nanobots, and miles and miles and miles of partially broken-down national interstate highway system, spanning a continent which speaks a derived japanese, a country called Ameruka.<br/>though it could be played for laughs, it's not intended that way. this is a game about fucked up interpersonal and group dynamics. it's about not having had role-models so you don't know what you want or how to get by or what to fucking do with yourself. it's about having a gang of friends that you have to trust because you have no one else to turn to, but you mess them around and they mess you around and not all of you are going to come out of this ok, or even at all.<br/>this game is called <b>Morning of the Sun</b>.<br/>how ready is it? well, you've now read more than half my notes. the system is similar in its details to number two, inasmuch as it seats three, "gmless", operates with a similar but operationally different microcosm principle... greater than 1:1 C:P ratio. damn i love those.<br/><br/>i kind of playtested a stripped-down version the other day, it went well.<br/>as a side note, i took a step back from my Sentai fighter game (forgive me, Jake and Matt and japan, if i spelled that wrong) <b>Lucky Fighter Heartbreak</b> and realized it's pretty much angling for the same things as Morning of the Sun, so i'm subsuming it into that project. there'll also be notes to play MOTS as a DnD-exclusively-dealing-with-the-dynamics-of-the-party-while-they're-traveling sorta deal. "camp time".<br/>i will be seeking out help to playtest this stuff before too, too long.<br/><br/>this is a big step for me. i usually don't tell people about what i'm doing. usually telling people means i lose interest in the project. hopefully that won't happen in this case (just watch, i'll put down all my notes and begin working on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.)<br/><br/>um, yeah. i'm going to sleep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85683/#Comment_85683" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T17:26:06+00:00" title="August  5, 2007  5:26PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a self introduction to those who don't know me, and a "Hey, I'm here!" to those that do...

I'm going to be trying to get some actual games going very soon, probably first in a PbP format (which is new to me) and then maybe some IRC-based and live play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3228/your-game-2007-update-us-again/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3228/your-game-2007-update-us-again">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3228/your-game-2007-update-us-again/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3228/your-game-2007-update-us-again/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3228%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3228%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
