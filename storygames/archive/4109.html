Do you play the game? With how many people? For how long? <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayed RPGs are all cheap. Really cheap. A movie costs $10 for about 1.5 hours of fun, on average. We'll round that down to $6 per man hour of fun. Let's say you play Battle Lore with four people one night (including GM, so a smallish group), for four hours. That's 16 man hours of fun, or $4.38 per hour. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's if you only ever play it once. Play a ten session campaign, and you're down to cents per man hour of fun. If you play, like I have with Heroquest, 200 sessions... that's a couple of cents per man hour of fun (HQ cost me much less, so actually it's at less than a cent per man hour of fun right now for me). <br/>\n<br/>\nPut it this way... name me one cheaper hobby. One. A day of skiiing costs me $50, and that's not including all of the money that goes for equipment (more than $1000, even if you only include stuff that can only be used for skiing). <br/>\n<br/>\nOutdoor jogging. There, that's the one cheaper hobby. Basically you have to find something that's free to do, in order to find something that's cheaper than RPGs. In fact, I have a pretty extensive game collection, just from over the years. Including lots of stuff I haven't played (despite having a general policy against it). I probably have upwards of $10,000 worth of stuff...<br/>\n<br/>\nStill cheap. I've probably played 5000 hours of RPGs easy over the past 30 years. <br/>\n<br/>\nRPG gamers complain about the cost of RPGs... and I just can't fathom it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92057/#Comment_92057" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T07:20:44+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  7:20AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From <a href="http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue4/probrole1.html" rel="nofollow">Critical Miss</a>, one of my favorite all-time RPG articles:\n<h1>The Problem With Roleplaying</h1>\nI had a conservation with a bloke at my work the other week. I mentioned that the latest attempt to launch a printed roleplaying magazine in the UK had apparently failed after two issues. He immediately replied: "Well that's not surprising is it?"<br/><br/>I asked why?<br/><br/>"Well I've only met one roleplayer other than you - and that was a bloke I worked with years ago. There just aren't enough roleplayers to support a magazine."<br/><br/>Numbers. That what we always say to ourselves, isn't it? There aren't enough people. Now I'm not denying that we couldn't do with more, but I think the answer is more complex. His next lines gave me the clue.<br/><br/>"I mean I'm into radio-controlled model planes, and even that's only big enough to support two magazines, at least there's only two really decent ones."<br/><br/>Radio-controlled model planes. Well, as I pointed out to him, I'd only ever met one person into that hobby, ever, and that was him. He was clearly assuming that loads more people were into his hobby than roleplaying, but I don't think that's the case.<br/><br/>I figure there's as many roleplayers as there are radio-controlled flight enthusiasts. Maybe more.<br/><br/>The problem isn't numbers. It's money.<br/><br/>I asked him how much it cost to be into radio-controlled planes. Initially he acted like anyone does when they think you're attacking their hobby, with a robust defence of how little money it needs: "Well you don't need much... you can get started with a few bits of balsa wood and an elastic band..."<br/><br/>Eventually though (I had to prod him a bit) he came up with a ball-park figure of \xc2\xa3300 (about $450) per person per year. That's about what he expect the average person to spend on planes, controllers, tools, books, magazines and so on.<br/><br/>\xc2\xa3300 per person per year. And that's the average person. The serious enthusiasts will spend a lot more.<br/><br/>What about our typical group of five roleplayers, meeting up for a game every Thursday night. You figure they spend \xc2\xa31500 ($2250) a year between them on roleplaying stuff? Some maybe, but I'd guess most of them come some way under that figure.<br/><br/>That \xc2\xa3300 pounds a year that each model plane person spends supports an entire industry, supplying planes, controllers, spare parts and probably a whole lot more crap. And the myriad of companies making up that industry all need to advertise their wares.<br/><br/>And all those adverts support two thick, juicy, thriving magazines.<br/><br/>It isn't lack of numbers that's killing roleplaying.<br/><br/><b>It's because it's too sodding cheap.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92059/#Comment_92059" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T07:22:54+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  7:22AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>RPG gamers complain about the cost of RPGs... and I just can't fathom it.</blockquote>\nAs usual, I agree 100%.

Heck even mnis begin to look like pretty good buys...) are "great dollar to fun hours buys".<br/><br/>However, that value goes down in a bunch of ways, primarily due to the ease of getting a game up and running.<br/><br/>Most board games can be played with two people, a minimum of fuss, and picked up, pulled out, played and put away in a short time period.<br/><br/>Minis wargames cost from around the price of an rpg corebook to around the cost of a modest used car to play. However, they also have the Lonely Fun bonus ( craft project aspect), usually only need two players, and frankly have a much higher visual appeal than non-minis games ( which can be an important recruiting tool). Minis games also tend to have an only slightly longer play time than boardgames (due mostly to set-up/breakdown time).<br/><br/>Now rpgs?<br/><br/>Rule book lengths. I can't usually say enough bad things about this one. Half my interest in the games I'm trying out recently has to do with their vastly smaller page count compared to the average mainstream rpg.<br/><br/>Number of players: Generally more than two are needed. Coordinating the schedules of multiple people can be a hassle al its own.<br/><br/>Play time: Lots of open-endedness with rpgs, plus a culture that favors the long term campaign over the one night, 1-3 hour session.<br/><br/>Anyway, my point is that an unplayed game is too expensive, and rpgs commonly have a number of facets that make them less likely to be played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92070/#Comment_92070" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T07:47:53+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  7:47AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The difference between most radio-controlled hobby enthusiasts and most roleplayers is that the RC guys actually like spending money on their hobby. The high incidence of post-purchase dissatisfaction in roleplaying kills that enjoyment. But when you buy a new engine for your RC car you pretty much know what you're getting. There are objective quality and performance standards. Roleplaying games produce buyer's remorse by promoting dysfunctional social dynamics, making promises they don't deliver on, and by driving sales via hype and via manufactured collectibility.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92079/#Comment_92079" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T08:00:52+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  8:00AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 8:01AM by Graham.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I hate this whole "Is it too cheap?" argument. <br/><br/>There's too many undeclared interests: if you're a game designer, it's in your interests to argue it's too cheap, so you can <i>charge more!</i>; if you're a consumer, it's in your interests to argue it's too expensive, so you pay less.<br/><br/>Sure, I can show you <i>loads</i> of cheaper hobbies: being a Doctor Who enthusiast, walking in the country, cooking.

I pretty much agree with every word you wrote.<br/><br/>When I said game, I definitely meant an RPG. I should have specified. Sorry about that.<br/><br/>Why did I post all this?<br/><br/>Since Gencon I've been involved in or overheard 4 in person conversation about RPGs being too expensive. After asking a few questions I noticed the following in general (there are always exceptions): <br/><br/>People who I spoke to that thought RPGs were too expensive also:<br/>- weren't sure if they would actually be able to play the RPG (time, players)<br/>- wanted to read but not play the RPG<br/>- wanted to buy it so they can keep up to date with new ideas and innovations in RPGs<br/>- wanted to buy it as research for their own game<br/>- download RPGs illegally but will buy if they can convince themselves the price warrants purchasing a printed copy<br/><br/>Several of the people I spoke to who are college students (many working at fast food restaurants) thought several RPGs were expensive but not too expensive (meaning they don't have money to throw around but it isn't completely unreasonable) and they just all split the cost. $30 game split between 6 players... that's $5 each. But these were also cases where they were convinced they would actually play the game 2-3 times. <br/><br/>For me, I don't think RPGs are expensive when:<br/>- I intend to play the game<br/>- I know the person who wrote it and I want to support them<br/><br/>But ultimately, the reason I started this thread is because I don't think I've ever heard someone declare an RPG was expensive that actually actively play it (I'm sure someone has, there are usually exceptions or I could just be completely wrong).  <br/><br/>How does this all measure against your own experiences?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92085/#Comment_92085" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T08:09:42+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  8:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John!

What I mean is that my group would start up with a game when someone bought a copy of the book.  We'd get very excited about it and play like crazy.  Then, for convenience or to support the producers of such a fine game, the rest of the players would pick up the book as well.  Boom!  As soon as we were all invested, interest in the game would drop like a rock.  <br/><br/>This has happened to me with boardgames (<em>Empires in Arms</em>) and RPGs (<em>Gurps</em>, <em>Pendragon</em>).  We did okay with <em>Fudge</em>, but then that one was free.  Last year it happened with <em>Burning Wheel</em>, when our group finally decided to change to a lighter rules game just after I bought the books.  At that point I thought the game was a great value ("$25 for two books? Sweet!") but I haven't had a chance to play it since.<br/><br/>Recently we broke this streak with <acronym title="The Shadow of Yesterday">TSOY</acronym>.  We've used that system to run half a dozen games over the last year and half, even after everybody else in the group bought a copy mid-stream.  So we're squeezing a lot of value out of that game.  <br/><br/><small>Of course I've jinxed it now...</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92102/#Comment_92102" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T08:42:14+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  8:42AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Money I can spare, so cost in dollars isn't a big deal.

Yes, I think that in some cases RPGs are \xe2\u20ac\u0153too sodding cheap,\xe2\u20ac\x9d as noted in that lovely Critical Miss article. Thanx Andy.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcerning buyer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s remorse, as mentioned by Paul, I have to agree that hype, and broken promises are an issue\xe2\u20ac\xa6most especially when games are sold in shrink-wrap. This latter is the culprit in my own instances of buyer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s remorse. I diverge from his opinions, however, where dysfunctional social dynamics are concerned. I think that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s more a pre-existing social issue, than a game material issue. Think gun control, and video game violence debates, and you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re where I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m at on the \xe2\u20ac\u0153bad games make for breaches in the social contract\xe2\u20ac\x9d argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, concerning the suggestion that game designers want more money, while game consumers want to spend less, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not so sure this holds up to my admittedly limited experiences of Indie RPGs. From what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve seen Indie Game Designers seem more apt to sell themselves short in comparison to big box RPG. $20 for a good RPG, or really any RPG, seems really cheap to me, especially if the whole RPG is contained in that one volume. Contrast that with situations where it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s $30+ per volume, but three volumes are needed to play the game properly. I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know about the rest of you, but I spend way more than $20 on pop, coffee, and lunch in a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I like to collect RPGs, so I tend to sooth any remorse by reminding myself that RPGs that have disappointed me are additions to an unfinished collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Brad<br/>\np.s. \xe2\u20ac\u201c Questions like this one make me think that an Indie RPG focused marketing research survey might just be a good thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92174/#Comment_92174" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T10:19:49+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 10:19AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 10:23AM by Graham.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is making me a little irritated.

In my limited observations, and interactions with Indie Designers it is also something that I think Indie, and Small Press could learn better to employ for their own benefit, and benefit of their consumers. I also happen to think that it would make even bigger dents in "business as usual" work-a-day corp arrogance.<br/><br/>Brad                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92387/#Comment_92387" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T21:59:05+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  9:59PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 10:00PM by Moreno R..">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/><br/>A lot of people in this thread talked about the "cost" of a rpg session, comparing it against the cost of a Pizza or a movie. But this is a WRONG calculation, because, if this was not your FIRST rpg you brought, you would play IN ANY CASE, so you must count the price of playing this new game against the price of playing any one of your old games.   And as you can see, this means that you will always found that you always pay more than the alternative. <br/><br/>So, the question is, the enjoyment you will get from this new rpg, is bigger than the one you got from your old game? How much bigger? <br/><br/>And, most important:  how can you know this BEFORE buying it?<br/><br/>We have these cases:<br/><br/>1) "I thought that this would be worth it, but I played it and I don't think I will play again, I enjoy my other games more"<br/>2) "I thought that this would be worth it, and it was true!"<br/>3) "I don't want to risk buying it, it cost too much"<br/><br/>What do I think? I think that the cost for trying new games is already so high (not because they cost too much one by one, but because there are so many of them) that people have almost stopped trying any unknown new indie game, and prefere to wait for a review, or an actual play thread. They can't afford to buy ten new games to discover that only one was good enough for them to be played. So they wait until they are sure, buy the game, and (having waited until they are sure) they usually get result 2.<br/><br/>But result 2 is not the most common. The most common result, you see, is 3. <br/><br/>If Indie rpgs were really "too cheap", I think we would see many more results "1", because people would be less afraid to try them. If you don't get a lot of complain for the "1" it mean that nobody risk buying your game without checking all the review and the actual play, because they don't trust you for that amount of money.<br/><br/>[and remember that the "cost" of trying a new rpg is not only in the money. What about the time to read and memorize the book, and the prep time? Time is valuable to working people...)<br/><br/>You game is too cheap or too expensive? Well, the meaning of that question can change. Only you can decide how much your work is worth, so if you think that you don't want people to play your game without paying you amount X, it's your right to do so and nobody can blame you. <br/><br/>If instead you see the other meaning of that question, as "what price I must choose to get people to buy my game", and you discover that people didn't think that your game was worth X, it's not because they are cheap bastard.  Why they should have trusted you to give them a better playing experience than the games they  already have like MLWM, PTA, InSpectres, BW or DitV?<br/><br/>I spend an insane amount of money in rpgs every year. Most of what I brought until a few years ago was crap, not worth even the time to read it. So I now buy only games from the forge community. I still spend an insane amount of money, but at least I finance innovation and not the same old crap. I buy many more games that I could ever play.  So, I don't get my money's worth from a lot of games, but it's a risk I want to take. Buying a lot of games to find between them the ones i like (so, at the end I really pay twice the price for any one of them that I play). But still I don't buy all the indie games published.  The cost would be too high.<br/><br/>So, what do I buy? Well, if you are Ron Edwards or Vincent Baker or Paul Czege or one of the others that I buy sigh-unseen don't worry, I'll buy it.  If you are not one of them, try to make me read enthusiastic actual plays and glowing recension written by intelligent and articolare reviewers. If you can't get that, you last chance is to cost so little to get me to try you anyway.<br/><br/>The moral? "Cheap" take different meaning (and values), and the right price for Dogs in the Vineyard could not be the right price for your new and unknown game....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TwoCrows" title="TwoCrows"><img alt="TwoCrows" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TwoCrows">TwoCrows</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92391/#Comment_92391" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T23:02:05+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 11:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read a number of voices here saying something to the tune of \xe2\u20ac\u0153value for the money is a subjective opinion.\xe2\u20ac\x9d If I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m reading some of those correctly a few are also saying \xe2\u20ac\u0153subjective price value cannot be measured because it means something different to everyone.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Yes, it does mean something different to many people, but it can, and is in fact routinely measured accurately enough to influence business decisions.<br/><br/>Price Value Ratings are a statistically sound metric in the marketing research industry, and they are derived from the subjective opinions of everyday people, and narrowly selected study groups alike.

The Wilderlands boxed set, for example, is largely maps and keyed encounters with little in the way of rules or actual setting fluff (past some reprinted history from the Player's Guide). In the end, the Player's Guide actually proved to be a far more useful product for me and it costs about 1/3 the retail price of the box set. Similarly, DCC <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2335&amp;Mode=like">#35</a> gave me about as much info as most $34 hardcover setting books do -- but it set me back an additional $40.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
