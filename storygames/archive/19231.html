I'm not qualified to comment on OSR, so you can more or less assume that I'm talking from a Trad/Indie/Story game perspective.<br/><br/>Firstly, people are generally talking about either one or both of two things when they talk about separating player knowledge from character knowledge. <br/><br/>In the first scenario the Character makes use of information revealed at the table, but that his Character could not know. The classic example is Character A suddenly finding the secret door after Character B ferretted the information out of a contact across town. <br/><br/>In the second scenario the Character makes use of information known to the Player, but not the Character. The classic example would be the Player who has memorized the Monster Manual and knows the weaknesses to every monster, or the Player who uses her out of game physics degree to invent a hot air balloon that solves problems for her 13th century peasant character. <br/><br/>Does either of these things matter? As usual it depends on the social contract at the table. Many Story and Indie games get around these problems by distributing narrative authority and diminishing or eliminating secret knowledge. My understanding is that typically OSR doesn't even bother with the distinction. Under the wrong circumstances they can be troubling in different ways. <br/><br/>From an Immersion stand point they can result in some pretty jarring moments. <br/><br/>The first scenario is more problematic in a situation where a Character skill system is important to the game. If Susy the fighter suddenly knows everything that Maigret the Scholar's knowledge skills discover, then it's harder for Maigret to get those spotlight moments where he gets to shine. Unless it's been discussed at the table this sort of thing can be a serious cause of thunder stealing and result in hard feelings. <br/><br/>The second scenario is most troublesome when the other players at the table are trying to immerse themselves in a style of play or setting. It's especially troubling in games where the source material is public knowledge (like historically accurate games, or liscenced games). In the wrong circumstances this can be immersion poison as it introduces jarring non-sequitirs, or short circuits elements of the setting that the players found valuable. <br/><br/>Edited for spelling.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428483/#Comment_428483" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T12:01:56+00:00" title="February 20, 2014 12:01PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly, it's all about table manners, about everyone's immersion, not about your own immersion.

How much harder?  Depends on how relevant the knowledge is to my character's decisions.  If, for example, my job is to solve problems from character POV while excluding my own relevant knowledge from the solving, then that utterly destroys my <i>identification</i> with my character.

Not only does something like that undermine what I wanted as a player (I'm opening the safe because I want to discover what's inside, not because I want to tell you what's inside), generating information about the world is an entirely different headspace for me than figuring out what my player sees in that world. So whenever possible, I like to keep those activities entirely separate: if I'm playing a character, I want to play the character and not the world; if I'm playing the world, I don't want to play a character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

from metagame itself, but by the surrounging system in use.<br/>For example, in OSR games (and many styles of "traditional" play) the table activity mainly boils down to an ongoing challange between Players vs Master and sometimes even Players vs Players.<br/><br/>Usually metagame does no harm.<br/>Knowing that yesterday Sir Roland left a pair of boots at the shoemaker shop to be repaired is just color, and everybody is happy to know that because it better portrais that character.<br/><br/>The problem arises when that information becomes relevant to the interests of someone.<br/>Let's say Sir Tordos wants to ambush Sir Roland and lays a trap on the road to the shoemaker shop, anticipating that his target will go back there to fetch his repaired boots.<br/><br/>In a non-competitive game this situation bears no problems and can be solved in thousands of interesting ways.<br/>Having Sir Roland go toward the trap could actually be an interesting and desired choice, so Players are happy to know all the info, so they can be more effective "agents" in the game.<br/><br/>But in a competitive game this out-of-game knowledge poses a very aggravating <b>conflict of interests</b>.<br/>Reasonably Sir Roland could have gone to the shop, or could have sent a servant, for whatever reasons.<br/>If his armorer ass is saved by pure luck, it <b>feels </b> "fair" and no one compleins.<br/>But now the Players know, and "nature" can no longer make its course... whatever happens is no longer "fair".<br/>If I send a servant it could look and feel like I'm cheating, as I'm benefiting from intel Sir Roland does not have.<br/>If I send Sir Roland toward an obvious trap I'm hurting my interests in the game, in the name of sheer peer pressure and some idea of supposed "good roleplay".<br/><br/><br/>In my experience, nine times out of ten <b>this</b> conflict of interest is what breaks the game, and breaks the so called "immersion".<br/> </div>\n<div

I didn't realize that immersion was so widely defined in so many ways. My conception of it prior to the answers here and elsewhere was very narrow and basically limited itself to "Character Immersion" in that very strict sense where you want as little OOC knowledge as possible. <br/><br/>Interestingly, the peeps in this forum slant heavily towards liking or not minding OOC knowledge as far as their immersion goes. Whereas in RPGNet, I got a little slant towards this, but the results so far are much more mixed. It's very informative, and I think my horizons have been expanded. Thank you all. <br/><br/>I don't want to muddy the waters more, but the matter of immersion might be closely related to stances. I just happened to be reading  <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2011/08/31/stances-101/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2011/08/31/stances-101/</a> and the descriptions sort of match some of the different preferences that have been expressed. <br/><br/>As for my own preference, I don't know that I have one, but my only, and perhaps best RPG experience so far was with a GM who strictly kept OOC knowledge from us by physically separating the group when someone was having a separate scene. It did lead to a bit of boredom during, but having stuff revealed to you later in game was kind of nice.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I know I would get a lot of enjoyment out of having certain OOC knowledge and enjoy putting the character in certain situations based on that. I suspect that it would make me see the character in a bit of a detached way, though. A bit like how I see a character in a CRPG in that 2/3 view mode. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428552/#Comment_428552" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T08:42:55+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  8:42AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>... when I, the player, don't have information my character either doesn't know, doesn't understand, refuses to believe or can't grasp the significance of. </blockquote>\nIt is a fun space to play inside, no?<br/><br/></blockquote>\nIn the same way that playing Pin the Tail On The Donkey or Blind Man's Buff is a fun game to play.

This isn't what I normally want to immerse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428553/#Comment_428553" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T08:58:27+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  8:58AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>As for my own preference, I don't know that I have one, but my only, and perhaps best RPG experience so far was with a GM who strictly kept OOC knowledge from us by physically separating the group when someone was having a separate scene.

The seperate sessions help preserve the potential for surprise, but they can generate problems with pacing and the appearance of favoritism. <br/><br/>I've seen note cards used to good effect to preserve some of that secrecy without taking the time for a side session, and I imagine text messages could have the same effect. I've also experimented with prelude sessions in some games where the side sessions were taken care of before the main game. In one extreme case (a 20 player Vampire semi-LARP with a lot of political maneuvering) I've even experimented with a secondary GM/NPC specialist who had the authority to take players aside while the main session continued. <br/><br/>At this point my general preference is just to trust my players to deal with information well.

It's not something I shoot for all the time, or even something I would do in every game (given the chance) but it's super fun for me.  Especially when it happens without a lot of meta-game discussion.  (i.e. I build a character that loves Jeff and doesn't know that Jeff is already married to Samantha.  Then my character gets pushed into a scene where I make a really positive connection/relationship with Samantha.)<br/><br/>It usually leads to some great stuff.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerulean" title="nerulean"><img alt="nerulean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerulean">nerulean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428603/#Comment_428603" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-22T01:23:53+00:00" title="February 22, 2014  1:23AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>At this point my general preference is just to trust my players to deal with information well.

It can be done well but it generally isn't, and when the writers of a show start to rely on this story structure again and again, I stop watching.<br/><br/>It's a totally different thing around the gaming table, though. With players I trust, I'll actively help set up this kind of situation, because unlike it being lazy writing to set up tortured interactions and an agonising reveal later on, I know it's going to pay off in a way that adds something to the game and the characters' lives.<br/><br/>Having some information there out of reach helps set 'minigoals' for a game, pointing out possible directions for the group to take the narrative. If my character doesn't know something and really needs to in order to get to the spice of the story, how could he find that out? Scene framed. If my character doesn't know something and it's more satisfying not to rectify that ignorance immediately, how could it put him in a situation where it creates drama, complications or other juicy ways to make the game more interesting. It can help pace the game, especially if you're playing in a system without an inherent structure that its stories tend towards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
