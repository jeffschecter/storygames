The Prussian town is key to the defense of the Eastern flank and Army Group North will fight to the bitter end to protect it. <br/><br/><br/><br/>We played 4 scenes pregnant with juicy conflicts.  The first scene involved the Volkssturm squad heading into the edge of the town to evacuate German civillians following the fall of the 1st line of defense.  After evacuating a handful of citizens, the squad hunkered down in an apartment building as intermittent artillery bursts rang out along the rooftops.  A Wehrmacht soldier on a loudspeaker announced the arrival of the Soviets in the district and the troops sought to ambush a Red Army infantry column supporting a T-34 Russian Tank.  The conflict ended in the first Moment (round) as OberGrenadier Dreyman found himself pinned in the alley clutching his Panzerfaust.  Unterfeldwebel Wilhelm had trouble maintaining his troops' composure and they opened fire prematurely, forcing the group to evacuate in order to avoid the wrath of the approaching tank.  <br/><br/>The next two scenes were only a few hours later in game time, involving the group being assigned reconnaissance duty near the 2nd line of defense in order to gauge the Soviet approach.  We established the poor armament of the Volkssturm squad and the fact that they were being treated as 2nd citizens in the face of the Wehrmacht OberLeutenant in charge of their line.  After a brief conflict to establish the Volkssturm's group autonomy, they headed out to the industrial sector of the city.  This is where the group found shelter in an abandoned bakery, spotting a nearby Stalin II Tank Crew enjoying a moment a peace.  Grenadier Schneider quietly dispatched with two Soviet riflemen before the group made a stealthy departure in order to head back to home and report on their findings: The Red Army was close and gearing up for war.<br/><br/>The final scene featured the squad spiritously fighting to hold their section of the 2nd line against an onslaught of Russian Artillery/Rockets and advancing armor supported infantry.  Some really stellar descriptions found their way into this conflict colored intensely by the 3 Strains in Black Cadillacs (Horror, Hubris, and Valour).  A moment of horror gripped OberGren. Dreyman as his scavenged PPSh jammed in the face of an approaching line of bayonet wielding infantry.  Gren. Schnieder sought to pick off a tank commander who was abandoning his iron coffin, only to have his shot thrown off by the shower of gore of a nearby comrade.  We also saw an intense moment of Valour displayed by the UnterFeldwebel as he rallied his men from fleeing, forcing them to hold the line much longer than anticipated.  In the end, however, the troops were forced to retreat as the approaching group was much too strong.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the end game mechanics of BC are quite gripping.  You pose three questions to the group and answer them with a clever trick taking card game.  Our three questions included:<br/><br/>Q.What happened to the boy (a 15 year old member of the squad who Schnieder took under his wing - he dissapeared in the final assault)<br/>A. He was captured, sodomized and killed (Poison'd meets the Eastern front?)<br/><br/>Q. How do the troops under the OberLt. view the Volkssturm squad in the wake of the final assault?<br/>A. The Volkssturm squad was seen as the first to break, fleeing the defenses and causing the whole line to cave in.<br/><br/>Q. Were we (the squad) betrayed? (This was an awesome open ended question posed by one of the players - it referenced a Rumour which alludes to the OberLt. possibly being a Commie traitor)<br/>A. The OberLt. placed the Volkssturm squad in a vulnerable position so that blame could be easily levied on them (we still don't know where his true loyalties lie).<br/><br/>Then the group reveals what cards they have left to determine Who Dies, Who Gets Away (leaves the war/group), and Who is distinguished.  We sadly learn that the UnterFeldwebel was killed as he held off the final wave overwhelming their defensive line so that his men could get away.  Both Grenadier's were distinguished and it was decided that Schneider will receive a field promotion next session (He will be the new squad leader).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177815/#Comment_177815" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T21:35:03+00:00" title="November  8, 2008  9:35PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We all loved the game immensely.  Conflicts seemed to arise relatively naturally and we all had a hell of a time sharing narration of the scenes in the Rising Action phase (pre-conflict free play).  The only times I felt a little hand-cuffed were when a clear conflict would arise but one of the troopers would disagree with the groups actions (there was some arguing with the OberLt. and Grenadier Schnieder agreed with the Extra rather than with his own squad).  I believe we handled this correctly as we worked out the goal of the conflict to be congruous with every member.  It just took a moment to let it work itself out and then we were fine.<br/><br/>The player's received their homework and I cannot wait to hear their stories next time we play.  We already tossed around the idea that Schnieder's story would occur at his field-promotion ceremony as he receives a medal for his valour and his CO relays his heroic tale.  We definitely are excited about the next session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178053/#Comment_178053" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-10T13:51:56+00:00" title="November 10, 2008  1:51PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey Story-Games,</p>\n<p>It's really hard to resist the urge to bounce off the walls at the enthusiasm in Charles' post.</p>\n<p>However, I just wanted to say that for the sake of sanity, I'm doing the bulk of my design-talk stuff about this session of Black Cadillacs <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26991.0" rel="nofollow">over at the Forge</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, I can bounce of the walls.

I do, however, have a solid understanding of the major battles of the Eastern Front.  I knew very little of Konigsberg initially, rather, I had suggested we play as a squad of Volkssturm and that was one of the major battles they participated in that popped up in my research.  I thought focusing on Volkssturm would be very rewarding with the diversity of the group and unique perspective and the players really dug it.  I was tossing around Stalingrad before settling on Volkssturm but for some reason it didn't jazz me quite as much.  I have two History majors in my gaming group and considered majoring in History myself, so we pretty much have a simple time adherring to realism.<br/><br/>As an aside, I'm keen on trying out a Roman campaign (I just finished season 1 of HBO's Rome), as well as Vietnam.  I ended up pushing World War Two the hardest in our War Creation time as I wanted to do something I was familiar with so that I could focus on learning the rules and keeping play moving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
