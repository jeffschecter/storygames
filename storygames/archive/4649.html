An 18th century bodice-ripping farce about a young vicar with divided loyalties, a landlord who plays both sides, his ripe young daughter, and a thrill-seeking yet deeply confused highwayman. This is a special one-shot starting with episode 2. With proper funding and the high ratings it received, there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a strong possibility this will get a full season in the future.<br/><br/>Starring...<br/>Vincent as Vicar Stephen Foote<br/>Meg as James Fawcett the landlord<br/>Julia as Benjamin Smith/Elizabeth Rutherford, the highwayman.<br/>Produced by Joshua<br/><br/>As our show begins, we see the lawmen leading a young man through a crowd to the gallows. It is the infamous and ruthless highwayman Benjamin Smith, just apprehended the night before.<br/><br/>**Flashback to the previous night** Ben Smith hides in the shadows, atop his horse. An unnamed accomplice is by his side. Down the road, they hear a horse drawn carriage. <br/>Highwayman 1: \xe2\u20ac\u0153You ready?\xe2\u20ac\x9d <br/>Ben Smith: I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t think we should bother. It sounds like a rickety old carriage. It won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be worth it.<br/>Highwayman 1: It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s heavy. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a full prize.<br/>Smith: Something\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not right.<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\u0153The road was a ribbon of moonlight.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>Ambush! In the confusion, Benjamin Smith manages to shoot a few of the assailants, but in the end, they pull him off his horse and beat the devil out of him before they arrest him.<br/><br/>Cut to Benjamin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s cell. The Vicar Rev. Foote arrives to take Benjamin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s confession. He starts to confess and then asks the Vicar to send for his mother, Lady Rutherford. <br/><br/>Vicar: But lady Rutherford has no sons, only a daughter.<br/>Smith: That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s right. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not this Benjamin Smith fellow. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m Elizabeth Rutherford. This is a case of mistaken identity!<br/>Benjamin/Elizabeth gives the Vicar a convoluted explanation of why she was out late at night, armed to the teeth, and dressed as a man. She had a suitor, and she was unsure of his intentions, so she disguised herself as a man and met him on the road at night. He figured out she was a woman and tried to attack her. While she fended him off, out of the bushes came the all these other men. In fear, she shot them and tried to escape. <br/>Vicar: Why didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t you tell them who you were?<br/>Benjamin/Elizabeth: I was being attacked by one man, chased by others, at night, alone. It didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t seem like the proper thing to do.<br/><br/>The Vicar runs off to fetch Lady Rutherford to alert her that her daughter is about to face the gallows as the highwayman Benjamin Smith. On the way, he tries to convince the hangman to wait until he returns, or he\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll hang an innocent man, er, woman.<br/><br/>At the Fawcett Inn. James Fawcett tells his daughter that her sweetheart Benjamin Smith is about to be hanged. Now she can move on and find a suitable husband. He doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t notice the ring on her left hand. Nor does he convince her that this is the best thing for everyone. She runs off.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Vicar goes to the Rutherford manor. He tries to explain to lady Rutherford that her daughter will be hanged at dawn if she does not go with him to help her. <br/><br/>Lady Rutherford: My daughter is fine! She\xe2\u20ac\u2122s in her room.<br/>Vicar: No, she\xe2\u20ac\u2122s about to be hanged as a highwayman. <br/>Lady R.: The old Vicar would have known to attend to these matters at a reasonable hour! Let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s go to my daughter\xe2\u20ac\u2122s room and I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll show you she\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fine.<br/>But Lady Rutherford realizes she can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t protect her daughter\xe2\u20ac\u2122s secret and save her life at the same time. In the end, she goes with the Vicar, and brings her (brutish and loyal) butler to help them. On the way out, Rev. Foote takes an ornamental knife\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa6And in the next scene, we see him using the knife to cut Elizabeth/Benjamin down from the gallows, while the butler restrains the hangman.<br/>[This is where the show takes a surreal turn]<br/><br/>Cut to the Rutherford manor. Lady Rutherford warns her daughter (still dressed as a man) that she should stop before she is killed. She was lucky this time. Elizabeth refuses. She reminds her mother that they\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll end up in the poor house. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Better the poor house than dead\xe2\u20ac\x9d says Lady Rutherford. \xe2\u20ac\u0153You should work on finding a husband.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Elizabeth still refuses (being a highwayman is profitable and fun!), even after Lady Rutherford reminds her about Lord Rutherford\xe2\u20ac\u2122s demise. <br/>Elizabeth: At least he died with a smile on his face.<br/>Lady Rutherford sends Elizabeth to her room to rest, and to change into appropriate clothing. Elizabeth obeys, and with a glint in her eye, Elizabeth says, \xe2\u20ac\u0153We should have to Vicar over for dinner to thank him.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>Elizabeth retires to her room. Before she changes into women\xe2\u20ac\u2122s clothes, she spies the landlord\xe2\u20ac\u2122s black-eyed daughter, Molly Fawcett, sleeping in her bed. Elizabeth speaks as Benjamin. It becomes clear that Molly knows the truth, although he denies it repeatedly. The evidence is on the wall, in the form of a lovely portrait of Lady Rutherford and her daughter Elizabeth. The portrait of Elizabeth and the disheveled young \xe2\u20ac\u0153man\xe2\u20ac\x9d standing before Molly bear a striking resemblance. Molly gets frustrated with Benjamin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s bluffing, throws her ring at him, and storms out. <br/><br/>Later that evening, Lady Rutherford and her daughter have dinner with Rev. Foote, much to the Vicar\xe2\u20ac\u2122s horror. Lady R. regales him with ribald tales about her husband, and how he died with a smile on his face. At an opportune time, Lady Rutherford leaves the young Vicar and Elizabeth alone. <br/><br/>Elizabeth offers Rev. Foote some scotch. Lots of scotch. The Vicar notices how Elizabeth drinks it downs like a man in a tavern. There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s lots of talking around issues. Rev. Foote advises Elizabeth to find a husband, that surely she has suitors. She mentions that she does have a sweetheart, but no, the Rev. shouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t speak to this person on her behalf. Elizabeth talks about the previous Vicar\xe2\u20ac\u2122s expensive taste in fine jewelry, with a disquieting fondness. (The old Vicar \xe2\u20ac\u0153died on the road\xe2\u20ac\x9d) It is unclear whether the Vicar makes the connection between Elizabeth\xe2\u20ac\u2122s dressing as a man and riding around at night, and frequent highwayman attacks on the area\xe2\u20ac\u2122s roads. When he excuses himself for the night, Elizabeth makes it known that she\xe2\u20ac\u2122d like to see him again.<br/><br/>Cut to Mr. Fawcett\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Inn. A drunk Benjamin Smith enters, and sits with Mr. Fawcett. Benjamin tells Mr. Fawcett that in light of recent events (nearly being hung), he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s taken stock of his life and wants to settle down. With Molly Fawcett.  Mr. Fawcett doubts Benjamin would be able to settle down and make an honest living, and not leave his daughter a young widow. He refuses to give his blessing. Frustrated, Benjamin threatens he will take Molly with or without Mr. Fawcett\xe2\u20ac\u2122s blessing. This doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t go over well. Mr. Fawcett counters with his own threat. If Benjamin doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t pay him more money, the roads will be much more dangerous for him.<br/><br/>More later!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105063/#Comment_105063" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T15:06:53+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  3:06PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love how you have kept the number of locations limited, highly appropriate for a late-night bodice-ripper where everyone has to pop in and out of the same doors and dress up as each other and hide in each other's closets and under each other's beds.

It was supposed to be a costume drama, but somehow it attracted the eye of the execs at Cinemax.<br/><br/>So...Benjamin rides home.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Vicar walks home and meets Molly Fawcett sitting under a tree, sad and dejected. He invites her to his home for a cup of tea and a shoulder to cry on. She gives him an earful; he consoles her.  They have sex. (Divided loyalties, right?) Benjamin/Elizabeth passes the Vicar\xe2\u20ac\u2122s home on his way to the Rutherford manor and catches an eyeful. He/she waits by the vicar\xe2\u20ac\u2122s house until dawn and confronts the two when Rev. Foote walks Molly home. <br/><br/>Benjamin (seething): Good morning.<br/>Molly stands speechless. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s awkward all around. The Vicar, before recognizing Benjamin Smith, tries to be polite, extends his hand for Benjamin to shake, and introduces himself. Benjamin leans over to return the gesture, and glares at Molly. Then the Vicar recognizes the man as Benjamin Smith: the same man condemned to die less than a day prior, from whom he took the strange confession. The same man who turned out to be a woman.<br/>Rev. Foote: Elizabeth?<br/>Benjamin/Elizabeth dismounts her horse. She\xe2\u20ac\u2122s completely confused. She looks at Molly, and trying to regain her manly composure says, \xe2\u20ac\u0153You fucked the Vicar!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>Molly slinks away. Benjamin/Elizabeth mutters, \xe2\u20ac\u0153bitch\xe2\u20ac\x9d as she leaves.<br/>Ben/Liz stares at the ground, lost in her thoughts, confused. Her secret's out. She repeats, \xe2\u20ac\u0153This is all very awkward.\xe2\u20ac\x9d \xe2\u20ac\u0153You fucked my Molly.\xe2\u20ac\x9d \xe2\u20ac\u0153You fucked the Vicar.\xe2\u20ac\x9d \xe2\u20ac\u0153I thought you and I might have something, Reverend\xe2\u20ac\x9d. The vicar asks if Molly will be okay getting home alone, and Elizabeth says yes. Then Rev. Foote invites her in for tea.<br/><br/>They talk at length about dressing as a man, landlord\xe2\u20ac\u2122s daughters, and love. In the end, Rev. Foote agrees to put in a good word for Elizabeth with Mr. Fawcett. He tells her that she is not Benjamin Smith, and that she must stop going around dressing as a man. Something about making angels in heaven weep. At this point, Elizabeth has no idea who she is. Elizabeth Rutherford, Benjamin Smith. What does it matter? The Vicar convinces her to go to Molly and be honest about who she is.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Molly Fawcett returns to her father\xe2\u20ac\u2122s inn. He tells her that Benjamin came calling for her earlier. He did not hang. Molly is unconcerned. She tells her father that she was with the Vicar all evening. He likes this. Better the Vicar than a scalawag like Smith. Molly retires to her room and goes to sleep. She\xe2\u20ac\u2122s been up all night.<br/><br/>Later she hears Benjamin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s familiar tap on the window. She doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t answer. Elizabeth, dressed as a woman, climbs into Molly\xe2\u20ac\u2122s window and stands at her bed. <br/>Elizabeth: How long have you known?<br/>Molly: A while.<br/>Elizabeth: And it doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t matter to you that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m a woman.<br/>Molly: no.<br/>Elizabeth: You fucked the Vicar!<br/>Molly tells Elizabeth that she just wants her to be honest with her. Elizabeth asks Molly if she still wants to be with her. Molly says she\xe2\u20ac\u2122s been with many people, and her father doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want to know. He just doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t need to know. <br/>Elizabeth presses Molly about whether she loves her or \xe2\u20ac\u0153Benjamin\xe2\u20ac\x9d. She won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t say. <br/>Elizabeth: Go tell your father you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re going away with me.<br/>Molly rises to go downstairs. Elizabeth asks if she\xe2\u20ac\u2122s going to tell him she\xe2\u20ac\u2122s running away with Benjamin or Elizabeth.<br/>Molly: I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know. <br/>Molly leaves the room.<br/><br/>Elizabeth believes Molly likes her as Benjamin Smith than as Elizabeth Rutherford. She wonders if she can trust her. She can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t trust James Fawcett and probably not Molly any more. And while the part of her who is Benjamin Smith really loves Molly, Elizabeth Rutherford is angry and jealous of that little whore. She wants the vicar for herself.<br/>**Fade to black. Roll credits**<br/><br/>This was Benjamin/Elizabeth\xe2\u20ac\u2122s spotlight episode. If the series is picked up, I look forward to James Fawcett and Reverend Foote\xe2\u20ac\u2122s spotlight episodes. <br/><br/>I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t mention our issues in the beginning. This show was all about duality. James Fawcett\xe2\u20ac\u2122s issue was \xe2\u20ac\u0153playing both sides\xe2\u20ac\x9d. Rev. Foote\xe2\u20ac\u2122s was \xe2\u20ac\u0153divided loyalty\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and Benjamin/Elizabeth\xe2\u20ac\u2122s was \xe2\u20ac\u0153getting lost in her double identity\xe2\u20ac\x9d. Terrible, terrible things could potentially happen to these characters. Tonight Meg and I speculated about what could happen. The Fawcett\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Inn has an underground tunnel that leads to the Rutherford manor. What if James Fawcett and Lady Rutherford had a thing? What if James Fawcett is Elizabeth\xe2\u20ac\u2122s real father? What\xe2\u20ac\u2122s up with the vicar who likes to drink scotch with cross-dressing highwaymen and fucks landlord\xe2\u20ac\u2122s daughters? And Benjamin/Elizabeth (\xe2\u20ac\u0153I kill 4 $$\xe2\u20ac\x9d) is just itching to go on a murderous rampage, or at the very least, teach someone a lesson. Will she decide to live as Benjamin for good, or give up her very profitable career of thievery and murder? Of course, you can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really predict what might happen in PTA. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s part of the joy of it.<br/><br/>Emily, the other member in our regular group, who\xe2\u20ac\u2122s been in Seattle for the past week, wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t with us this week. We haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t played all together in over a month. It was late when we started. We really took a chance playing something so fun, knowing we might not get another session of it for a while. It was worth it. <br/><br/>We made a unanimous observation that PTA is a guaranteed good time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The conflicts happened naturally. <br/>Let's see where the conflicts were...<br/>In the flashback of the ambush there was <i>do the law men shoot Benjamin or just beat the crap out of him?</i><br/>When James Fawcett tells Molly that Ben is to be hanged, there was<i> does Mr. Fawcett notice the ring on her left hand?</i> (I can't remember if Ben and Molly were actually married, but they'd never comsummated their relationship. Maybe they got to second base.) <br/>When the Vicar goes to fetch Lady Rutherford on Ben/Liz's behalf there was <i>does Lady Rutherford go with him or refuse in order to protect Liz's identity</i> (I think)<br/>There was an awesome conflict between James Fawcett and Benjamin Smith. <i>Does Fawcett give his blessing to a Benjamin Smith-Molly Fawcett union, or does Mr. Fawcett extort more money from Ben Smith? </i><br/><br/>I might have missed one. We  definitely didn't have a conflict in every scene, and that was fine. We didn't fish for them.<br/><br/>Anyway, at some point Joshua had to remind us to throw the fan mail, but once we did we were on a roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105125/#Comment_105125" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T09:54:34+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  9:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the poem you've used for inspiration.
