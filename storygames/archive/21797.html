                            Some very low-level tips from me...<br/><br/>Assume people are terrible at keeping track of their own appointments, thus, try and make it super-simple for them to remember. Either make it a weekly appointment and it's always on the same day of the week, or a monthly appointment and it's always on the 1st [weekday] of the month - don't try anything complicated like fortnightly. Never miss a date if you can help it (if you have a co-organizer you can, of course, alternate).<br/><br/>Communicate very clearly about time - what time are people expected to show up? Be a stickler for that when you organize, then be a bit flexible about that when at the venue. Never, ever be late yourself - but definitely wait 15+ minutes while making small talk before you actually start playing, to give more people a chance to join in. Do account for this extra waiting time when calculating what time you'll be leaving the venue. Tell people the estimated ending time, but state very clearly upfront this is an estimate, not a hard limit, so they might have to flexible about leaving the venue.<br/><br/>Try to get a few friends to commit to showing up, date by date. Additionally, ask them to get more friends involved, <i>plus</i> put up a sign or something to signal everybody's welcome. Assume not all those who say they'll show up are actually going to.<br/><br/>If you have any scheduling tool you can use for people to sign up in advance, do use it - but do not ever trust it completely. People will fail to show up. Hopefully, people will occasionally show up with an extra friend or three (ideally, you want to be really happy when this happens, not feel like you have to reject people).<br/><br/>Have a "main item" game scheduled, so that if everybody shows up according to plan there's no question as to <i>what</i> you'll play. Most games do offer <i>some</i> flexibility in number of players, but always, always have backup plans (i.e. a few other games) for playing with significantly fewer people as well as with more people than expected. Splitting the group only works if there's another facilitator other than you.<br/><br/>As an extra backup plan, especially on the first few dates, bring a 2-player game - so that even if just one friend shows up at all, you'll have a good time anyway.                        </div>

                            I'm so excited for you! And I've got so much random advice!<br/><br/>It seems really basic, but <b>name stands and introductions each time</b>! Have people write their names on folded index cards at the beginning of the meet-up. It's a nice easy activity for everyone to do to get more comfortable as you start chatting while waiting for everyone to arrive, and it means we get to learn each others' names and make each other feel more welcome. <br/><br/><b>Give the safety talk every time!</b> And explain story games, how to have a good time, and all that. Related: never point out when there's only one new person.<br/><br/>My typical talk goes like this: introductions, what are these games, our responsibilities (contribute, listen), safety (x-card).<br/><br/>Give the impression that you're a bunch of strangers meeting up to play games. I know it sounds weird, but if you're there with friends, treat them no differently than the other people who show up. <b>Your main job as host is to make everyone feel comfortable and safe</b>, and one of the most uncomfortable things is feeling like you're an outsider coming into an established clique. <br/><br/>Split up into <b>small groups</b> when you can, so everyone can participate more. 3-4 people/group is ideal.<br/><br/>Once you get a nice sized group coming,<b> encourage others to facilitate games</b>. A little encouragement from the host goes a long way to give people the confidence to step up. And it gives you a break from facilitating every time <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>If you're using the Meetup website, <b>encourage people to RSVP</b>. People are more likely to want to come if they see others are RSVP'ed. <br/><br/><b>No multi-session games</b>!<br/><br/>Find a venue that's quiet. Ask them to save you a couple tables. If you are at a eatery place, you should buy something every time. Get a good relationship with the owner/staff.<br/><br/>Best of luck!<br/><br/> </div>

                            Caroline ran events at Story Games Seattle for yeaaaaars. That's veteran voice talking. She knows what's up.<br/><br/>There's tons to say, but one thing that I'd emphasize is that, like Caroline said, getting a good venue is critical and often the hardest thing. It really needs to be a good partnership, where the space works for you and your presence is a boon to the owners of the space. Keep up good lines of communication to head off problems, show that you're adults, and avoid problems or misunderstandings. You need them on your side.<br/><br/>The two classic avenues are coffee shops versus gaming/comic stores. Coffee shops are lovely but usually (and reasonably) expect people to buy stuff, like Caroline said, which may deter people on a budget. Gaming/comic stores may draw more drop-ins (aka people who don't come from meetup but just see the event in the store), but -- mincing no words -- they have perennial problems attracting people with all the negative stereotypes of gamer-dom. You have to be extra vigilant.<br/><br/>And always be keeping an eye out for new venues, even when you have a good one.<br/>

I actually go the other way, and never set a game ahead of time. The people in the room decide, which reinforces that the people that show up are the ones whose voices count. You also avoid people skipping a particular event because they are not interested in the game you list. Maybe that's better, maybe that's worse, but that's how we always did it at Story Games Seattle.<br/><br/>Overall, it helps to think of the whole process of as two separate phases: one is getting people to show up, two is getting them have enough fun that they come back. Even if you do great at one, you fail if you whiff the other.<br/><br/>A few more things to check out:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Story-Games-Seattle/messages/boards/thread/34448672" rel="nofollow">Story Games Seattle FAQ</a><br/><br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/218/our-ground-is-level-and-our-table-is-round/" rel="nofollow">Our Ground is Level and Our Table is Round</a><br/><br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/174/here-to-game/" rel="nofollow">We Are Here to Game</a> </div>

                            Another thing that helps boost attendance: documenting what happened.<br/><br/>Lots of groups talk up a coming event but then say nothing after the fact, so if you didn't go you have no idea what you missed. It's just a mystery. But if you post a few pictures, list the games that actually got played and how many people showed up (and even write whole game summaries, like we used to do at Story Games Seattle all the time) you show the people who didn't go what they were missing, which makes them more likely to come next time.<br/><br/>It's pretty simple but I cannot recommend it enough. Exploit that FOMO for good!                        </div>

                            That last point is excellent; I can attest to that.<br/><br/>Another thing I've seen gaming meetups or groups do which seems like a great way to attract people:<br/><br/>* Host low-commitment, lots-of-things-happening events.<br/><br/>For instance, a local Meetup here had a day of "game demos", where a bunch of people showed up and presented 1-hr versions of scenarios they were preparing for cons, and participated in each other's.<br/><br/>I've also seen "gaming for beginners" sessions (e.g. "come play your first D&amp;D adventure with other beginners"), mini-conventions (a few games running at the same time in a space), and mutual playtesting sessions that are open to non-designers to come participate in.                        </div>
