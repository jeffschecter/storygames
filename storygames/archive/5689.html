My group started out agreeing that Agents had to find an access point (telephone) to communicate with Control, but that soon turned out to be cumbersome. We settled on earpieces, ala Matrix.<br/><br/>How do you do it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127240/#Comment_127240" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T04:09:09+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  4:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Same way.

Well, it's not specified as earpieces: you just hear the voice of Control and can speak back to him.<br/><br/>Although sometimes the Agents will enter a room and there'll be an old-fashioned telephone ringing, with Control on the other end.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127241/#Comment_127241" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T04:12:23+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  4:12AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            from Agents to Control: get a cell-phone from Control (roll!), or find a regular phone (plenty of pay-phones around on street-corners)<br/><br/>from Control to Agents: a phone will ring, somewhere close (and there\\'s always a phone somewhere close in Blue City)<br/><br/>this really wasn\\'t a problem in the one game I ran                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127246/#Comment_127246" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T05:00:47+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  5:00AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the first several missions, the agent only communicated with Control via a landline phone.<br/><br/>In the last mission (run last Wed), Control was an older fellow and he was pretty chatty.  It was the PCs first mission as team lead, so Control was on him most of the mission, giving tidbits, advice, making sardonic comments, asking him if he wanted to eject.  It was different for the player, for sure.  He ejected at 3 Static, so I think it influenced his fear level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127268/#Comment_127268" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T08:17:32+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  8:17AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2008 8:18AM by Johnstone.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went with the fiction in the book.<br/><br/>You need a telephone or similar device to hear Control talking to you.
