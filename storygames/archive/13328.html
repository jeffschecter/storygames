I'll probably mentally wander off the subject after a while, and even if I don't, I'd have to get the okay of most of the players before doing it. Also, yes, you get to keep the neat spells you've made).<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been running a heavily modified game of Microlite20 (D&amp;D; 3.5 stripped down to the bare bones, in case you don' t know) for a couple of years now, on and off. I stumbled on Red Box Hack ages back, and loved it, but the implied setting didn't mesh with what I wanted from a fantasy game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, last week, I found Old School Hack. It takes all the stuff from RBH that I like, and makes it the more generic fantasy that I like, and does so many things that I've been trying to get my modified M20 game to do. I would probably convert the campaign to OSH in a shot, except for a couple of little issues, which is what I'd like to discuss with you folks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Issue 1: Limited Advancement</b><br/>\nLike RBH before it, OSH limits a characters power. While it isn't <i>explicit</i>, the fact that the class sheets only list level titles up to 4th level, and the rapid power advancement you get from the ability score and talent advancements means that I imagine it would get a little wonky past level 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been running my current game for a while, and would hope to run it for a while longer if I transferred to OSH, so this won't really work for me. Thus, I'm thinking that maybe rather than one talent and +1 to a score every level, make it one talent per odd level, and +1 to a score on every level devisable by 3 (so a 12th level character with this house rule would have the same stat boosts, and a few more talents, than a level 4 character in the rules as written).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Issue 2: Niche Protection</b><br/>\nI do rather like how OSH says that only one player may play a given class in a given game. It's nice niche protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have 14 players, who cycle through my game in a sort of Western Marches fashion. Niche protection is just untenable for me, so I would have to remove that limitation, and by extension, the rule that states you must ask a player permission if you want a talent from the class he's playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween this, and the possible solution for the limited advancement problem, obviously I'd have to supply a larger range of talents for each class, but I don't think that's going to be hard. However, I'm not sure whether these changes might adversely effect the play experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Semi-Issue 3: Riding around in a clockwork robot</b><br/>\nThere's a gnome wizard in my game that bought a clockwork robot and rides around in it. Thus far, it's doesn't seem to have been unbalanced in the M20 game, due to careful handling by me and GM. However, I'm not sure how to handle a character in OSH whose main schtick is the fact that he has a rather powerful servant to do his bidding.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts, folks?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
