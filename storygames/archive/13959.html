But someone who is skipping out every couple weeks is probably not right for this group.<br/><br/>Consideration.<br/>Remember childhood sandbox rules, the ones you were supposed to follow? Be nice, share, don't kick sand in other's faces. Gaming is best when everyone's helping everyone have a good time.<br/><br/>Communication.<br/>Be interested and excited to participate in email threads and wiki updates for the campaign.<br/><br/>Creativity.<br/>Have ideas! Dont just be 'I like to play everything.  Bring something to the table. Co-create and "believe" in the game fun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most likely some people will be invited to some one off events  (original D&amp;D Red Box, Supers, etc...) and we can figure out who fits and who doesn't.  The goal is to develop the best group dynamics possible, so a couple of sessions might be necessary.  Once that is determined, we can plan a campaign.<br/><br/>Also, be open minded.  If a game/campaign just isn't working, be open to allowing it to change and try something new.  The goal is to have a long lasting fun, but sticking with a sub-par game to maintain longevity is not fun.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>CAMPAIGN IDEAS?<br/>We have so many!!  But on the top of the list (in brief) are:<br/><br/>-  Vampire the Dark Ages  (Storyteller system)<br/>-  White Wolf Modern Nights: Vampire, Werewolf, or Mage <br/>-  Geist the Sin-Eaters  (Storyteller system)<br/>-  Magic the Gathering (using Pathfinder rules)<br/>-  Ars Magica  (Ars 4th-5th system)<br/>-  Fading Suns  (system?)<br/>-  Hellboy or Buffy  (Buffy Uni-system)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Contact me for more thoughts.<br/>kevperrine @ yahoo.com<br/><br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
