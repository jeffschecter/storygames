Especially since I know a lot of people are still waiting for some sign of Empire of Dust being properly released.  Basically, I\u2019m closing KNRPG Productions and creating a new imprint from its ashes.  All of our games (The Bizenghast Adventure Game, Roanoke, Urchin, Don\u2019t Walk in Winter Wood) will be going temporarily out of print.  At this point the plan is to scrub them up a bit (incorporate some errata, etc . . .) and eventually re-release them under the new imprint.<br/><br/><b>What the heck is going on with Empire of Dust?</b><br/>Empire of Dust did suffer from a few production-related problems, but all of those are resolved now.  The bigger issue was just that I personally dropped the ball on the game\u2019s release.  I had to concentrate on my personal life for a little while and I had sort of a weird existential crisis where I pretty much lost confidence and fell off the horse.  Everything\u2019s fine now, but it\u2019s still going to take a little while to get my ducks back into a row.   <br/><br/>So, the plan for Empire of Dust is this:  I have a very small number of copies on hand that I\u2019m planning to sell off to people who have already asked for them through email.  I anticipate them selling out right away, but if they don\u2019t I\u2019ll make sure to throw up a quick post here for interested parties.  After that, I\u2019ll be fully releasing the game under the new imprint.  Of course, it will be a little while before the new imprint is ready to go.  So, unfortunately more waiting is in order.<br/><br/>I\u2019ll post up more information about the new imprint when we\u2019re closer to launch.  We\u2019ve got a bunch of cool new stuff in the works.  It\u2019s going to be sweet.<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone who\u2019s supported KNRPG so far and please accept my sincere apologies for making things so difficult with Empire of Dust.<br/><br/>If you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to drop me a line at  _xolis_ <a href="/forums/profile/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197244/#Comment_197244" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T14:47:28+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  2:47PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am very glad to hear this.
