                    Imaging you're creating a dungeon for three to six players/characters. It's one that could be played many times by different groups. You need to populate it. It's sort of a sandboxy-railroad. Is it fair to say, in room A, there is one skeleton per player, in room B, there are two zombies per player, etc.  Is setting up the number of monsters based on the size of the group a fair way to populate the dungeon, or is it kind of sketchy?<br/><br/>As opposed to saying their are five and only five skeletons in room A OR there are 1d6+2 skeletons in room A, etc.                  </div>

                            Depends on the preferred group philosophy. If it's meant to be used for different groups and can't tell in advance how many PCs will play, the balanced play-story first philosophy demands adjustment to the amount of PCs, while old school demands that you stick to the 1d6+2. In each case, the opposite will feel sketchy/unfair/railroady/quantum-ogre like, etc.<br/><br/>Just make the fiction philosophy clear from the start of the game and either choice would be fine.                        </div>

                            What are those monsters for? If they exist to give "fair fights", then modern D&amp;D attempts to give you complex tools for calculating how much of a given monster is a good amount for a given party.<br/><br/>If the fights are rigged and the purpose of the monsters is dramaturgical, then I'd encourage thinking in thematic terms, with rising action and climaxes and stuff. First you encounter one of a given sort, for example, to introduce the concept; then you encounter several at once to escalate the danger. Then you meet a super-version to astound them. That sort of thing.                        </div>

                            I disagree with the last couple posts (agree with Eero amd WarriorMonk). I think it's fair to design (even an "old school") dungeon in that way, especially if it's for an open table-style setup. Otherwise smaller groups may be penalized just because they have a smaller group.<br/><br/>You could consider a scheme like this, which I've used before:<br/>- solitary/pair (hard, rare beasties)<br/>- a few such-and-suches (equals roughly half the number of players)<br/>- such-and-suches (equal to no. of players)<br/>- many such-and-suches (equals roughly twice the number of players)<br/>... and so forth, if necessary.<br/><br/>(Really, that's basically just your "players times x" idea, but I like to key with plain language keywords, so e.g. "a ton of kobolds" or "a few orcs", and then have those keywords scale to the party size.)<br/><br/>You can also mix-and-match styles--some keys list a determinate number, some a number relative to the number of players, some a random expression (2d6+2 orcs or whatever), and so forth.<br/><br/>IMO, if you're interested in OSR-style play, it's most important just to 1) decide on how to determine "number appearing" in advance, independently of e.g. how hurt the characters are or of narratological concerns; 2) stick with your prep and referee evenhandedly; 3) use Reaction Rolls; and 4) use Morale Checks.                        </div>

                            Thanks everyone,<br/>Your responses made me realize that I left out some information AND you have given me some answers and questions I hadn't expected. This post especially asked some pointed questions:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Krippler" rel="nofollow">Krippler</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So what happens when the players bring henchmen, tame genies or several characters each? </p></div></blockquote>
The players use pre-gens at the start of the campaign. This is the first dungeon in a what will hopefully be a series.  The game isn't D&amp;D but rather Brickquest (a heroquest-style game with LEGO dungeons and minifigures).
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Krippler" rel="nofollow">Krippler</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Do you scale the rewards to party size too?</p></div></blockquote>
Now that you made me think about it, the answer is maybe, probably, likely. What would the disadvantages be?
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Krippler" rel="nofollow">Krippler</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>With scaling you rob the players of the ability to choose their own risks and even solutions.</p></div></blockquote>
How? Can you explain this a little more, please?<br/>I'll give a little more detail about the dungeon.  The players have a goal to achieve ("rescue the princess"), but there are alternate paths to get there, including some that lead away from the goal to another adventure entirely. So the players can be creative about achieving the goal, including not trying to achieve it at all.

I didn't know that.  I don't play modern D&amp;D (and haven't played 1E in more than 35 years). I don't know the history.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Krippler" rel="nofollow">Krippler</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If the players have inflexible strategic options (such as not being allowed to retreat and regroup) then balancing the challenge might be necessary but then you're doing something edge case.</p></div></blockquote>Well, Brickquest, which is designed for one-off dungeons, starts at the dungeon door, and since the dungeon is built from LEGO, retreating means that the session is over (although not necessarily the campaign). I said it was a sandboxy-railroad; that's because of the LEGO and prep/building time necessary. I don't have any plot planned but I do have the different dungeon sites sort of sketched out.  If the players go to all of them, or just some of them, in any order it doesn't matter.  If they do something unexpected, then I would create something different to accomodate whatever innovations they introduce. I am trying to stretch Brickquest into a campaign play game. We'll see if it works for that.

                            Does the rules system you're using for dungeon-crawling have a value-neutral, iterative resolution procedure like D&amp;D? Or, with less jargon: does the game "care" about who wins and who loses, and does it track dramatic state in some way? For what it's worth, traditional roleplaying games rely on the GM as an entire overlay on top of a value-neutral rules system, so if that's what Brickquest gives you, at least we know what we're working with.<br/><br/>From the sound of the game I'd say that using encounter budget logic similar to modern D&amp;D (3rd to 5th editions) is the way to go if the game's value-neutral like that: by balancing the dungeon against the party that's going to face it you minimize the amount of fudging or such that the GM needs to do: the dungeon's already balanced with party success in mind, so most of the time the dungeon content will not be too much for them.<br/><br/>Of course, if Brickquest doesn't have ready-made budgeting, you'll need to do it old school (not in the jargon sense), the way GMs traditionally do it in games that don't have rules for encounter balancing: know the system, know the party, start the campaign by carefully testing what they can take, and develop your own sense of what number of skeletons is the precise right number for an exciting fight.<br/><br/>I'm running 4th edition D&amp;D myself with what sounds to me like similar creative goals. I get the "dungeon stocking" (encounter stocking, rather, in that game) from a clear procedure that the game has, it's got this scaling edifice that lets me know exactly how many 1st level goblins are an appropriate challenge for three 3rd level characters, or whatever. This system in turn helps me gauge how many goblins to use for an easy or normal or desperate fight, which can be used to pace drama. The system is obviously not fool-proof, it's not intended to somehow predict how a combat encounter will go, but it's solid enough that I don't need to be surprised by the outcomes most of the time. When I am, I have backup plans - what to do if the heroes lose a fight. (The alternate - perhaps simpler - approach is to ensure that the heroes never lose. Fundamentally it's no different.)<br/><br/>In sum: assuming that the game doesn't give you any encounter balancing suggestions, I'd recommend stocking the first dungeon as an easy dry run sort of thing; just enough danger to see how much trouble the heroes have, but not so much that you have any doubt about their survival. This then puts you into position to tone the challenge up or down in the future, depending on what the campaign requires. Over time you'll only grow better about guessing what the party can take.                        </div>

                            It's a value-neutral, iterative procedure, with no budgeting system, and no system to track dramatic states (just the BrickMaster). What you're suggesting is what I have been doing so far. I'm not sure I've chosen the best strategy. I definitely want to encode what I've been doing/expand the rules.  This is meant to be a princess-play game (if I understand your original definition of that).                        </div>

                            This could be an useless insight without the attendant skill set, but anyway: my own experience regarding railroaded princess play fantasy adventure is that the constant wargamey skirmish combat that rpg history provides us as a primary content paradigm is, ultimately, relatively simple to run around if you genuinely want to do that. It's not utterly trivial, but you can get to a point where it's less important to achieve an ideal encounter balance and more important to achieve punchy storytelling content.<br/><br/>What this observation means is that it may be the case that the one and only good reason for putting any monster or treasure into the dungeon is that it is artistically interesting for the GM as a storyteller and character therapist (in the sense of being a dialogue partner who tries to get the princesses to shine) to do so. How many skeletons? However many it takes for it to have artistic worth. How many do you need to do an atmospheric skeleton scene? How many do you need to show off this quirk of skeleton sociology in this setting? How many do you need for this player character to get to use their multiple-enemies-slaying-technique? How many so the process doesn't choke on them? That's how many skeletons you put there.<br/><br/>And then, when the naïve rules system inevitably throws you a non-constructive peril situation, so that the heroes are in danger of being buried under all those skeletons: you write yourself out of that just like an adventure story author would. Like so:<br/><b>*</b> An inner strength emerges! One of the heroes undergoes personal growth in a crisis situation and saves everybody against all odds.<br/><b>*</b> Cavalry arrives! Foreshadowed or not, the world is full of other folks who can help the heroes out of a pinch.<br/><b>*</b> The heroes lose (temporarily)! They get captured, and then escape, and then continue on their merry way.<br/><br/>So what you do is, you learn your rules system well enough to figure out how to execute any of those storytelling gimmicks in a sensible way, so you don't need to suddenly start skipping combat rounds or the like to make it work mechanically. You also avoid falling into the trap of pretending to the players that the game has some sort of a loss condition: the GM absolutely has to buy into the idea that it's not a failure if there are, after all, too many skeletons. If the GM thinks that they've made a mistake, or the other players have made a mistake, and the heroes should never, ever get overwhelmed by the bones, then any gimmick from the above list will have the taste of gild to it. So avoid that by internalizing the idea that win or lose, it's an exciting twist either way.<br/><br/>If you're willing to run around the win/loss theatrics attendant to traditional fantasy adventure roleplaying, the dungeon stocking issue becomes much simpler: you don't need to be quite so paranoid about accidentally causing the dreaded Total Party Kill, which means that you can play closer to the brink. As this is what good adventure storytelling does anyway (heroes are always meeting harsh odds), it should only improve the excitement.                        </div>

                            Stuff like having the game proceed differently depending on whether you're at the beginning or end of a storyline. A traditional roleplaying game handles this stuff by having a value-neutral rules system that merely resolves atomic actions uniformly, no matter the context: a sword-stroke is a sword stroke as far as D&amp;D is concerned, no matter its importance to the story. Trad rpg design assumes that the rules system is immaculately value-neutral while the GM is a comprehensive black box translator between the resolution system and the players, choosing when and how the system gets applied: he ensures, by hook or by crook, that the final sword stroke required by the story gets to happen in a satisfying way.<br/><br/>The opposite of this type of game design philosophy would be one where the game "tracks dramatic state" and therefore "knows" something mechanically about the story. For example, many drama games know which fictional actors are central and which are merely support (because the players assign these for the game, of course), and resolves their actions differently based on that. Theme tracking, storyline tracking, assigning levels of importance (and resolution detail) to events, those are all examples of common ways that a game can be dramatically aware. Taken as a whole, it is actually a really notable feature of the traditional rpg how it simultaneously preaches the importance of story while being mechanically ostensibly drama-neutral: the GM is left with a very important creative role there.                        </div>

                            In my heart of hearts, I like a dungeon to make strangely logical sense.  I appreciate when it has an ecology, and a history, however brief.  I realize this is oftentimes hard.  <br/><br/>Give me a reason, and I'll overlook most mechanical(game design) bullshit.  <br/>Give me a good story reason, a pièce de résistance and I'll overlook any mechanical failures of the game, or luck, or whatever.                        </div>

                            First I'd figure out what the dungeon originally was and why it was abandoned and then I'd think of 1 or 2 things that have squatted in it through the years/ages leading up to its current monster-infested state and go from there.                        </div>
