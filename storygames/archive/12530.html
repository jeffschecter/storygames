I know that the game is advertised as for three to six players, but we tried it and ran into two rather large problems for playing with two.<br/><br/>The end game occurs when the last of the second batch of civilians dies. This has a fifty fifty chance of occurring during round three. Meaning, we might only have two clue gathering rounds to indict.<br/><br/>Which leads us to our second major problem, clue gathering. With only one of us rolling and providing clues on any particular round, we don't gather a lot of clues. Mathematically, the odds become extremely poor with only one person rolling per round.<br/><br/>What we did was one of us created another civilian, and we played another round (doing a tribute and two civilian vignettes), then the killer struck again, we made yet another civilian, and then the next time the killer struck, we went for an indictment. Giving us a grand total of 4 civilians, of which three died before we went for an indictment (four if you count the jane doe at the beginning). <br/><br/>It was slightly bizarre though, and it gave less screen time to the civilians before they died, giving us less time to grow to like them.<br/><br/>The mathematical problem was even worse. With only one of us rolling dice after every murder, and not rolling all that well, we had a total of 6 clues when we went for the indictment (surprisingly, we split the clues 2 2 1 1, and our four dice came up 1 2 3 3, meaning we still almost got our indictment). However, even if we had rolled average during the clue gathering phases, it still would only have been 10 clues. And it also means you never really get to sweat about going for an indictment even if it might fail, against possibly saving the lives of these characters you like, because mathematically, you have to go all the way if you hope for an indictment.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any ideas for how to get past these obstacles?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281493/#Comment_281493" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T15:25:57+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  3:25PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.  At first I thought.... That's odd.  The game is a linear scale.  Shouldn't it all work out?  But then I realized that there's a disproportionate increase between killer difficulty and number of clues.<br/><br/>So in a two player game.  You have to have 3 successful chains with 2.5 clues per round.  That will take you 3.6 rounds to get 3 chains with 3 clues.  The actual probability is probably more complicated that "feels" like the 50% chance of success mark.<br/><br/>In a three player game you have to have 4 successful chains with 5 clues per round.  So it will only take you 2.4 rounds to get to 4 chains with 3 clues.  That's a significant improvement.<br/><br/>In a four player game you have to have 5 chains with 7.5 clues per round.  That's only 2 rounds to hit 5 chains with 3 clues.<br/><br/>For five players that's 6 chains and 10 clues per round.  Only 1.8 rounds to hit 6 chains with 3 clues.<br/><br/>In a six player game that's 7 chains and 12.5 clues per round. Only 1.68 rounds.  <br/><br/>So as you get more players, you're hitting the 50% success mark, sooner and sooner.  So....  Averaging them out that's 1.97 rounds to hit 50% success chance.<br/><br/>So to hit that average in a two player game you want 9 clues in 1.97 rounds.  Which is 4.6 clues per round.  Which means your single detective needs to roll about 9 dice per round instead of 5.<br/><br/>So that's what I'd do.  Just have the one player roll 9 or 10 dice instead of 5 in each round.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281507/#Comment_281507" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T16:51:21+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  4:51PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>So in a two player game.

Even three chains of five each is only a 58% chance of a successful indictment. Of course, the best odds will involve three chains of a decent height, and then a few chains of one as well, giving you extra dice For example, three chains of three and six chains of one gives a 92% indictment rate, even though this is the same number of clues as three chains of five.<br/><br/>All this to say that yes, bumping the number of dice is one potential method. Another, that I've thought of, is to have the both players roll dice. Although since you didn't suggest that Jesse, I'm wondering if the fact that one player doesn't roll dice is vital. I mean, it didn't feel like it to me when I played, but I'm perfectly willing to admit that I might have missed something.<br/><br/><b>ASIDE</b>: I think that chain manipulation in order to increase one's odds of indictment is probably the wrong way to go when playing the game. I want my chains of clues to lead me to being able to imagine who the killer is, and I suspect that a bunch of disconnected shallow chains just there to increase my odds of indictment will not help me "see" the killer in my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20S.%20Miller" title="Michael S.

During the investigation meeting, have one of you play the Cheif Investigator, and the other roll &amp; provide clues. Then switch. Then move on to the indictment or next round of civilian scenes.<br/><br/>As for not getting to know the civilians very well, I'd suggest you do two civilian scenes per round. The main reason for the "one civilian scene per round" structure is to keep things moving at a brisk pace with larger groups. With only two players, I can't imagine that time would become a pressing issue.<br/><br/>Any other elegant solutions that we've overlooked?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284001/#Comment_284001" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T12:00:20+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 12:00PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we tried again, this time using two civilians each instead of one, and having both of us roll during the Investigation phase.<br/><br/>We love the Investigation phase, so having both of us contribute clues during each of them was awesome.<br/><br/>However, four civilian scenes with just two heads is a bit much. We didn't feel any closer to the civilians, and quite frankly, it felt at times we were stretching for material. We did come up with an alternative way of performing the procedures, though, that would keep us with only two civilians each, but which should give us more turns. A die roll. Evens, there was either no murder or it was another Jane Doe (but we still get an Investigation phase if there was no murder), odds, the envelope, please. The logic being that the police are recombing the evidence even if there have been no new murders, looking for a clue.<br/><br/>We plan on giving that a try next time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20S.%20Miller" title="Michael S.

It keeps the pressure on, because eventually that die is going to come up odd, but it introduces the hope of the civilian surviving another round by the arbitrary influence of fate. I normally don't allow the killer to appear in the civilian scenes at all, but here's a thought:<br/><br/>On scenes where the die came up even, start the civilian scene with an abrupt and unexpected change of plans. So, the civilian had a flat tire (or something) on their way to confront whatever obstacle they're up against, and is late getting there. This shows how the killer was ready to get the civilian, had they followed their routine, but dumb luck intervened.<br/><br/>Just a thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
