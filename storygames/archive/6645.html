Reed answers that logically yes (essentially enough knowledge and power, what can be done can be undone etc.), "Yet I posit we are in a universe which favours stories.  A universe in which no story can ever truly end; in which there can only be continuances.... the laws of story suggest no cure can last for very long .... in the end, alas, you are so much more interesting and satisfying as you are."<br/><br/>All characters in fiction live in a universe in which "the Laws of Story" rule, though those laws vary (e.g., by genre), but generally under the "invisible hand" of story by which they do not know this.<br/><br/>Would it be "more believable" in a way for the characters in a RPG (player and NPC) to know "the Laws of Story" exist?  To struggle to make it a drama and love story rather than a tragedy but know it is a story?  To know that dramatic logic is at work?  Thus the appearance of a nemesis, the significance of metaphor etc. all flow quite logically?<br/><br/>In PTA, characters don't know this but there is an overt nod at Player level to this fact.<br/><br/>I've sort of hinted at this in my games for a long time, in the view that "story" is a fundamental human desire and need and that collective human unconsciousness shapes things in this way in a universe where magical force responds to it.<br/><br/>C.S. Friedman's Coldfire Triology has humans settled on a world where such forces were powerfully at work, one character realizing the only "course open to him" was to make himself "the epic villain".<br/><br/>In 4e D&amp;D for example, the Player Characters are "special", the heal wounds overnight, why?  Because the Story is interested in them, they are not going to die except in an "interesting way".  As long as they "are interesting and their story incomplete" they can return from death.<br/><br/>Do you think this can be handled with a relatively serious tone?<br/><br/>Rob                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147382/#Comment_147382" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T15:44:41+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  3:44PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm working on a game called <i>Mr. Earbrass Writes a Novel</i> in which an author is writing a novel and the characters become aware, in some manner, that they are being written about.  It's still in conceptual stages, but the idea is that they realize that the more complicated and interesting (from a story point of view) things become, the more the author is satisfied.  When the author is unsatisfied, he begins <b>Revising</b>, and no one wants that, because it's always going to make things even worse.  So, they have to sorta play along, making things "interesting" enough that the author won't revise them, but not so "interesting" that they can't live with it.  Which ends up being an impossible goal as struggles and conflicts between the characters are highlighted and pressured and blown up by this whole predicament.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see it as serious, with humor.

Reed is a super-genius, so it's just awesome that he has such a theory. If Indiana Jones has a theory that hinted he knew he was in a movie, it probably wouldn't read as well. Although we see the opposite a lot as a joke, the old clam "Hey, this is the real world!" - I'm also thinking that being cognizant of being in a fiction based reality is something along the same lines. It's a nice joke (or fan service, if you want to call it that) but it usually doesn't have a dramatic impact (unless you count Reed's decision <i>not</i> to spend time on a cure for Grimm a dramatic change).<br/><br/>Although in TORG, some Cosm laws had rules such as this, and they were known laws of reality (at least by some). IIRC, Nile Empire (the pulp reality mixed with Egyptian occultism) had such a law, even called "Law of Drama". <br/><br/>But I think it can be handled seriously.  Although like most things, they tend to start off as comedy as we test the limits of our new boundries, I don't see any reason it need stay silly.  It would largely depend on the scope of the knowledge (limited to a select few, that may or may not include all the PCs, is a good start) and what effects it has in-game and in-story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148137/#Comment_148137" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T14:02:28+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  2:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For another fictional example of the Laws of Story being consciously referenced by the characters, look no further than Terry Pratchett's <i>Witches Abroad</i>.

There are plenty of other games that give bonuses for "cool," which is essentially applying Laws of Drama to the Laws of Physics. Even if the players don't sit around having in-character discussion about it, their characters' behaviors are certainly influenced by this knowledge.

His avatar was his player (Who wasn't actually me. The avatar was a stereotypical gamer based on a friend of ours.). This was assisted by the fact that White Wolf wrote an evil counterpart to themselves into the WoD in the form of Black Dog Games who made evil versions of the WoD games. <br/>The main problem was that the character preferred D&amp;D and didn't actually understand what game he was in. <br/><br/>Anyway, I think it's sometimes, if not always, interesting to have characters in a game world react as though: <br/>1. Game physics are the laws of physics of their world. (There's no reason your 20th level fighter should beat hell out of the mage for dropping a fireball on you most of the time. It might cook peasants, but you're made of sterner stuff.)<br/><br/>2. Recognize that they are being driven by the laws of story if they are in a specific place where the laws of story clearly override "reality" or if the world being depicted actually follows the laws of story. For example, princes in fairy tales are almost always good and handsome. Everyone in the world believes that. It's not that it's a "Law of Drama," just that the world already conforms to specific tropes and everyone within that world accepts it. <br/>In order to have characters consciously react to laws of story, you'd have to take them out of the world that they normally act in, such that, say, Super-heroes sucked into a fairy-tale realm, could react based on fairytale tropes because they recognize the tropes rather than being bound within those tropes as "real-life."<br/><br/>Damn, did that make any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jvstin" title="Jvstin"><img alt="Jvstin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jvstin">Jvstin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148299/#Comment_148299" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T05:35:10+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  5:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup.
