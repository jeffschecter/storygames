It would be fantastic if you could text message a number to subscribe to specific updates. Text messaging is great because most phones can do it. But it also costs money.<br/><br/>&gt; Twitter<br/><br/>Twitter with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23hashtags&amp;Mode=like">#hashtags</a> works well. Not all phones have twitter. But it's incredibly easy to use. <br/><br/>&gt; Posterous<br/><br/>Posterous.com could be used to updated a shared blog. People could email, text message, or tweet game updates to Posterous and it would post everything to 1 place for easy access. The downside is you have to have a phone with a basic web browser (although nothing fancy). And you have to give game organizers permission to contribute (vs twitter where anyone can use the same #hashtag). It also has the benefit of being versatile. You could output the updates to twitter for example. <br/><br/>&gt; Wiki<br/><br/>Are there wiki's you can update via twitter or text messaging? This could work similar to Posterous above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258971/#Comment_258971" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T14:53:46+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  2:53PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If this is at Gencon, you could also put out a notice at Games on Demand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jchokey" title="jchokey"><img alt="jchokey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jchokey">jchokey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258986/#Comment_258986" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T17:09:22+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  5:09PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2010 5:09PM by jchokey.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt; Text Messaging<br/>\n&gt; Twitter<br/>\n&gt; Posterous<br/>\n&gt; Wiki<br/>\n<br/>\nThese might work for others, but I don't think any of these would be noticed by me.

When I have 5 numbers (or whatever), I'll post the names and people can whisper those people their number, and so on. If you want to run a pickup, post in this thread, same rules." So as to create a tree where you only have to text 5 people at a time, but your drawing from a known community pool.<br/><br/>Which is probably more front-end organization than you're looking for, but hey, a thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259003/#Comment_259003" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T19:32:40+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  7:32PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            coded language + secret handshake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259004/#Comment_259004" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T19:35:27+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  7:35PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Truth be told, nothing beats word of mouth.

You do want to fish for general interest, but I think a pickup game (given diffuse enough organization as-is) needs one person to say "I will do this if I get N others to jump on board".<br/><br/>So I think you want a place to broadcast "here's my idea / standing offer" and a response-channel for "ok, I'm interested". A twitter hashtag for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23genconpickup&amp;Mode=like">#genconpickup</a> could work for broadcast (and DMs or cell text messages would get back to the key person to organize). Maybe a bulletin board with index cards (and text-message contact info) to propose ideas?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259010/#Comment_259010" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T19:45:00+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  7:45PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure...

Here are the hurdles I see:<br/><br/>Variance in aptitude and technology. If the solution requires, say, twittering from your phone, a certain segment is out because they can't or don't know how.<br/><br/>Aggregation and organization. This is an interface design issue and not a crushing one, but people need to be able to parse the incoming data quickly and easily, make connections, commit, and get full sessions closed, etc.<br/><br/>Just-in-time. All this has to go down in half an hour or something - at least that seems like the model now. You aren't going to plan a few days in advance for your down time.<br/><br/>To me all these potential hurdles speak to a very low-tech solution, like a centralized physical bulletin board that serves both as information hub and meeting point. The lobby of the Embassy Suites at Gen Con serves this purpose informally - people mingle, GMs round people up, and a small cohort just stay to chat all evening while others make matches and go

I've heard of cons where people who want to get involved in a pick-up game go to a specific location, and GMs who want to start a game announce, loudly, "I'm starting &lt; insert game name here &gt;! Who wants to play?" Interested parties follow.<br/><br/>Of course, that assumes that people are capable of that kind of communication. When I'm from (Minnesota), seems like people are too afraid of communication that direct. At the local cons I've been to,  people looking for pickup games just wander aimlessly in hope of finding something. It doesn't work very well at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260002/#Comment_260002" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T05:13:57+00:00" title="March  4, 2010  5:13AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jiawen, I could definitely see that! <br/><br/>At NerdNYC's Recess event, when we have pickup games I usually will walk around for people announcing that games are open. It works well because I have a staff badge and am making general announcements anyway so people are already tuned in. It also works both ways, players will then start to come to me and ask what games are still open even when I'm not making announcements. <br/><br/>In terms of the low tech route, we can have a giant bulletin board with black forms people could fill out. 1 form for people wanting to run games and another form where people can list all the games they would like to play and the times they think they will be free. Then potential GMs could look through the lists to inform them of what games they may want to run. This way it's not all GM -&gt; Players one way communication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260342/#Comment_260342" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T17:53:16+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  5:53PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to train my fans to use twitter to watch for Burning Wheel events.
