I have two games I am interested in running but I am open to other ideas.  RSVP here.  You can also join the PhillyRoleplayers yahoo group.  Just ask me to send an invite.<br/><br/>This is the plan:<br/><b>Where:</b> 1524 S 29th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19146 (block between Dickenson &amp; Tasker on 29th)<br/><b>Parking:</b> Street parking is readily available and there is a free lot on the LEFT the next block up on 29th)<br/><b>When:</b> 10am to 5pm Saturday, May 26th - one five hour time slot<br/><br/>Food: There are several convenience stores within a few blocks distance and places to order lunch.<br/><br/>What will we play: There are a lot of options.  The first I will suggest is if you have a current campaign that you're playing bring everyone over and play here.  Change of venue and build community.  Maybe you'll get an extra player or another group together off of it.  As I mentioned I will be running one of two games - one game is a winter fantasy occupied by inuits heralding the first dawn into the world (heavy HK action theater tropes).  The second is a gritty fantasy scenario surrounding four adventurers plumming the depths of a dwarven tomb in ruins to attain an ancient sword.  If we get more than five participants then we'll add more games.  <br/><br/>This is a social meetup so I plan to have an hour on each side to allow us to get to know one another, break the ice and talk about the games we play.<br/><br/>Hope to see you there,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
