Getting characters created together is really important in BW, because otherwise you could easily end up with a really incongruous group, and suddenly you're running three seperate games.  <br/><br/>Ideally, you'll want to prep with characters' Beliefs in mind, so you can challenge them and stuff.<br/><br/>I'd also really encourage you to only use the basic rules from the book.  Don't worry about "Fight" or anything in your first session.  Just get used to the basic dice mechanic.  I played a six-session game of BW without more than the most basic mechanics, and it was fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224933/#Comment_224933" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T16:41:33+00:00" title="August 16, 2009  4:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the basic story:<br/><br/>My group has been going on and on about they want to settle down and play a proper campaign and stick to it. Of course I volunteered to be the GM (I usually am and nobody else seemed keen on the idea). So I started a 4e campaign and after the first session I realised that I really don't like GMing or prepping 4e and will have no fun doing it. So I abort the campaign and instead tell them I'm jumping to Burning Wheel. They mostly keep repeatedly telling me 'we just want to play a campaign' and I keep explaining that's what this will be.<br/><br/>I organise a character creation session and two people (out of four) don't bother coming, one just asks me to create his character, and the other two that do show up get halfway through the process (they chose lifepaths, that's all).<br/><br/>I think they're used to something a little bit more traditional and less driven by what the characters are about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224934/#Comment_224934" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T17:05:08+00:00" title="August 16, 2009  5:05PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2009 5:15PM by ccreitz.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BW won't work without buyin. Audible your campaign to something else. Your players have Flags up that they want something else, the way I read it.<br/><br/>Wicked Age is zero prep, simple rules, campaignable. I've always wanted to try it and the reviews and APs are generally quite positive. For all the animus against the White Wolf games, they have a nice, easy-to-understand reward cycle (Nature/Demeanor or Vice/Virtue), simple mechanics, likely familiarity, and many of them even have fast chargen. Use modern play techniques and you might have a great time. If you liked 3e, well, it and its indie descendents (True20, Pathfinder, E6...) are still playable. Everyone seems to like Red Box Hack, which has simple rules and is free and cool.<br/><br/>If you are seriously apprehensive about how you and your group will handle BW, don't sweat it. It's a cool game, but there are others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225070/#Comment_225070" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T09:21:16+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  9:21AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally screwed.

The concept I suggested for the campaign was a sort of... city of thieves type setup, very Lankhmar inspired. And they all made character who fit in well with that setting, although I'm honestly not sure about how they're going to work as a group even though I stressed that maybe they should. Oh and I kept saying that if they didn't really the setting or had a better idea, throw it out and everyone could discuss it and y'know maybe we could come up with something cool. And every time I said it, they basically didn't say anything. No feedback, no 'oh we like it already' or 'wouldn't it be cool if?'. That kind of bothered me. <br/><br/>Got some interesting beliefs out of the characters, one guy was an escaped P.O.W. who's all about waging a secret war against the people who captured him in the first place, another is a thief who wants to work his way to the top of the pecking order, which is pretty much the same goal as his con-man buddy (who insisted he was too tired to do the last parts of the process last night and will send me his beliefs and such today).<br/><br/>Basically they're all pretty passive about it. They expressed interest in how things work once I explained it to them, I sent them all the rules summary from the BW wiki and some of them have actually read it. But there's not the enthusiasm I was hoping for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225161/#Comment_225161" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T13:34:47+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  1:34PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Run Mouse Guard instead. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> After my first session of Mouse Guard (wooo one data point!)

So I'm pretty much just going to have to do my best to make it work and if it fails, I'll let it fail and throw something else at them.

I think all the advice about player buy-in is good, but, as you say, your group *is* committed to playing a long-term campaign, so maybe if your first couple sessions are off the hook, they will get all into it.<br/><br/>I'll second the idea that you should leave the more advanced sub-systems alone until everyone has grokked the basic dice mechanics. So I'd avoid Fight, Duel of Wits, Range and Cover, and Sorcery. (In fact, my most recent BW campaign did just that, and it went better than the previous one).<br/><br/>Circles is a pretty important rule, especially in a "city of thieves" game like yours. It's easy to use, and I think it is a good way to convey some of the cool stuff about BW without you just preachin' it. So maybe throw some stuff at the characters that would make for a good Circles test. And, since your players aren't used to the game yet, tell them what you're doing. The fun part is making the test and having the player (not the GM) explain who the NPC in question turns out to be.<br/><br/>BW handles social encounters well, even if you don't use Duel of Wits. So pick one of the players who came up with the most background, and throw them up against one of his relationships, maybe in an adversarial way, and let them use social skills to get through the encounter. They have to convince someone of something (Persuasion), make a deal (Haggling), stir a small crowd (Oratory), or something like that. Make sure to nudge them on using Wises. ("Dave, doesn't your guy have Irate City-Guard-wise? That would give you a bonus die here.")<br/><br/>Definitely make sure you DON'T have any preconceived cool plans for what will happen next from scene to scene. If you're just as surprised by the outcome of things as the players, those might be good "a-ha!" moments for them about how the game works and how they might get into a BW campaign.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225387/#Comment_225387" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T09:49:04+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  9:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2009 10:27AM by Mel_White.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi,<br/> With the information from the character building session, I have  a lot of optimism about your game.  Right away you have the makings of a fun few scenes with two player characters that want the same thing--to be at the top of the Thieves' Guild.  What's neat about this in a Lankhmaresque setting is that it's reminiscent of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser's first meeting, where I think they were plotting the same heist.  So make being named the Guildmaster's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> guy a point of the first game. The guildmaster says, 'Impress me."  At this point the players will bombard you with questions about how to impress the master and about the city itself--what is in the city to be stolen or kidnapped or freed or whatever.  This is the opportunity for the players to use -Wises to create facts about all those things.  I'm hopeful that the players will be able to each come up with a caper.  You can resolve each caper as a linked test of three or four rolls, with the most impressive thief being the one with the most successes in the various tests.   And, all is not lost even for the loser, because you could use the duel of wits as a final opportunity for both thieves to make their case to the master--giving the winner of the capers a bonus to his body of argument.  For the third character, the escaped POW, how cool would it be for him to have been imprisoned and escaped from the thieves guild itself?  The way to impress the guildmaster may be to bring back the escapee 'undamaged'.  In BW demos like 'the Sword' and 'Quest for the Holy Grail' (full disclosure--I wrote Quest for the Grail, so I like to plug it ;-), <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads#Scenarios_and_Demos" rel="nofollow">BW Downloads</a> the action is based on PC-vs-PC conflict, and the scenarios practically run themselves.  Although continual PC conflict won't contribute to the campaign game you're looking for, an initial conflict between eventual comrades is common enough in the action genre. <br/>I think the Duel of Wits is great even for players new to BW.  It allows PC-v-PC social conflict that can actually be resolved without one _player_ having to give in.  Alternately, with the PCs teamed up against an NPC it's a fun way of seeing what direction the game is going to take because the NPC's decision is not preordained.

And I completely understand and agree with it.<br/><br/>But I don't always succeed. Burning Wheel is a great example of that problem for me, since I've played it a fair amount, and have struggled some with making those games super awesome. It's really easy to set up a conflict or situation (fight, argument, attempted sneakiness, whatever), and have the charater fail, and then fall back on "Oh, you failed. Well, it didn't work out, I guess. You lose. Next thing!"<br/><br/>This is somewhat off-topic, so I'll take it to a new thread if anyone wants to comment on it. But it's something I notice about my own games, particularly where Burning Wheel is involved. Maybe because BW is so close to D&amp;D in its trappings, so it's tricker to bring the new-school gaming-fu to bear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225534/#Comment_225534" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T16:30:00+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  4:30PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Old habits die hard, Brian. :-) <br/><br/>Several things that helped me over the hump:<br/><br/>1) Paying more attention to good adventure fiction. Seriously! Read The Three Musketeers, and you'll see that D'Artagnon never actually just *fails* to do something. Rather, his story is constantly made more complex, the tension ramps up, and the story goes on. I think this has a lot to do with old gamer habits that have nothing to do with how storytelling works: we've come to treat rolls as win/lose propositions, while in stories it's rarely so clear-cut.<br/><br/>2) Be strict with yourself about negotiating complications prior to the roll. This is BW RAW, but even the BWHQ guys play fast and loose with it -- because they know what they're doing. Until you're totally comfortable with the whole "either the hero gets what he wants without complication, or his life is about to get even more complicated," absolutely, positively always prenegotiate. I find that, by doing so, it forces me to really, really focus on what any given roll or conflict is really "about." Otherwise I do what you do: oops, you fail, tough luck.<br/><br/>3) In BW at least, look to the character's traits for inspiration on good failures. If they fail because of a character trait, that helps reiterate the character and the player feels like the loss is arising from principled play. That's a tough one to explain without a whole essay. I can start a new thread if you need me to unpack it.<br/><br/>4) Say Yes if a complication doesn't immediately and obviously jump to your mind. Really! If you don't have a likely failure candidate in mind right at the beginning, it probably means it's just rolling for rollings' sake, not because there's any intrinsic tension to the moment.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
