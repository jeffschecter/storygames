For a while I've been struggling with the text of Burning Empires because many people I know would like to play it and I'd really like to give it a shot but I conceptually struggle with it.  So, I'm planning on taking a shot at Mouse Guard as kind of an "beginning" exercise.  However, when I started reading Mouse Guard I realized I was having similar (though smaller) issues that I did with Burning Empires and I finally figured out what the problem is.<br/><br/>Luke writes in a very thorough but layered style.  Burning Empires and Mouse Guard are not presented in strict procedural order.  They're presented in.... sort of ever broadening circles of related concepts.  This means that concepts are often introduced sooner than they're fully explained.  Luke often acknowledges this with phrases like, "There's this thing called X which we'll get into later but for now..."  I realize, to me, this is making these games very difficult for me to follow because I like being told HOW before WHY.<br/><br/>A good example is the scene economy in Burning Empires.  I've been told about the various scene types.  I've been told that there will be a limited number of some types of scenes.  But it's not until much, much, much later that I'm told how to calculate how many of each type.  Procedurally I would do those calculations immediately after character creation and so my brain is sort of frozen, like a computer, back at character creation awaiting the next instruction.  My mind isn't really processing what I'm reading because I "know" I've skipped a step and I'm reluctant to learn anything else until I know the details of that step.<br/><br/>Dirty Secrets works much better for me as a text because it's divided into two sections.  The first section is the procedural rules more or less in the exact order you would execute them with minimal need-to-know information to understand each step.  The second section goes into all the analysis of how to employ the rules to maximum effect.  If Luke had written this book the content of that second section would drive the overall layout of the text as a whole with the rules of the first section being revealed as concrete applications of those concepts.<br/><br/>I'm sure this is related to "learning styles" or something.  I'm just glad I've figured this out because now that I know what my problem is I might actually be able to navigate Burning Empires text successfully.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203197/#Comment_203197" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T17:10:56+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  5:10PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's a very fair assessment of the same problem a lot of folks have with parsing B* games.

Everything fell apart, then I went back through and re-read everything front-to-back. Still didn't internalize it but picked up a few more bits. It took, probably, six or seven sessions of broken, sort of unfun play before I saw how all the parts fit together.

When ever there's a sequential gap in the presentation from what I would actually be doing at the table my brain tries to "bookmark" it so I can remember "this information was incomplete" so I can linearized it later.  Only I can't remember and keep track of all the book marks.  Soon, everything seems really busy because in addition to whatever new thing I'm reading my brain is fighting, "Remember you skipped X.  Remember you need to know Y.  Remember it didn't cover Z yet.  Remember when you see N to cross-reference back to M."  And those stack up pretty fast in Burning Empires.<br/><br/>The very fact that Character Creation is at the END of Mouse Guard is bugging me.  The only reason it's not completely blowing my learning process is because I know what kind of things one *generally* does in character creation.  If I was totally new to the concept I wouldn't be able to read the text because my mind would constantly be yelling, "But where do these numbers come from?  How do we generate these numbers again?"

I can't speak for new players of RPGs, but in the beginning it does describe the whole "what is this game and how is it to be played?" thing very well. CC isn't necessary for that, as it provides sample characters from the comics, statted out, and assumes you'll start with playing them. Which I think makes a whole lot of sense to newcomers, and creating a character out of whole cloth less so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203211/#Comment_203211" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T19:25:29+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  7:25PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are non-RPGs like that, too. Some games are easier to teach than to read about, for whatever reason. I went through that with Marvel Super Heroes and Galaxy (the card game based on the old Titan: The Arena game). Like...they need to talk about certain concepts early, but if you get bogged down in the details of those concepts early then you'll just get confused because the details invoke further details. <br/><br/>I've always had good luck teaching those games by starting at the end -- this is how you win the game -- and moving backward, in steps, from there.<br/><br/>On that note...I wonder if one could write RPG procedures that way as well? Rather than building from the bottom-up, procedure upon procedure, what if you wrote it from the top-down? Like...this is what you're trying to achieve at the table in the course of play (first), here are the ways you can touch the fiction (next), and here are the various systems that inform the ways you touch the fiction (last).<br/><br/>Thinking on it, it seems like the traditional approach has been to hype up the players on the fictional promise up-front (<i>revel in the power and drama of life among the city's mighty vampire clans</i>!), then drop you straight into bottom-up procedural details. And maybe, within any given subsystem, you <i>might</i> read an example of play that's intended to illustrate a system. But I don't know that you ever get a "this is how you win the game" type thumbnail in the beginning (noting that "winning" in this case is shorthand for "achieve the intended experience at the table").<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203213/#Comment_203213" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T19:26:13+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  7:26PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I remember that.<br/><br/>I'm curious have you read Annalise?

I'm willing to trust the designer that there's a reason for his rules.  I'd rather have a cold but procedurally ordered list of rules with ZERO explanation and simply trust that the designer knew what he was doing and that I'll see it all when I try to play it, than a well explained text that's procedurally fragmented by those explanations.<br/><br/>I'm very weird in that I've NEVER had that nearly ubiquitous gamer trait of house ruling and system "monkeying" simply because I've ALWAYS had the attitude that, "if the rule wasn't important, it wouldn't be there."  Verbiage in game texts along the lines of The Golden Rule or Rule Zero has almost angered me because it's a blatant dismissal of the implicit trust I put in the design of the game.<br/><br/>I think this is why I can play the board game Android.  There's A LOT of stuff that seems "pointless" in that game upon first reading and even upon first playing.  But a game or two down the road suddenly a situation that has never happened in your previous games occurs and you're like, oh, so THAT'S why I can do that.  I'd say at least 30% of that game appears "pointless" each time you play.  It's just, it's a different 30% each time.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203307/#Comment_203307" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-23T12:02:33+00:00" title="April 23, 2009 12:02PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>"if the rule wasn't important, it wouldn't be there."</blockquote>I tend to assume this too.

If I've been told I can do something, I think about it, trying to figure out when and why I want to, and if I've been told I can do something that it seems i would never want to do, i get confused.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke" title="NoahTheDuke"><img alt="NoahTheDuke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke">NoahTheDuke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203310/#Comment_203310" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-23T12:33:08+00:00" title="April 23, 2009 12:33PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All this talk of "procedural"-ly written books makes me think of Dogs in the Vineyard, with its chapter The Structure of the Game, on pages 93-96.

It would also be a lot more work to implement in big books, but...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203446/#Comment_203446" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-24T11:06:50+00:00" title="April 24, 2009 11:06AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: greatwolf</cite>Android players represent!</blockquote>\nDing!<br/><br/>It's interesting timing for me to come across this discussion today: I <i>just</i> finished reading my PDF copy of <i>Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies</i>, which I think will be a very fun game, and the whole time I was thinking "agh, this book is laid out completely backwards! I want to know how the game works in general first, and THEN give me the list of specific Fortes and tell me how they work." It's like being told the exceptions before being told the rule.<br/><br/>Obviously this will be different for each reader, but I am definitely in the school of Bigger Concepts &gt; Smaller <br/>Concepts &gt; Exceptions.<br/><br/>When I read <i>Burning Wheel</i>, I had already been -told- how to play, and played one brief game, but I couldn't finish reading the core rulebook until I got out the character burner, read it, AND cranked out a few characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203458/#Comment_203458" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-24T12:08:13+00:00" title="April 24, 2009 12:08PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thor,<br/><br/>Character Creation in Mouse Guard was perhaps a bad example.  I realize that in MG it's sort of an advanced technique with the templates being the default/preferred method.  To the extent that I'm being nit picky I would have preferred all twelve templates (yes I realized they're pre-customized for the missions at the end) presented with the steps for customization up front.  Because procedurally, at the table, that's what you would do.<br/><br/>Step 1) Players pick from one of these twelve templates.<br/>Step 2) Do A, B and C to customize the templates.<br/><br/>But that would be nit-picky (Especially since I realize the templates are paired with starter missions which are themselves only examples).<br/><br/>Also, I'm not in anyway saying that MG or BE are "incomplete."  That would not only be a lie, it would be insulting.  These texts are some of the most rigorously written and thorough rule texts I've ever seen.  Other game writers would do well to study these texts.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the text is not presented in procedural-decision making order.  And as others have demonstrated that's a learning style thing specific to me as apparently others have no problem with it.<br/><br/>As another example how Traits can be used to affect a die roll is not presented among the rules for basic die rolling.  Similarly the options for using Nature are not presented there as well.  They are presented in their respective concepts.  But that means I have to ask myself, "What's Nature used for again?"  or "How do Traits work?"  which is likely only to happen after I've been playing for a while and realize those mechanics don't appear to have been doing anything which means I've missed out opportunities to use them.<br/><br/>That wouldn't happen if I'm looking at a section of text where I can just run my finger down the page and go, "Okay, I've picked a skill, gathered helping dice, added in a wise, AH!  That's right I can use Traits and earn checks."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203475/#Comment_203475" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-24T14:19:37+00:00" title="April 24, 2009  2:19PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Procedurally, you do pick or create a character before you play, but it can be hard to do that if you don't know what all the numbers mean.<br/><br/>I played a game of Dogs in the Vineyard with none of the players knowing or having read the rules (just the GM).  We go through character creation without much of a grip on the mechanics.  I pick the more focused character type (fewer dice, but more d8s and d10s) while at least one other player picked a more rounded character type (more dice, but mostly d6s).  I felt really bad because when playing I felt my character was strictly better.  He had more dice, but it's harder to bring all of them in at once, while I just bring in my big ass gun or whatever it was and roll a few d10s and I'm on my way to victory.<br/><br/>I think it's just as valid if not better to introduce what a character looks like, and then go through what all the bits are and how they work in the game until you talk about how to make one.  Making characters is an entirely separate process that's easy to move out of the front of the book, getting to the meat of the game faster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203478/#Comment_203478" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-24T14:49:32+00:00" title="April 24, 2009  2:49PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No worries Jesse! I didn't take offense. <br/><br/>Choosing the appropriate order in which to communicate ideas in games is challenging! People learn in different ways. What is clear to some is opaque to others. Additionally, a game book has to facilitate two very different functions: It must teach the game and it must serve as a reference while playing the game. Those two functions do not necessarily go well together.<br/><br/>For instance, a strict procedural order might make the game easier to learn, but at the same time make the game more challenging to reference.<br/><br/>In fact, in my opinion, we did opt for a procedural order for Mouse Guard that is quite a bit different than the order of our previous games. We placed most of the important rules on the character sheet itself in order to overcome the reference problem. <br/><br/>Here's the basic breakdown of the chapters:<br/><br/>Chapter 1: It Revolves on This. This chapter is the introduction. It covers the structure of the book, the basic ideas behind roleplaying, being a good sport, table chatter, rolling dice, etc. Keep in mind that this game, while eminently playable by experienced gamers, is aimed at young people who are fans of the comics and who may never have roleplayed before. This chapter is about some basic social contract issues and fundamental ideas like fortune, success and failure.<br/><br/>Chapter 2: The Mouse Guard. This chapter provides some history of the Mouse Guard and other color of interest about the setting. It also introduces a character, Sadie, and explains what everything on the character sheet is (excepting <i>how</i> to generate the numbers). Once it gets through the explanations, it also gives you the characters of Kenzie, Saxon and Lieam -- all familiar faces to a fan of the comic.<br/><br/>Chapter 3: It's What We Fight For. This chapter goes into the nitty gritty of Beliefs, Goals, Instincts and Rewards: the core elements of play. Between this chapter and chapter 2, you have all the information you need to really play a Mouse Guard character. In some ways, this chapter is more of a character creation chapter than the actual Recruitment chapter.<br/><br/>Chapter 4: The Mission. Here's the process you were looking for. This chapter takes you through each step of playing a Mouse Guard session, starting with bringing a group together and ending with what you do between sessions. Everything you're asking for is basically here. It's just that once it covers the basic concept here, it directs you to the appropriate chapter for more information.<br/><br/>Chapter 5: Resolution. With the procedures all outlined in the previous chapter, this chapter goes into detail about Obstacles, Conflicts and Conditions.<br/><br/>Chapter 6: Seasons and Chapter 7: The Territories. These are my favorite chapters in the entire book. They are essentially nothing but examples of Obstacles for use in your Mouse Guard game. You could play the game for years based on this stuff.<br/><br/>Chapter 8: Denizens of the Territories. Where chapters 6 and 7 gave you all the Weather and Wilderness obstacles you could ever need, here are all the Mice and Animals obstacles you could want.<br/><br/>Chapter 9: Abilities and skills and Chapter 10: Traits. Now that you've had examples of all sorts of obstacles, these chapters show you which skills and abilities to use to overcome them and how to go about setting an appropriate rating for the obstacles, as well as details on how to use traits.<br/><br/>Chapter 11: Sample Missions. This chapter takes everything from the previous chapters and shows you how to tie everything together with four example missions. It also includes 12 character templates with instructions on how to tweak them.<br/><br/>Chapter 12: Recruitment. And here, finally, we show you how to build your own mouse from scratch.<br/><br/>Note that almost all the important information for how traits work or what nature is printed on your character sheet.<br/><br/>Now, it seems to me that what you're proposing is taking some of the stuff from the Skills and Abilities and Traits chapters and putting them in the (already huge!) Resolution chapter. Should we similarly combine the Resolution chapter with the Mission chapter?<br/><br/>But, of course, some sections of those chapters are actually more connected to the Recruitment chapter than the Resolution chapter. So then we'd have to break each of those concepts into discrete elements in different chapters. Then, in play, you'd have to remember to go to the Mission/Resolution chapter to reference how traits work, but go to the Recruitment chapter to reference the trait descriptions.<br/><br/>Anyway, I see where you're coming from. But every organizational choice creates its own issues and headaches. Your method might make it marginally easier to learn the game for some people, but I think it would also make it much more difficult for some people to reference the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203490/#Comment_203490" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-24T16:11:11+00:00" title="April 24, 2009  4:11PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor Olavsrud</cite>But every organizational choice creates its own issues and headaches.

Since it was mentioned before, I'll bring up Annalise again. Annalise is a terrific game, but as a reference during the game, the text is really frustrating. Since it's divided into two parts with some overlapping information, it's not always apparent which side is the one that will answer your question, so you often have to look at both. I plan to make a cheat sheet for the next time I play Annalise. The concepts aren't difficult - it would just be nice to cover the numbers and phase-specific rules and such that can be hard to remember off hand. <br/><br/>I wish more games included quick reference sheets for the crunchy stuff (I LOVE that Mouse Guard does this on the character sheet), but I do find that making my own - though a little time-consuming - really facilitates a more complete understanding on my part, which is pretty important since I often GM. Right now we're playing a fantastic game of Burning Empires, and there have been a lot of social conflicts, but the time is ripe to be ready for a Firefight. At something like 64 pages, the Firefight chapter is a bit long to just follow and implement during play, so I'm working on a quick reference sheet(s) for it so we can all blow through the steps and consider options as quickly as possible. And because I've taken the time to wrestle with the text, I can verbally (read: much more quickly) explain points of confusion to the others. I've started doing this with other games and it's SUPER helpful. <br/><br/>As a side note, one of the nice things about BW and BE is that you don't have to understand EVERY chapter fully before you play. Conflicts can just be simple verses rolls and although bigger conflicts are better with the more complex resolution mechanics, you can start to get a feel for how the game works and what's important by starting simply.<br/><br/>-Rachel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203624/#Comment_203624" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-26T19:09:34+00:00" title="April 26, 2009  7:09PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a <a href="http://adam.legendary.org/download/annalise/" rel="nofollow">cheat sheet for Annalise</a>.
