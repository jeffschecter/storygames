Everybody writes a page with karma, issue, and strengths, it's all Color and all public.  Each player reads their page out loud following the token rules below.  Mention a few things you're likely to call 'Lame' on if there's anything you can think of, and what you think is Cool and ways to get you to say Damn.<br/><br/><b>First scene starts:</b><br/>Audience starts the scene 'we see...' including at least one player character.<br/><br/>Start talking, let others talk as appropriate, jot down stuff you think is worth jotting down if you're the sort.  You are narrating in first or second person but you can control the external world with this ("I see a man in black heading towards me." "We see someone sneaking up on the man in black from behind."  "I'm totally oblivious as a second person sneaks up behind me.")<br/><br/><b>If someone jumps in on you and says X: Y</b><br/>Risky: What you want is already clear, so someone (could be anybody) has to say something bad that could happen (like 'you could fail', 'someone could see you' or 'but they don't make out like the audience was hoping').  Normally, <b>EDIT: you and the person who said 'Risky' each roll a die, highest roll wins, you win a tie.</b>  However, if you want, you can Back Down.  This means you get a white token and you nullify what you said in the first place.<br/><br/>Cool: You get a cool-blue token, because you made the situation cooler.<br/><br/>Damn: You get a devil-red token, because you made the situation worse.<br/><br/>Lame: You have two options.  Back Off, which means the person who called Lame gets a white Lame token, or Own It, in which case you take the white Lame token yourself.<br/><br/>Fucked Up*: You get a red and a blue token. (<b>Edit: *Said in tortured admiration</b>)<br/><br/>Done: Scene's over.<br/><br/><b>Scene bidding</b><br/>You can't bid if you have a white token.  You can bid for scenes with red or blue, hidden bid, high bid is spent, everyone else keeps theirs.  If no one bids, or everybody has a white token you need to go back to the pitch meeting, write more premise, and hope someone comes up with some cool and damn so somebody can ditch their white, or someone wants to bid.<br/><br/><b>Token Economy:</b><br/>If you have a white token you have to use 1 red and 1 blue token to nullify it as soon as you're able.<br/>You can spend a red token to add 1 to your roll (before the roll, as many times as you like) when someone else says Risky on you. (Fire it up)<br/>You can spend a blue token to add 1 to your roll (before the roll, as many times as you like) when you say Risky. (Cool it off)<br/><br/>So basically you never want to be lame, you want to add "Damn" so you can get what you want while avoiding risks, and being cool gives you more power to make what others don't want happen (and therefore make them likely to say Damn).  You never want Lame.  Blocking with Lame is itself Lame, but possibly worth it, backing off from risks is Lame.<br/><br/><b>Higher-order interactions (saying Damn while someone else says Risky)</b><br/>That's what's interesting to me.  I think this is a major body-language game so I don't think it would work well online.<br/><br/><b>Why I took the time to write it down</b><br/>Because I'm trying to think of a way to set stakes but stay immersed, still be able to prevent something lame without being a jerk about it (if you acquiesce to my 'Lame' I take it, if you don't you're owning it).<br/><br/><b>What I want to know</b><br/>Is this playable?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142779/#Comment_142779" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T22:51:16+00:00" title="May  6, 2008 10:51PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Is this playable?</blockquote>\nIt looks playable to me, personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AdamK" title="AdamK"><img alt="AdamK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AdamK">AdamK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142783/#Comment_142783" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T02:18:25+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  2:18AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I misunderstand something here, but wouldn't the player always back off when Lame is called?

But if the player doesn't accept your block they lose points themselves.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I can't tell.
