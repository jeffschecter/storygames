We've been using minis extensively and...I hate it.<br/><br/>I hate the grid rules in WotC D&amp;D editions. Like...a lot. A whole lot. One of my least favorite parts of play. Seriously, it makes using minis in-fun for me.<br/><br/>So, I was thinking about the way that Fate games sometimes use sketches with zones. I've heard about it, but I don't play those games so I don't have first hand experience with it.<br/><br/>It sounds a little like the way the old TSR Marvel Superheroes game ( FASERIP) used area movement on maps, but possibly even looser.<br/><br/><i>That</i> sounds positive to me.<br/><br/>Anyone have insight on how this all works?<br/><br/>Double bonus points if you're a minis fan who has used them with Fate style sketches and zones successfully.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466422/#Comment_466422" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T13:44:52+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  1:44PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it is just one of many possible degrees of "abstract movement".<br/>You can also look at how the game <b>3:16</b> deals with it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466425/#Comment_466425" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T13:57:19+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  1:57PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was looking for something slightly more than what 3:16 offers.

Thennnnn I'm not sure what to suggest.<br/>Fate Core, if I remember correctly, is a bit more articulated than 3:16 but mostly does the same thing:<br/>- split the location in meaningful sub-areas<br/>- abstractly handle movement from one area to the next<br/>- use fictional positioning and Aspects to detail stuff like cover, terrain, etc<br/><br/>Maybe that's enough details for you.

I think the example of this was a player suggesting that, in a town fight, they wanted to get on a rooftop, effectively creating another connected arena with GM approval.<br/><br/>Like the Fate stuff, "how big" an arena is depends on need. It isn't actually a measured space, grid style. it's more like... a concept of relevant space separated from other related spaces. Think of it a bit like the rooms in a Five Room Dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466446/#Comment_466446" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T18:04:02+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  6:04PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2017 6:05PM by Stephen P.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can say more later if you need, but the <a href="https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/conflicts" rel="nofollow">conflict rules are online here</a>.

But instead of using it with armies, we're going to use it with more RPG numbers of character numbers.<br/><br/>At any given time, we aren't going to be using the whole board. We'll use parts of it at a time.<br/><br/>Drawing from real life, I have a 5' x 6' table. I've decided that we're playing a game where each major location gets its own 2' x 2' square, so we have 6 units, in a 2 unit by 3 unit rectangle. The positions of each unit roughly show how those areas are located in general relation to one another. Like this, with each unit (each square being a general location for the broader adventure).<br/><br/>1-2-3<br/>4-5-6<br/><br/>Within each unit, we can get a little fractal. Maybe Unit 1 is the inside of a laboratory, while Unit 2 is the jungle you have to pass through to get there. And each unit has zones/terrain/areas of interest and impact within it.<br/><br/>The lab might be pretty easy to do, whether it's a single big room divided into zones or a complex of multiple rooms. That jungle unit gets trickier.<br/><br/>I thought about just using yarn, but that seems like a bit of a pain in the butt.

Now I have a Field and a Forest as two adjacent zones, so there is a third zone Between, "between the field and the forest". My character is in the Field, your character is in the Forest, it stays like that unless I make a move toward the Forest (maybe I end up Between, maybe in the Forest) or your character makes a move that places me in Between. Mostly, being Between is the same as being both in the Field and in the Forest, except for interaction with other zones (maybe I can no longer easily shoot at the field-adjacent Road).<br/><br/>External State Markers:<br/>Zones and positions within them are inherently fuzzy. Abstract then reify that. Place your mini where aesthetic and update your token on your character's decent-sized cardboard circle off the map, saying which of 6-8 discrete directions you are canonically facing, your relative positioning in the overall zone, possibly your momentum if needed. These dictate the broad scope of targeting, whether you can reach the next zone, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466503/#Comment_466503" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T01:52:00+00:00" title="September 23, 2017  1:52AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My understanding of Fate-like zones (and Red Box Hack arenas, which I assume Old School Hack is based upon) is that they're either a theatre-of-the-mind thing, or a sketch-out-boundaries-on-blank-paper-or-a-whiteboard thing.<br/><br/>Since you're using wargame terrain (how dense or sparse are terrain pieces on your table, usually?), defining zones by centerpiece rather than boundaries - as you say yourself - looks like the obvious thing to do. For those who said you're not getting it: it means defining your zones such as "by the oak tree", "around the keep" or "close to the farmhouse", leaving boundaries entirely fuzzy.<br/><br/>The alternative I can think of - and the reason I'm posting this, really - is using your terrain <i>as</i> boundaries. Read the table as a non-square, irregular grid, where each line-of-sight blocking terrain feature counts as an intersection in the grid, each prolonged, obvious barrier as line (that is, at least two "nodes", where it begins and where it ends). Any two nodes you can easily paint an imaginary line between, those lines are the lines in your grid, your zone boundaries.<br/>This should make for zones which are easy to read (it's still a grid) without drawing any actual grid, but which are perhaps hard to label/describe - thus, it won't work well with rules that care which zone is broken ground and which is forest, which arena is crowded and which is dangerous... But I expect it to work well if it's about charging and retreating and more traditional D&amp;D-ish stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466514/#Comment_466514" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T13:07:21+00:00" title="September 23, 2017  1:07PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some good stuff. the more I think about the clear tape suggestion, the more I like it. It's something I could definitely use for times when it's a mostly outdoors type table set up and I'm using a big sheet of felt as the table base.<br/><br/>Guy hit on something important to play style. Even with zone/arena translations to minis use/2d/3d, I'd still want players to at least give a nod to aesthetics. That's part of the fun of using the toys! Frex, if a zone ( blown up a bit so minis can fit there) was supposedly a maze of stacked crates, I'd want players to think a bit about position within that maze of crates when duking it out or shooting it out within that zone with some baddies. <br/><br/>I get that zone style/arena style approaches do assume a certain swirl-of-combat/action, with characters in motion, regardless of the static pose nature of miniatures, but, aesthetic joy is important. How much that matters in game mechanical terms I'm still pondering.<br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more I wonder if I could combine the concept of zones/arenas with the 'center piece" of the zone idea, through using little glass craft beads. I'm thinking of those little rounded, flat on one side things you find in craft sections and floral sections of stores. We used to use them as blood point markers in games of Jyhad/VtES years back.<br/><br/>Here's my thinking: At the start of an encounter, the GM just plain lays out some of those beads on the surface, roughly at the center of each zone/arena. FATE-style, if there's some Aspect equivalent to note, they just do that verbally.<br/><br/>Of course, for aesthetic reasons, there should be some related terrain that makes sense to pair that with. Even "Big open field with low weeds" can be an aspect, right?<br/><br/>In terms of numbers, there's never going to be a lot of zones at any one time for a single encounter. Probably in the 3-7 range. <br/><br/>Of course there's also the opposite implication on a fully laid-out table: if it isn't established as a zone at the start of an encounter, it isn't considered relevant to the encounter. Someone moving a miniature out of the defined cluster of zones/arenas is only allowed to do that if they're trying to say they've abandoned the action of the encounter entirely.<br/><br/>The zone boundaries are visually fuzzy, but the connection of one zone to the next should be fairly obvious. (Maybe?)<br/><br/>Once action commences, it's important for the players to note where their characters are, in terms of zone/arenas, and naturally, people are going to have to say specifically if they're attempting to leave one zone and enter another. It can't be functionally an accidental slide into a new zone.<br/><br/>By the time those beads get moved ( almost inevitable, given play with minis), the zones should be already established in players' minds.<br/><br/>I think/hope that can work. Does anyone see any serious, obvious problems I'm overlooking?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466515/#Comment_466515" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T13:38:09+00:00" title="September 23, 2017  1:38PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2017 1:39PM by komradebob.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now, I don't have any pics of a table layout I can show you with a big 3D layout.<br/><br/>I have been looking at the following 2D product for a while now, thinking about doing a short (1-3 session) I6: Ravenloft inspired game:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/195414/Heroic-Maps--Giant-Maps-Schloss-von-Nachtherz?cPath=10143_21946" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/195414/Heroic-Maps--Giant-Maps-Schloss-von-Nachtherz?cPath=10143_21946</a><br/><br/>I'm thinking that the beads idea might be the easiest way to approach that. It gives a lot of flexibility to effectively slow down initial exploration in a way that I want, but would be hard to achieve with more standard D&amp;D movement rate/range rules ( any edition really). With standard movement and range rules, PCs could basically zoom through the place. Not really what I want.<br/><br/>I could do things like sub-divide bigger rooms into a couple of zones or only allow a few directly connected rooms to be an encounter zone cluster.<br/><br/>On the flip side, if the game ends with a big showdown/chase through the whole of the place, I could also just broaden the zones to include multiple rooms as a single zone, perhaps with some sort of aspects that differ from the initially used ones.<br/><br/>Does that make a bit more sense?<br/><br/>Good idea? bad idea?

I mean, if there is some sort of physical quality of the area for players to exploit or to annoy players with, that makes things a bit more fun, right?<br/><br/>What I found recently playing a 5e D&amp;D game with grid being used along with minis/markers was that, in practice, we were almost using zones anyway. OTOH, we were still stuck with some general silliness of space counting. Space counting that in practice did very little other than waste time, whether for movement or ranged fire issues.<br/><br/>What I mean is, we were using a fairly big dry erase grid ( maybe 30 x 20 or so?), but the battle we fought last ended up effectively breaking into say 6-7 zone equivalents. Occasionally, a PC would make a longish move, but it generally then brought them into another "zone" where some sort of melee was going on with baddies. Occasionally, a PC maneuvered a small bit to come into range of a target with a ranged attack, but it was always a bit minor in effect.<br/><br/>Yet we still counted the squares and so on ( including for some reason annoying diagonals count differently rules. 4e had it right, diagonals are the same distance, just watch out for choke points blocking diagonal movement!).<br/><br/>It would have been so much easier to skip that nonsense and just declare a zone to zone move. Ranged attacks could have been easily translated in some fashion as well.<br/><br/>And of course it also allows a bit for what War of Ashes is talking about-distances are relative. Maybe a 6" x 6" zone really is D&amp;D style and represents truly a 30' x 30' area. Maybe it's a bit bigger, 60' x 60' or 90' x 90'.

In particular, motion and positioning works strictly narratively.  On a 5 or 6 "you move decisively towards your goal", on a 3 or 4 "your motion towards your goal is mixed, misdirected, blocked, or uncertain", and on a 1 or 2, \xffou lose ground".  Zones and boundaries aren't really needed.  <br/><br/>I might be missing something here, but I remember in an earlier thread we talked about centering the action around a specific terrain piece, e.g. a fountain in the town square; which is narratively important.  So, the monster is coming out of the fountain.  The warrior-princess says she is going to attack it, rolls 3,4,3,2.  Assigns 3 to motion, she can only get part way there this turn (something blocked her way, or she tripped on a loose paver, etc., whatever).  Meanwhile the the huntress-wizard, fires her bow at the monster.  She is really far away, but rolls 2, 4, 5, 6.  Assigns 6 to motion.  However the player narrates it, she is in range.  Maybe the character leaped into range at the last possible moment, or the monster's tentacle lurched towards her just close enough, or the hand of the goddess miraculously guided the arrow, whatever. <br/><br/>It seems to me, that in a story-game (even one where the aesthetics of the toys are the point), movement/time is both relative and a combination of multiple characters/entities actions taken in concert--and therefore shouldn't be strictly quantified.  Nothing is really static--static time/turns/movement is an old wargame management technique.<br/><br/>(Edited to explain my thoughts more clearly.

I promise, I will get back to them.<br/><br/>For a sec, I'd like to go back to that link to the Vampire castle I mentioned earlier, and use it as example of where my thought process is going right now. Partly because I'm thinking of using it for a one shot Halloween game, partly because the gist of I6: Ravenloft is pretty widely known even if you've never played it, and partly because I don't have pics of a 3D table set up to share with y'all as an example. <br/><br/>Anyway, here's the link again, so take a quick look at it:<br/><a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/195414/Heroic-Maps--Giant-Maps-Schloss-von-Nachtherz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://drivethrurpg.com/product/195414/Heroic-Maps--Giant-Maps-Schloss-von-Nachtherz</a><br/><br/>I'm sure you all get the essence of the situation: there's a Bad vampire Who Needs Killin' and the party is heading to his chateau to do just that.<br/><br/>Looking at that ginormo tile layout, you probably also notice a couple of problems if you've been using those D&amp;D style grid rules. Even a 50' x 50' mat doesn't really end up being a whole lot of real estate compared to the move and range distances used in those grid rules, even when you account for double/triple move cost for some of that terrain and blocked lines of sight.<br/><br/>And then, of course, when you start actually putting minis in that space, it becomes pretty dense in any room, even with just RPG levels of opposition + party members.<br/><br/>OTOH, that same mat takes up a whole lot of real world, real table real estate with its 50 x 50 footprint.<br/><br/>And on a general play thing, you neither want the party to zoom through the whole layout nor do you want every monster to come running to lay siege to the party the very first time a noisy fight breaks out. Even in a one-night one-shot, you want a bit of exploration and at least a few distinct scenes/encounters, right?<br/><br/>Okay that's the rub of it, and The Problem. This post is long, so I'll stop here and come back in the next post to talk about thinking of this in terms of zones/arenas and bead marking.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466542/#Comment_466542" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-25T13:43:46+00:00" title="September 25, 2017  1:43PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so you've got that link open, you're looking halfway down the page, you can see the small pic of what the whole layout looks like, right? <br/><br/>The lower third of the layout is woods and trails leading up to the castle, the upper two thirds the castle itself with a tiny bit of narrow outside areas surrounding it. Feasibly our heroes don't need to go through the front door, but they at likely to start somewhere in that lower third, and hey, that almost calls for some kind of encounter potential on the way to the castle.<br/><br/>For simplicity, let's say they start at the lower left edge, on the trail. Seems like a good spot and we can probably place our 4-6 hero minis down there easily. Baron Fang likely has some minions lurking about. The players start cautiously following the trail up and to the right, when (gasp!), they run into some minions! Who knew?<br/><br/>Let's say the head of the party march column/scout is about where that little clearing is just above the S in the word <i>maps</i> in the pic. A few verbally descriptions by the GM give some clues about what is coming, and a werewolf, a wolf pack and some bats pop up to threaten the party!<br/><br/>Great, so where do the beads go to define roughly the zones?<br/><br/>I spot four zones/arenas immediately:<br/>1) The clearing itself<br/>2) NNW( left and up) of the clearing, the clump of trees and a bit of cliff<br/>3) NNE ( right and up) The sparsely tree covered cliff sides<br/>4) SSE ( almost straight down and to the right of the clearing) Another clump of forest<br/><br/>Now any of those could be given the equivalent of a starting capital A Aspect.<br/><br/>My intention here isn't to tightly define any one of those arenas/zones. It's to break up the fight a bit, make players make choices about where to be and how they can sup[ort each other's characters in the scrum. The zones should roughly ( I hope) imply how they're connected, even though I haven't gone out of my way to specify boundaries. Without boundaries it should still be a situation where we have enough room for minis in each zone, and players can still get creative with using any on mat illustrations in creative ways. A little moving around within a zone is to be encouraged for toyplay joy reasons as well.<br/><br/>As  to all of the rest of the mat? If it ain't defined initially as a zone, t either needs to become an added zone through play of the encounter, or it needs to just plain be considered to be an "exit and holding pattern" area.<br/><br/>All I mean by that is, if a player says something like " I want to dash over to the steps of the castle", I need to ask some questions about intent. Is the dash to those steps about gaining some kind of advantage in the current encounter in one of the zones, or is it about escaping the current encounter? I guess that how I'd deal with that would be informed by my broader interest in not seeing all of the mat used in one big running scrum.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's the basic concept I'm at right now.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Overlooked problems?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466543/#Comment_466543" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-25T16:21:00+00:00" title="September 25, 2017  4:21PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In defence of 5e and counting spaces on a grid I have to say that it only makes any difference if there is cover and significant obstacles at least every 20' or so. If the battleground is going to be always a barren open space that will definitely make counting spaces a time-wasting useless chore. And yes, never use those diagonal counts differently rules, they suck.<br/><br/>However, when we use maps for a whole area those are never scaled to mini size, and used instead for travel-like navigation. We only jump to mini-scaled maps for battle. So, whenever the PCs find an encounter on the navigational map and stealth or talking things out fail, only then we draw a quick map defining the boundaries of the area and near accessible areas <i>if</i> they matter for the battle. Going out of this map means the character is escaping and we use plain abstraction and rolls when things get there, unless a chase scene with some combat ensues, which happens rarely.<br/><br/>The thing about having significant obstacles and cover is that these create smaller and more dynamic zones by themselves; maneuvers for flanking, getting sneak attacks, hiding, finding cover from arrows or spells, etc. become far more interesting. Players have to think in 3d and also climb to get advantage. Monsters can fly and climb too, which makes them even more dangerous. And if you set the battle arena so their opponents have some advantage and/or made preparations like traps, choking points, hiding places, etc. the challenges may go up 1CR just because of this.<br/><br/>After a while, the next time they play on a barren space will feel like more dangerous as they will have to rely on AC and HP to keep fighting.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of putting the whole map on the table as it kinda ruins a bit the fun of discovery, though its mostly because I enjoy more googling up some 'concept art' of whatever place the characters could be and showing that to the players to boost our immersion. But that's just our tastes, I understand how laying the whole map for the players to enjoy and wonder what's that up in the north could be tons of fun too.<br/><br/>But that's 5e.<br/><br/>With a system of your own however, without using grids nor full abstraction there are other simple ways to deal with distances and zones. Zones are basically boundaries that require certain conditions to get through:<br/><br/>-You need to win a combat there to go through safely, or risk receiving damage when going through and maybe more when running away from it.<br/>-You need to traverse it in stealth or risk being discovered and have opponents rushing in this zone every 1d6 turns.<br/>-Etc.<br/><br/>Also inside that boundary the same conditions prevail despite the dimensions of the zone. A vertical pit will present the danger of falling damage, a road will be somewhat the same for a few yards, a clear in the forest without no other features will have the same lighting conditions, etc.<br/><br/>So you just need to define those conditions and then mark/explain the boundaries of each area to the players. All this can be done through narration, it will feel more natural and I'd say that on par of using beads anyway.<br/><br/>About distances, you can always set up your own ruler. I think I got this idea from some modern minis wargame:<br/><br/>-Take a belt-shaped (or is it a tape-shaped?) piece of flexible cardboard.<br/>-Cut it to be as long as what could be considered a 'far' distance in your map, as in the longest range of a bow.<br/>-Mark each third of it. 1/3 is the maximum range for weapons, 2/3 is the maximum range for dashing your whole turn.<br/><br/>In play, this ruler is used -somewhat loosely- for both firing range and movement. Use it straight for ranged attacks -things in the path will block line of sight- and curve it around obstacles if needed to measure movement distances.<br/><br/>The thing about making your own measuring tape is that you can scale distances to make rushing your whole map in one turn physically impossible. Abstract boundaries will reinforce this.<br/><br/>Your beads idea looks solid in paper, but by rule of thumb procedures that you and your group aren't familiar with will usually get overriden after a few tries for whatever feels more familiar for your group, unless the procedure actually makes things a lot more easier. Most possible is that you will lose the beads after a while as your group learns to use zones more quickly. Best luck with this! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466544/#Comment_466544" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-25T17:34:50+00:00" title="September 25, 2017  5:34PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm hoping the whole beads things is more like training wheels for the concept that are dispensed with quickly after some experience.<br/><br/>To a degree, I also wanted them to indicate where you couldn't go.

Imagine a village with a church, an inn and four other buildings surrounding a town square, with some fenced in areas near each building and a couple of roads or alleys separating some of the buildings. How many zones is that? I suspect there are multiple possible answers to that, and that the answers could vary even in different "encounters" in the same overall game.<br/><br/>I cheated a bit in that example  gave of using the vampire castle layout I linked upthread, by using one of the outdoor areas on the layout.<br/><br/><a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/195414/Heroic-Maps--Giant-Maps-Schloss-von-Nachtherz?term=schloss+von&amp;test_epoch=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://drivethrurpg.com/product/195414/Heroic-Maps--Giant-Maps-Schloss-von-Nachtherz?term=schloss+von&amp;test_epoch=0</a><br/><br/>It would get trickier once the party hits the interior, I suspect, even if I printed that thing up with the No Grid option.<br/><br/>On the left side of that layout, about a third of the way down from the top, is a throne room. In the old I6: Ravenloft, there's an encounter/scene with Strahd and his throne room, that could be fun and inspirational. If it comes down to combat ( why wouldn't it, really?) what would the zones/arenas be?<br/><br/>My instinct says there are at least three initial zones: The dais, and two main floor zones. Three, if for no other reason than I want to break things up a bit, and even give the ranged characters a chance to show off their Thing. I <i>might</i> consider a fourth zone, being whatever the last room the characters were in before they entered the throne room. I could possibly see adding two different extra zones/arenas depending upon what happens in play. One could be the ceiling and upper columns if someone starts flying about or Baron Fang starts some Spider-Man type antics, and another if Baron Fang decides to go out a window behind the throne as a quick escape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466569/#Comment_466569" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-26T12:44:48+00:00" title="September 26, 2017 12:44PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, some of y'all are hitting me with some $10 Vocab words.<br/><br/>Truthfully, <i>mimesis</i> and <i>reify</i> are both outside of my wheelhouse.

Okay, now I'm getting you.<br/><br/>I personally see it as a transitional step to bring folks back over to eventually using more free flowing toy play.<br/><br/>At some level, I want toy use informed by war game style stuff. For example, I don't want someone going wildly off the general way other folks are playing because there are no written constraints on say, move distance.<br/><br/>I just want it vastly more freeflowing than grid or measured movement.<br/><br/>At the same time, I wan to not use the entirety of a physical layout all at once, no matter what form it takes. Zones/arenas or something like them suggested itself for that reason.<br/><br/>Some of that simply comes down to difficulties/limitations of the medium of miniatures and terrain. Whether 2d or 3d or a combo of both, it would be whole lot easier for me to do a pregame setup for the bulk of the non-character/monster layout ahead of time for a session, rather than doing lots of change ups mid-session to limit the areas of use at any time.<br/><br/>That's a bit of what that tangent about hypothetical standardized 2' x 2' units was about back near the beginning of the thread.<br/><br/>Several years back, I did some experimenting/play testing of no rules, free flow, toy play style approaches. In the first game, it was me and one buddy, and it pretty much worked out great. Between us, we gelled on the concept of only using part of the layout at a time, and so on.<br/><br/>Second time around, it was 5 or 6 players trying something broadly similar. All but one guy got it. That one guy though threw a lot of the rest of it off by trying to do things like use the whole board at once. rather than "entering" the scene's physical space with a character first ( specifically involving a wildly cross board rifle shot with a character).<br/><br/>I'm also trying to avoid that.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466585/#Comment_466585" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-26T18:38:12+00:00" title="September 26, 2017  6:38PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><i>reify</i> ...

In general it's hard to go from fictional harm to fictional consequences of that harm in a principled way that everyone's on board with. Let's wipe out the nuance, then, and just say a character has 10 points of "I'm not dead yet!" and when they take harm they lose set amounts of points and when they reach 0 they're dead. Just invented HP. But shouldn't the fighter be way hardier than the wizard? Okay fighter gets 12 HP and wizard gets 6 HP. Now fictionally, do whatever seems appropriate based on the number of HP you have left, possibly compared to your maximum HP.<br/><br/>It's hard to tell whether a character with a mini <i>here</i> can run up to and attack a character with a mini <i>there</i> with a sword. In general it's hard to tell distance and fine facing with minis on a map, especially compared to move speed and momentum and terrain obstacles and whatnot. Let's wipe out the nuance, then, and have a set number of Areas probably based on a central feature apiece like "this is the farmstead Area", and each area is a Zone as well as make an intermediate Zone for each adjacent pair (or triples, etc) of Areas like "this is the farmstead/river Zone", and that induces a graph with Zones as nodes and connectedness as edges and no Area Zone is directly connected to another Area Zone. Each character must be located in a node on the graph, and their mini may be placed wherever seems appropriate on the map based on correspondence between the map features and Zones. Melee can freely move up and hit anyone also in their Zone, or run to an adjacent Zone and hit anyone there with a penalty, or run 2 Zones. Ranged can shoot in Zone or adjacent, or 2 Zones away with a penalty, or run to adjacent and shoot in new Zone or adjacent with a penalty, or run 2 Zones. Just like each character has HP to track external to the map, now each character has Zone location to track external to the map.<br/><br/>Here is a map: <a href="https://www.elventower.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/44-Throne-RoomL-1200x903.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.elventower.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/44-Throne-RoomL-1200x903.jpg</a><br/><br/>Here is one graph you could draw, Areas in <b>bold</b>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1b_WWThbDEszWjlHmm9ao73MDKAX3_HT7yvs6X7K5ReM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1b_WWThbDEszWjlHmm9ao73MDKAX3_HT7yvs6X7K5ReM/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>Here is another graph you could draw, to incorporate spidering: <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LRMz7ZnXrhnDkXc4grX_NuvqPS3_vKwt5yo6Mgeqikc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LRMz7ZnXrhnDkXc4grX_NuvqPS3_vKwt5yo6Mgeqikc/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>In that one I've cheated a bit already and let the "climbing" intermediate Zone be connected to any of the main room's regular Zones. And maybe you want to allow a special two-Zone-move plus melee attack for this map only.

Some of it has to do with the physical constraints involved with minis use. Some of it has to do with the toy play fun aspects.<br/><br/>Some general concepts:<br/><br/>A) When an encounter occurs, the GM ( or scene setter) <i>has to </i><b>define</b> 3-5 nodes ( although maybe up to 7 ? ). Lower than that should be rare, and probably you never want to start with 7, although circumstance may suggest a couple of possible add-on nodes during play.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> As the nodes are defined, a marker is placed somewhere within the physical area representing the node, and the GM <b>must</b>point out any obvious "aspect" of the node and note any non-obvious connections (or problems with connections) between nodes as the markers are placed. Basically, if there's a problem moving between 2 nodes or firing from one node to the next, ya kinda gotta note that when you lay the beads down. To degree, this may be defined by some wysiwigness of the terrain toys.<br/><br/>C) By implication, a character is in a node or not in a node, and there's an inherent implication that moving  between nodes takes some sort of statement by a player (and effort by character), as does interacting between nodes.<br/><br/>Toy Aspects and space<br/><br/>A) A node needs to be big enough physically for character toys to fit into it How big? Kinda flexible. How big are the toys? What are the terrain toys like? A fight with a big whacking Dragon toy might require a different use of nodes and space than a scrum with more human sized critters. In any case, a node is still a node.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Players need to state ( and possibly clarify as needed) what node their character is in at any time. Where toys are concerned, they need to be placed in a way that shows they're interacting in a specific node.<br/><br/>C) Within a node, players and GMs are supposed to be using what they see in terms of terrain. This gets a bit into the "aspects" talked about earlier. If there are crates in the node, a player can state that their character is ducking behind the crates and should place their toy to show that.<br/><br/>D) Minis are "semi-static", especially within a given zone. <b>This is one that I have some concerns about.</b> While it was discussed earlier how more abstract, non-minis versions of these concepts assume a certain "swirl of combat", that you can't quite be sure where a given character or opponent is in a given node because everyone is presumed to be moving around a bit at all times, I do favor a somewhat more static approach when using minis ( although looser than grid style rules).  To an extent, where people are physically shown to be by the minis in a given node should matter to a degree.\n<blockquote>Example: There's Node A  where a fight has been going on. A PC mini has been described as ducking behind crates on the West/Left side of this node. The player now wants to move their character from Node A east/right to Node B. In Node A, a bunch of baddies are involved in some other combats going on between where the PC is hiding and the general obvious path to Node B. I still want this to matter, even though we're assuming some general movement as the baddies are involved with melees with various other PCs in Node A. FWIW, this could equally be an issue of firing between Node A and Node B.</blockquote>\nMind you, I want to keep the rules fairly light. I guess I could give penalties ( if you move through the melee to get there, maybe you have to make a roll to do so, or you can make the move to the next node but all of your actions are essentially used up doing so. If you're shooting into the next node, you take a penalty for what is going on between your PC's location and the next over, but on a miss you can decide your character simply refused to take the shot because they couldn't be sure of doing so without hitting a friend, etc).<br/><br/>Anyway, that's where I'm at right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466611/#Comment_466611" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-27T14:44:18+00:00" title="September 27, 2017  2:44PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2017 2:44PM by Paul_T.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the nodes/beads system. (Although I agree with your potential complaints, as well.)<br/><br/>In my opinion, the most fun way to do this would be a little different: instead of measuring or marking zones and locations on the map, what if we Create some "meta" rules which we apply by judgment case by case?<br/><br/>A simple example:<br/><br/>Normally, a character/mini can move wherever it seems reasonable, simply by saying so and moving the mini.<br/><br/>However, the other players can draw on one of the following rules if the movement seems more complicated:<br/><br/>"That is a challenging maneuver/you might not make it through" (e.g. Climbing a wall, swimming through a moat)<br/><br/>"You might not make it there in time!"<br/><br/>"There's someone in your way!"<br/><br/>"That sounds desperate; you might arrive off-balance"<br/><br/>"That could give you a tactical advantage"<br/><br/>Each would have some simple form of resolution attached. When it's announced, the player can reconsider and choose a different move or go through with it afternoon all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466615/#Comment_466615" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-27T15:19:29+00:00" title="September 27, 2017  3:19PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reminds me a little of some of the Archipelago mechanics, so I like that.<br/><br/>Let me broaden this a bit. <br/><br/>For those of you who've played with folks used to grids ( or measured movement, etc) and then gone over to more something like nodes/zones/arenas, what were the difficulties in getting other players on board and how did you deal with them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466623/#Comment_466623" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-27T22:22:47+00:00" title="September 27, 2017 10:22PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm I think that things can be solved with even less rules. I mean, for one,<i> nodes are dynamic</i>: they get defined by where the opponents clash and the boundaries get determined by changing circumstances. Two spaces separated by a wall could become two areas... unless defenders use the wall as a barricade and then the wall becomes a single node for this battle.<br/><br/><i>Range distances are static</i>: ranged weapons will have a range able to cover two or three zones top, but that's it. Common fiction limitations will take charge of the rest, even if the weapon range exceeds the size of the map. You could get obscured targets and cover as well as the shape of the places also determine a feasible excuse to not let players snipe opponents from a corner of the map. Even if that happens, it will be believable if that's how the terrain is, barren, open and with no place to hide.<br/><br/>This will make you think different as a GM if you embrace it. Changing the rules so it doesn't happen is the path to breaking immersion and having strange things happening in the fiction. I'm seeing this ranged-weaponry abuse case myself as one of the players in our D&amp;D campaign is mostly based on ranged weaponry and stealth, as in taking advantage of the maximum range of the longbow and navigating the fiction to start the battle at that range, as often as he can. You will probably agree with me that this makes for a cheap one-trick pony that ruins what could otherwise be an epic battle where characters can hear whatever they shout at each other, where close quarters make things really dangerous. But there are ways to deal with this without changing the game rules.<br/><br/>Now whenever I'm doing prep I just try t think too: how does this opponent protects itself from ranged attacks? Is his normal defence enough? Then, does it uses minions, cover, stealth, magic or what? I found that the game itself has a lot of reliable tools to take charge of this, I just have to think about the problem and solve it in the fiction.<br/><br/>The rest of the tools I use:<br/><br/>-A caveat we agree on before play: "nothing is infallible", meaning that nothing in the system gives a player an automatic success, they have to earn that success either by navigating the fiction properly or rolling high enough for it. (I don't even narrate "you fail" too often, I narrate instead how the opponent does something more clever, unexpected or perhaps is plain lucky.)<br/><br/>-The question "And exactly how do you do that?", which gives the narrator enough detail about the execution of the intent to determine if the fiction is being navigated in a way that gives the character an automatic success, a bonus to the roll, a penalty or if the action fails automatically given the circumstances presented or still hidden in the prep.<br/><br/>-Everything can be handled by rolling dice: Want to go there? You can, roll athletics to make it in time, though. Roll stealth to make it quietly. Roll athletics again to climb that high. Want to shoot a guy on the other side of the map? Roll perception to see if you get a clear shot. Now roll the attack. Make it just a couple of rolls if you can; more and it will look like you're making excuses for railroading as you can see here.<br/><br/>-Consensus by the dice: For any occasion where consensus couldn't be reached through argumentation we left things to the dice and moved on. It must be either your call or my call? then let's roll a die and whoever rolls higher gets their call executed, doesn't matter who was right. We move on and make up a ruling later if necessary.<br/><br/>I've been playing for years using maps and no grid.

Used some very similar methods even.<br/><br/>It's only having played WotC D&amp;D ( 5e) that I start to become concerned with this.<br/><br/>As to ranged abuse, I'm torn. I really do et why a player would want that to be their character's Thing. It's very Robin Hood at minimum. OTOH, our group was discussing our high level Ranger's capabilities a while back, and the player of that character pointed out that, in theory, they could fire their bow fairly accurately out to 600'/200 yards.<br/><br/>I did some quick mental math on what that would mean on the table top with minis.<br/>600'/5'= 120 grid squares ( which are 1" x 1" in real world measure). That's10' in real world distance ( a bit under 4 meters for you metric folks)! <br/><br/>Good Lawd, y'all! Who has a table that big!?! I rarely see that even at conventions!<br/><br/>Compare that to rules in actual minis games and it still seems huge. I think max range on long bows used by elves with gaming scale ( 25/28mm) minis in Games Workshop games maxes out at about 36".<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, still looking forward to Stephen P's thoughts.<br/><br/>edited to add:<br/><br/>Some of this quandary is surely my own fault for wanting to have more set up to use, than will be used at one time.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466634/#Comment_466634" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-28T17:55:36+00:00" title="September 28, 2017  5:55PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right Komradebob, when we noticed he could shot anything from one corner of the mat to... a mat in another room, I had to start thinking on other excuses beyond "no, your target isn't in range".

              Ranges are...weird.<br/><br/>[Prepare for total tangent that goes completely opposite of what I'm trying to really get a handle on in this thread]<br/><br/>With D&amp;D, the WotC editions went with 1" =5'.<br/><br/>TSR D&amp;D had 1"= 10' underground and, IIRC 10 yards outside. This let more stuff fit on the tabletop.<br/><br/>Also, miniatures were bittier in the 70s and early 80s, in general. Made it a whole lot easier to fit 3 minis on a 1" / 10' frontage per early tradition.<br/><br/>Anyway, the trick is...D&amp;D is super melee oriented. So the rules, and especially the WotC ones, are very well geared for melee and use of RPG normal amounts of table space.<br/><br/>They aren't so great for ranged weaponry, at least if minis are used. On one hand, ranged attacks have a really big distance ( in theory), but in practice rarely have a chance to use  that full potential. If they do have the chance to use that potential, they get really dominant.<br/><br/>IOW, it's goofy in practice.<br/><br/>Which leads back to me wanting to use something more based on zones/arenas/nodes or just plain rules that don't really get into distances in a set form ( like PbtA influenced games).<br/><br/>So, max ranges are an interesting constraint/issue, but not when they are wildly out of scale with everything else ( such as movement and shorter ranged weapons)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466648/#Comment_466648" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T00:46:57+00:00" title="September 29, 2017 12:46AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Btw, if any of you get to look at it, check out the Mansions of Madness boardgame tiles.<br/><br/>They pack a lot of zones/nodes/arenas into a small amount of table space. Their ranged weapons have distances between 1-3 spaces/zones ( plus the one you're in). In practice, that would mean that weapons, if translated to inches/grid spaces would be somewhere around 9-12" max. That includes some fairly long ranged stuff, like tommy guns.<br/><br/>And you still have some effects like what Warrior Monk mentioned, where LOS is blocked and often effective range is less than max. And of course, movement limits some ranged use as well, along the lines of what Guy was mentioning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466703/#Comment_466703" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T09:20:54+00:00" title="September 30, 2017  9:20AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Coming soon, promise!) <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466867/#Comment_466867" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-07T15:24:54+00:00" title="October  7, 2017  3:24PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I admit I was kinda holding off for Stephen P, but does anyone else have thoughts on this stuff?<br/><br/>Howabout non-zone, but minis using options, that also don't get too heavily into measurements?

And in terms of my mini+ Lego story-game idea from before.<br/><br/>What if every location had a scale and a focal-point.  Let's say three different scales from smallest to biggest: micro, heroica, and minifigure.  You could represent all kinds of settings from grand vistas to villages to individual rooms.  You could use different scale miniatures, 10mm, 25mm, 54mm (since you're an old wargamer like me).  And every character's movement and missile's range also had a narratively described scale equivalent: slow/average/fast and thrown/hurled/shot.  The fulcrum of "measuring" is the focal point of the setting.<br/><br/>For actions, 4d6 are rolled and 1d6 is assigned to movement/range as mentioned above: 1-2 fail, 3-4 partial, 5-6 success.<br/><br/>In the smallest/intimate/face-to-face setting (i.e. minifigure, 54mm), a fast/shot can reach anywhere in play, with anything but a failed roll; a average/hurled can reach anywhere on a success but only as far as the focal point on a partial; and a slow/thrown can only reach the focal point on a success.  <br/><br/>In the heroica scale,... well I'm not going to write it all out but you can see where I'm going with this.<br/><br/>With a little more thought, this system could probably work for moving between settings/locations as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466882/#Comment_466882" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-08T08:41:32+00:00" title="October  8, 2017  8:41AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2017 8:50AM by DeReel.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (from a bunker in the jungle) <br/>'Click'<br/>The answer to this space representation problem will vary with : vehicles, weapons. Think : acrobatics or motorcycle ; melee or artillery. Simulation games generally have different rules to simulate pre and post gunpowder era, with a reason. <br/><br/>The "line of sight" suggestion by Rafu also points to a third aspect : setting. So 3rd alternative to pick from : drama 1st or combat 1st. To do Artillery and Drama, as I understand, I would think in spatial sets : areas containing areas, sometimes overlapping. <br/><br/>So, yes : the minis should be somehow arranged around the spot that's key to their zone. It's perfectly OK if the boundaries are only defined verbally. In case of fuzzyness actually creating negociation, you need to find a quick rule for decision making, like "the player is always right about what she pictured" or "maneuver roll will tell".<br/><br/>Of course, contemporary warfare will create very remote spacial sets. Think acrobatics or airborne. In this case, the very intent of mini-ing all those elements in a continous  map is impossible. The spatial set tool, however, should still be effective.<br/>(ending radio transmission)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466984/#Comment_466984" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-13T14:38:12+00:00" title="October 13, 2017  2:38PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking about some of this, and for a second just tabling the zones/nodes part, has anyone done Dungeon World or some other PtbA based game and used minis?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467490/#Comment_467490" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-05T13:16:42+00:00" title="November  5, 2017  1:16PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I pondered on all kinds of stuff people have posted about in this thread.<br/><br/>Here's where I'm thinking currently on this topic.<br/><br/>First, when it comes to rpgs, my main inclination is to go with a relatively close translation of non-minis rules/methods. For the most part, anyway.<br/><br/>By that I just mean, play it fast and loose. Certainly before any action/combat breaks out, just play it the way you would anything else. As GM mostly you're just facilitating play and moving the spotlight around, maybe making some calls on the sequence of events.<br/><br/>Players tell you what they want the characters to do, and when, and you just kinda watch things and let them develop naturally, maybe putting some breaks on an individual PCs actions if it is ether eating up time on one hand or doing too much more than is justified compared to the actions of other PCs.<br/><br/>IOW, standard non-minis using practice, but moving the minis around the environment as needed to match up with the described, developing events.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bullet-time, or general Slo-Mo action-y stuff</span><br/><br/>When action breaks out, or is about to break out, I guess procedure becomes a brief transitional "phase".<br/><br/>This is a final bit where action stops to make sure that any needed spotlight switching to characters not about to enter action/combat mode get to finish up the thing they were doing, as appropriate. Or at least get to a reasonable stopping point. To me, that's just being fair to non-action oriented PCs, right? I guess it just seems a bit unfair to me to have every other player get their stuff regularly vetoed or interrupted by a trigger happy PC.<br/><br/>[ I might take another look at the Doctor Who RPG for ideas on this point]<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Simplified measuring and ranges</span><br/><br/>I actually do very much like the idea of what someone suggested upthread of making this more about rolls to accomplish something, rather than strict measurements.<br/><br/>OTOH, I also feel like some sort of measure is important, just to keep players from either entirely overstepping expectations or worse, trying something really beyond my vision of reasonable and falling flat on their face if they fail the roll.<br/><br/>Right now I'm thinking about stealing from a couple minis games and just declaring a fairly liberal straight line move radius (probably 12"), with terrain impacting this, perhaps being "sticky" in some fashion, rather than being a move cost doubling/tripling effect.<br/><br/>Ranged fire I'm still muddling through, although I may go with 12" for that as well, and then just work in other sorts of mods by weapon type and terrain/Line of sight/line of fire issues.<br/><br/>For encounter area size, I think I have two workable approaches, depending on what I have to work with and travel issues.<br/><br/>At home I have fold out tables that are 2.5' x 6', with fold in the middle. If I'm going all out minis and 3d terrain crazy, I'll gear encounter areas/locales to one half of a table ( I have three tables total). That gives me easily 4 locales (2.5 x 3') with my apartment space or 6 locales with some creative arrangement. That should be plenty for an evening of gaming.<br/><br/>For away gaming and a more traditional situation of players sitting around a largish dining table, I'm just going primarily 2d ( with perhaps spot terrain added as desired) and drawn or printed stuff on sheets of 20" x 30" foamcore as the standard. This is close to the sixe of the above mentioned locales, and should fit easily in the center of a table.<br/><br/>The plan here is to build a library of common locales and make scenario specific locales as needed, then just throw all of it in a cardstock art portfolio to carry to game night.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21296/minis-can-someone-give-me-a-synopsis-of-how-fate-games-use-sketch-maps-and-zones" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21296/minis-can-someone-give-me-a-synopsis-of-how-fate-games-use-sketch-maps-and-zones" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21296/minis-can-someone-give-me-a-synopsis-of-how-fate-games-use-sketch-maps-and-zones/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21296%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21296%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
