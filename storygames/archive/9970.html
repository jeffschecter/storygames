To me, it seems that most of indie games are sold online and those sold in retail are usually sold at specialized stores or at least in a section clearly marked "RPGs". In all of these situations, the customer already knows it's an RPG, because ALL books in this perticular context are RPGs. Am I wrong? Why does a cover need to signal that it's an RPG? I realize there are functional design issues here, but I think they need to be spelled out, but in a new thread.<br/><br/>Of course, a cover still needs to do many other things and it's certainly an important thing, as even in an online context, it's usually the first thing the customer sees. I want to keep this discussion open as to exactly what a cover needs to accomplish. Consider the above as a start-off point to the wider discussion of "What criteria should I use to decide wether my game has a good cover?".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221351/#Comment_221351" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T04:05:25+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  4:05AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good question.

He should ignore advice that points him in that direction, if that is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nCriteria for determining if your cover is good: Show it to people who may be in your target audience. Ask them for their first impressions. Ask them if they'd pick it up if they saw it on a shelf. If they would, why? If they wouldn't, why?<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously "church camp pamphlet" isn't what Marcus was going for. Moving away from that is definitely a good idea. Moving away from "Radiant" images is probably a bad idea. Showing people as the focus on the cover is also a bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer is too subjective to be simple.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221376/#Comment_221376" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T06:09:14+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  6:09AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cover design is an act of marketing.

The first involved a Kung Fu fight between two aerial figures silhouetted against a setting sun, with a wide-screen cinema-style crop against a black background. It was terrible for a lot of reasons: the figures were wearing tight-fitting clothes evocative of a completely different type of action movie, the photo wasn't that high quality, the initial title was in Japanese instead of Chinese. It might have been more accessible to some people than the final product-- the first versions did, in fact, also have the title in English on it as well-- but it wasn't doing its job. So I sat down to figure out what would best communicate what the book was about.<br><br>It was steeped in Chinese culture, evocative of movies like House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower, it was by Shreyas so it was a little weird and artsy and maybe kind of pretentious. It takes a higher buy-in, I think, to play a game where you threaten your friends at knifepoint than it does to play Exalted, so if some people were turned off by the lack of English on the front that was fine with us. I mocked up a couple similar covers, and we eventually went with the gold leaf and floral seal because it fit everything on the checklist: you looked at the cover and went "Oh, it's Chinese, and kind of reminds me of Curse of the Golden Flower (if you're familiar with it anyway), and WTF? Where's the English? What kind of artsy crap is this?" and then you turn it over to get your answer. But then, by that point, it's already in your hands.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221384/#Comment_221384" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T06:50:38+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  6:50AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ::faints::                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221390/#Comment_221390" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T07:18:36+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  7:18AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To continue what Guy, Lance say:<br><br>In my opinion, the author has total agency when it comes to the cover of their book.

So start by figuring out what kind of an indie game you want to make and how you want it to operate in the marketplace.  There's a big difference between <em>Spirit of the Century</em> and <em>Sea Dracula</em>, for instance.<br/><br/>One generality I'm willing to make is that 90% or more of indie game sales happen online.  If that will follow for your book, then this has massive repercussions for how you design your cover.  You need a (front) cover that looks good as a thumbnail.  (See my games for how <em>not</em> to do this \u2014 too many images, too busy, and as a thumbnail everything gets squashed into an unrecognizable mess, especially <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16489" rel="nofollow">SoL</a>.)  The back cover may not appear online <em>at all</em>, and your potential customers will be deciding whether or not to pick it up without the information provided there.  <em>Don't</em> think about your marketing in terms of standing out on a shelf; think of your marketing in terms of standing out on an index page and looking good and intriguing and what-have-you as a webpage.<br/><br/>However, all that said, remember that your prime vector of advertisement is probably going to be word of mouth.  Most people will hear of your game from other people who have bought your game.  Many people will see your game for the first time at a convention or on a friend's bookshelf, and that is where the physicality of your book and its cover come into play.  The back cover copy matters here \u2014 and knowing that, you can write copy geared towards getting readers to ask their friends, the people who have already bought a copy, leading questions.  The bar is also higher, here, because your potential customers are not at the point of sale.  You need to make an impression that lasts until they get to a computer to order your book, which is no small thing.<br/><br/>But, again, all that may or may not be true for your game.  You need to figure out how your game will interact with potential customers.  Until you do that, you <em>cannot</em> make good, deliberate, and informed decisions about how your cover will sell your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221431/#Comment_221431" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T10:32:52+00:00" title="July 29, 2009 10:32AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent points, Josh.

If there's something that could be a PC on the cover (or a scene from a game), that's nice too.  I don't mind fannish art but I draw the line at actively bad art on the cover.  Also, most of the time, overt sexiness is a bad idea IMO.  In general, I don't care for covers that I actively have to hide from my S.O. and kid because they're too explicit/violent/disturbing/tacky.  <br><br>As someone who's read science fiction and fantasy for decades, I've noticed that the publishing companies do a good job of making different subgenres of books distinct -- you can tell a Baen Books military science fiction thriller from a Tor literary science fiction novel from a giant fantasy series novel just by looking at the design, not even reading the title or author.  This would be a useful thing for game designers to do, although indie games have a sort of style-of-no-style by virtue of their diversity.<br><br>About whether to have "game" on the cover -- I don't think it's mandatory, but it helps.  There are lots of supplements, army lists, comic books, etc. that get sold in many game stores and they also have brightly colored genre art on their covers.  Also, you can add some descriptors, like how the old Vampire game had "A roleplaying game of personal horror" on the cover.  That may not have been true, but it was good marketing.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221519/#Comment_221519" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T18:55:17+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  6:55PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think games need covers.<br><br>I'm indier than all of you now.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/threegee" title="threegee"><img alt="threegee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/threegee">threegee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221528/#Comment_221528" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T19:38:58+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  7:38PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite format is half-letter, saddle-stitched, with a b&amp;w on colored cover-stock cover.

It may be useful to take a look at these - it's the evolution of the cover I just finished for Dev Purkayashthas <a href="http://games.forgreatjustice.net/my-games/the-dance-and-the-dawn/" rel="nofollow">The Dance and the Dawn</a> (full disclosure, I am also publishing it).<br/><br/>First attempt: trying to incorporate the chess theme and the dawn theme.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/files/2009/08/dntdcover1.jpg" width="400"/><br/><br/>Notice that it's very "flat", theres not a lot of texture to the composition - just an image on a black background with some text. There's a little tension between the content of the text and the image, but there's not a lot to grab the viewer. Chess? Dancing? What?<br/><br/>Second attempt: relegating the chess theme to the back cover, trying to communicate the feel of the game.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/files/2009/08/dntdcover2.jpg" width="400"/><br/><br/>Better. You play fairy-tale princesses in this game, at the Isles of Ice and Ash, so this version centers on a "here's the kind of character you play" treatment. Unfortunately, I couldn't find an image that think really fit. This was the closest, but it's more alien than I would really like. There's more going on compositionally, with the different color bars and the text straddling the different "zones," but it still felt too cold and alien for a game that, at it's heart, is about finding true love.<br/><br/>And here's the final:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/files/2009/08/frontcover.jpg" width="400"/><br/><br/>I'm really happy with it. The image of the masks really nails the feeling I was going for, and paired with the title fufills the "dance" theme. The black-and-white treatment echoes the chess theme, and the white space keeps an attachment to the ice/dawn theme. <br/><br/>Note that these are the hilights of 5 or so different color/image/composition attempts.<br/><br/>I feel that a cover needs to communicate the themes and feel of a game, so that if someone is drawn in by the cover, they will also be receptive the game inside. My process is usually to identify the feel, and then grind away at it until I hit on elements that work, and than keep recombining them until I'm happy with it. I hope this helps give some insight into that process!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221935/#Comment_221935" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T11:02:16+00:00" title="August  1, 2009 11:02AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see, putting my gaming experiences aside, let me trot out my bookselling experience of 5 years. After working in every aspect of a big bookstore, let me say that EVERYONE judges a book by a cover. And the weird thing is, that usually IS a good indicator of the quality of the book. Now I'm not saying that there aren't good quality games or novels that have crap covers, we all know that there are. But after handling I don't know how many thousands of books, the cover can tell me almost right away two things: do the authors/publishers care about the cover, and do they know what they are doing? <br/><br/>I'm being a bit snobby here, so bare with me, but when a book or game has a bad/cheesy cover, it makes me think: "Well, if they don't put the time, care, or talent into the cover, why would they put it into the content?" Writers or designers don't have to be graphic artists or designers, but they should AT LEAST recognize if they have that weakness. After all, if they cannot recognize their weaknesses here, would they be able to recognize their weaknesses in their writing or design?<br/><br/>I guess I'm just sick of seeing crap or amateur covers and then discovering the same thing inside.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221942/#Comment_221942" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T11:57:23+00:00" title="August  1, 2009 11:57AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with everybody named Josh, especially on the need for covers that look good in thumbnails and strong, striking images.

The black and white is very striking, the title is clear, the proportions are excellent and the way the white bleeds into the tentacles to look like it's back-lit is very evocative. Good job!<br/><br/>Also, this is a great thread for people to post their covers and talk about what they were thinking. Here's the cover for my latest game:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://urverkspel.com/images/stories/detsjatteinseglet/framsida.jpg"/><br/><br/>Thoughts: The game had a production time of 22 hours from first concept to being sold in a store (well, lulu), so this was my first and only cover, though I tinkered a bit with it. The image is something I did for another project that never got finished, but I finished it now. It lacked something eye-catching and evocative, though it has some atmosphere, so I took a picture of a rapier and added the blood. The genre of the game is "Swashbuckling angst", and I think it communicates it decently well, though "angst" is hard to communicate.<br/><br/>What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222240/#Comment_222240" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T12:16:17+00:00" title="August  3, 2009 12:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Joshua: That forum is a great idea.

I'm not talking about you. I don't know you at all. I'm talking about this:</p>\n<p>I see a lot of requests for critique on Story Games. I see a lot of responses to those requests. I don't see much critique.</p>\n<p>That's not an indictment of Story Games by any means. I like it here. I like the Zen. I like finding out about new things, I like shooting the shit. I like the resultant get-togethers and the occasional creative frenzy.</p>\n<p>But none of its mandate has to do with critique. Preferences, idle opinion, and occasional casual spite all masquerade as honesty. When real critique happens, it's in an environment that isn't safe for it and therefore isn't productive.</p>\n<p>This thread was <em>not</em> asking for critique. People have put their covers up as <em>examples</em>. They're saying, "This is what I did in this situation." Nathan showed his process (which is pretty neat). Jonathan showed the next version of his cover (which is neat by itself). Simon showed something that he'd made under extraordinary time pressure and <em>did</em> ask what people think;</p>\n<p>... but here's the thing: when someone asks me what I think about something, before I even look at it, I need to know what they want. Do they want me to say, "Cool!" and just be as honestly enthusiastic as I can be? Do they want to know if the content communicates what they're trying to communicate? Do they want to know how to make something work typographically? If I think they've done an A- job and they could do an A+ job if they solved certain problems, should I say that?</p>\n<p>"What do you think?" <em>might</em> be a request for critique. But it's certainly not clear, and I'm not going to risk being a douche to someone who's put a piece of theirs in the public eye by telling them my carefully considered opinions that may require them starting over if they're to be followed. Because that kind of response would be extraordinarily rude outside of a critique situation, I made a new situation.</p>\n<p>The situation is that, if you actually want to critique and have your work critiqued in an environment that is safe and productive, go over to the Game Design Studio. The responses will be moderated to encourage them to be thoughtful, productive <em>questions</em> backed by considered <em>observations</em>.</p>\n<p>We'll see how it works! If it doesn't, we won't do it. But I've seen an awful lot of pleas around here for <a href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/forum/game-design-studio/how-to-critique/" rel="nofollow">such a thing</a>. If you've got something you want to make better, try it out. I've been getting signups all afternoon. There are some wise people putting their names down in the member list. They want to help.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222299/#Comment_222299" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T15:41:09+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  3:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I was specifically called out here... right now I'm not necessarily seeking feedback or critique (which, like Joshua says, are often two different things from two different audiences) but I'm always open to it, so no harm done.

It's definitely going to be tightened up before anything serious happens.  And when I do eventually seek out real critique, it'll be from specific people whose aesthetic judgment I trust and also with whom I can clearly communicate about aesthetic matters (which can be really hard, since a lot of folks have good instincts but find it harder to talk about why they feel certain ways or are folks that I just don't have the past history with to be able to decipher their comments).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222314/#Comment_222314" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T17:36:06+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  5:36PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

If you have an obvious subdivision (like Jonathan has) then the best way to find it is to divide the format into eight sections, then put the subdivision on the fifth division up/third division down. <br/><br/>There's a really simplified version of it that amateur photographers use called "the rule of thirds" where you mentally divide your picture plane into a tic-tac-toe board and place important things on the lines and intersections. Most decent digital cameras even have digital overlays for both "rule of thirds" and "golden section" built in, but you usually have to go poking around in the menus.<br/><br/>A lot of time I'll use a Fibonacci scale in my designs. I'll chose a unit of measurement (say 12 pixels) and then everything (sizes, distances, x-height, leading or point sizes) is a multiple of the Fibonacci series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, etc... If I have a lot to work with, then I'll add another scale with based on a half-unit (6 points).<br/><br/>EDIT: After you get past 5:8 in the Fibonacci series, the ratios of adjacent numbers more closely approximate the golden ratio, but 5:8 is really damn close for practical purposes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222455/#Comment_222455" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T12:00:02+00:00" title="August  4, 2009 12:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, reading those books by Itten and Albers and Muller- Brockmann really opened things up for me.

The Grid is just a way of "mathing out" some of those choices in a meter that is compelling to the eye.  By picking Thirds or the Golden Mean you are taking a classical proportion that has a long history in art and letting that meter help you position your elements.<br><br>Some good monographs on Tschichold and Muller-Brockman will actually breakdown the final designs and show you how they fit into a particular meter.  The best you can hope to walk away from that is figuring out the way in which the designer balanced those materials.  And with that, you will begin to educate yourself on 2d design.<br><br>this is an excellent book on the topic: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Systems-Graphic-Systeme-Visuele-Gestaltung/dp/3721201450" rel="nofollow">Grid System in Graphic Design</a><br><br>here's an interview with <a href="http://www.thegridsystem.org/2009/articles/interview-with-khoi-vinh/" rel="nofollow">Khoi Vihn</a> that may give you some perspective on grid application.<br/><br/>and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_%28page_layout%29" rel="nofollow">wiki</a> on grid design, with some links and resources within.<br/><br/>a five part article on <a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five_simple_steps_to_designing_grid_systems_part_1/" rel="nofollow">"how to"</a> design them.<br/><br/>and a <a href="http://www.gridsystemgenerator.com/" rel="nofollow">Grid System Generator</a><br/><br/><br/>this "should" make for fairly dull reading but it's the exciting underbelly behind dynamic and harmonious layout.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Plus, the dude in that article still says that "nature favors the Golden Ratio, just not exclusively so." It's a remarkable thing. It's just not the <em>only</em> remarkable thing. The Universe is, after all, <em>really big</em>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222467/#Comment_222467" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T13:06:27+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  1:06PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lance, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rectangle" rel="nofollow">the Golden Rectangle</a> instead.

The article seems to <i>confirm</i> the appearance of the golden ratio in nature. To be fair, he does point out that it's far from universal, and there are other algorithms present in nature, and that the Nautilus shell so often cited is actually not an example of the GR. More to the topic of this thread, however, he does point out that his surveys have failed to verify that there is any specific type of rectangle that is visually more pleasing than another. In addition, he does refute the idea that it has historically been used much in art and architecture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222578/#Comment_222578" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T20:25:01+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  8:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There have been several studies where people have been shown a selection of rectangles, and the overwhelming majority of them chose the Golden Rectangle as the most pleasing.
