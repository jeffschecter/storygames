How did it fall flat for you?<br/><br/>For me, having players play NPCs, and major NPCs, has become one of the most simple yet (for me) revolutionary things that has happened at the table in my gaming, ever (came from lessons in the With Great Power book). <br/><br/>As GM, I'll maybe have a scene where one PC is in it, with another major/minor NPC. Normally this is played by the GM. Recently, I've been handing these out to the players to play, often leaving me (the GM) with no "set character" in the scene, and just watch it unfold.  if the NPC has somethign they need to say or do to "advance the plot" (or do something cool on my notecards), I'll briefly take control of the character, then hand them back to the player.<br/><br/>If I'm playing with new players (like the last two Tenra games I ran at GenCon this year), I'll tell them that I'd like them to participate even in scenes where they're not there.<br/><br/>Then, when the time comes, I'll do something like this:<br/>The scene in this case is a monk basically leaving his order, but first going in front of an audience of elder monks, to basically get chewed out.<br/>I had the player enter the scene in character, and I (the GM) took on the role of the "head monk", and asked a poignant question or two in character.<br/>Then, out of character, I say, "The monk sitting to the elder's right has been staring at you with a contemptuous glare all this time. He opens his mouth to speak. Alright, then, what does the monk say?" I then lightly point to one of the other players who aren't in the scene, usually starting with a player who seems either really attentive, or really extroverted (someone who looks like they'll basically jump well to being put under the gun like this). <br/>That person jumps in in-character with a question for the player.<br/>I'll say something like, "The monk to the elder's left also has something to say. What does she say?" And point to someone else.<br/><br/>This is how to get the simple level of players taking on NPCs.  However, don't expect the players to simply jump in without being prodded. I usually have to point to get people to "tap in", but once they do they tap in willingly, quickly pick up a role, and they're on fire.<br/><br/>I love how this works in play, because the controlled chaos almost always gives me, as GM, ideas of new directions to go in the adventure.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177715/#Comment_177715" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T13:32:15+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  1:32PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so the above example I gave was fairly typical for "adventure" style scenarios: Run from place to place doing things, no real strong stable of major NPCs that matter, etc. For scenarios or games which have a strong stable of major NPCs (like my recent L5R game, or With Great Power, or maybe a game like Vampire), I basically do the same as the above: I might already have a "template" or "idea" of a major NPC (their name, rank, major powers, etc). But just like the above, I'll ask someone to take up that role, usually by simply pointing at them.<br/><br/>From that point on, I usually have that player "own" that NPC's role. On sheets listing the NPCs, I usually write "Played by: X" (where X is the player's name of the player who played him/her the most). Some times, of course, more than one person will take on a given role (frex, I tap Tim to take on the role of Dracula most of the time, because in the first scene where Dracula was introduced, Tim's character wasn't there. Later, Tim's character talks to Dracula; I could take on that role of Dracula as GM, but it's fun to give to yet another player instead). But having at least a little ownership over those NPCs seems to work the best, in my experience.<br/><br/>Any questions on the above?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177716/#Comment_177716" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T13:32:42+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  1:32PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love doing this and I make it work by playing with really great people.  Usually I can say "Robo, play his aunt Marfa" and Robo will run with it to somewhere unexpected.<br/><br/>Occasionally I'll tap somebody and give them a particular bit of business, like "Robo, play his aunt Marfa.  Biba paid her a visit and she's scared" or "Robo, play his aunt Marfa.  Get him to quit the criminal life."  Not too much, but maybe the kernel of where I'd take the scene if I were playing them.  <br/><br/>Either way, you need to trust them to be awesome and open to things going in new directions as they build on whatever relationship they've been thrust into.  Keeping the assignations flying is a good way to counter any plot-controlling tendencies you might have.  In a long term game, these assignments turn into recurring roles - Robo <i>is </i>aunt Marfa, whenever she shows up, and that's understood.  He may just roll with it, or he may actively develop her story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177717/#Comment_177717" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T13:48:27+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  1:48PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2008 2:33PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The times I've liked playing a stand-in NPC had one or more of these features:<br/><br/>* I knew what my part in the scene was -- I was told up front what the general goal, either out-of- or in-character, was.  If I was playing the shyster lawyer, I was going to be offering money to make a witness go away.  If I was the squad's Fucking New Guy, I was going to freak out when the shooting started.  If I was the older brother, I was going to have a hard time believing my little sister's crazy story about her superpowers.<br/><br/>* I didn't get the NPC role randomly, I was typecast for it.  My gaming group's been together a long time, so we all kind of know who our "go-to" people for certain character types are.  So when NPCs are handed around, I get the lion's share of the academics, a fuckton of sleazy low-echelon criminals, and most of the slackers; those are the NPCs I'm handed, because I can jump right into character immediately and I know how to have fun playing them.  I don't get handed the no-nonsense hero types, sadistic torturers, or religious zealots, because I don't really enjoy those roles and everyone knows it.<br/><br/>* It was a dialogue-heavy scene rather than an action-heavy one.  My job playing the NPC was to talk, and talk, and talk some more; if I had to roll any dice at all, it was infrequent and the NPC's success or failure had little to no impact on anything I personally cared about as a player.  If all I'm doing is proxy dicerolling for the GM, there's really no point in my being handed the part: just go ahead and make a table of two dozen die rolls and read 'em off as you go, you don't need any input from me.<br/><br/>* If I needed to know details about something, I either had them given to me earlier, knew them myself already, or was reassured as to how far I could go making stuff up without inadvertently trashing something that the GM wanted to do.  (Good constraints are important to me!)<br/><br/>* NPC stand-ins were used mostly when the session demanded that one PC get a lot of attention and trying to shoehorn in everyone's PC was going to be problematic.  They were short-term assignments, generally one or two scenes in a four-hour session at most, and never in more than a handful of non-consecutive sessions in any given campaign.  (We've also spent entire sessions where everyone played a stand-in the entire time, as a kind of one-shot insert into an ongoing game, which is a lot of fun but not the same as playing an NPC stand-in.)<br/><br/>* Also, the fun NPC stand-ins were the ones that were different from my PC.  If I'm already playing a slacker PC, I don't want to play a slacker NPC.  (In fact, I may not even want there to <i>be</i> a slacker NPC to play in the first place -- if you need a slacker in the scene, why isn't it my character?)  If I'm playing a quiet and polite PC, I don't want to play a quiet and polite NPC.  If I'm playing a loudmouth jerk PC, I don't want the loudmouth jerk NPC.  I look at playing a stand-in as a little mini-vacation from what I've been doing during the rest of the game, and part of that is keeping my "NPC moonlighting" as different from my "PC day job" as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177745/#Comment_177745" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T20:59:16+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  8:59PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to add something, but Andy and Jason covered everything I do for this when GMing.

The little note was more common, because our usual GM liked doing that kind of prep work and thinking ahead about things like whether or not NPC stand-ins would be a good idea in the upcoming session.  We never did this off the cuff or on a whim, it was always for a reason -- I suspect because playing NPCs is one of the great joys of GMing, and therefore not something you'd want to give up without a good reason.<br/><br/>Another technique we tried with some success was to assign players to handle NPC friends and associates for other PCs, and that was handled waaaay back during character creation, by offering up lists of those NPCs and seeing if any of them struck a chord with other players.  If they did, then the PC's player and the newly-elected NPC players would hash out some basic notes (personality, some history, etc.) and go from there.  (I think we actually stole this idea from how we used to play Wraith.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177779/#Comment_177779" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T10:52:50+00:00" title="November  8, 2008 10:52AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you give an example of the kinds of things that the GM told you prior to playing an NPC, and which worked and which didn't work so well?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177787/#Comment_177787" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T12:47:46+00:00" title="November  8, 2008 12:47PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2008 12:55PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually did in my first post, but I'll expand on them a bit for you:<br/><br/>I was asked to play the shyster lawyer at the start of a scene in a police station, and told that my gangland clients would be willing to pay a lot of money to have a witness taken care of (along with a ballpark figure for how high they'd go), and that we knew about the PC detective's gambling debts.  I pulled the PC detective aside and danced around the subject of money and how inconvenient this witness was, and the other player obligingly asked straight up if I was asking him to murder a witness.  My NPC lawyer was shocked -- no, APPALLED -- at the suggestion, because that would be ILLEGAL and not something I wanted to hear any details about, but that nevertheless, both the gambling debts and the witness remained problems, and if the latter stopped being one, then the former would as well.  Message delivered, the lawyer's job was done and I was out of the scene.<br/><br/>In a PC's black-ops flashback scene, I had the mini-character sheet, a very simple description of the NPC, and one recommended action to perform during the scene.  He's the FNG on the squad, talks a good game but has never really been in the shit before, and is not really cut out for this line of work.  My job was mostly to freak the hell out when bullets started flying and to open the door (literally, in this case) for the near-TPK that convinced the PC to strike off on his own.  Other players had other roles on the squad, from "crusty old veteran" to "half-drunk demolitions expert," and in some cases had their own recommended action (the vet shoving the PC out the exit first, so that he wouldn't die at the end of the scene, etc.).  That was a fairly tightly choreographed scene all the way around, but let the PC's player show off some of the PC's background and let us add some fun details to it that he would refer back to in later sessions.<br/><br/>When a player's teenage PC started being able to predict the future and slow down time, she confided in her older brother.  All I had was "he's a pot-smoking video store clerk and thinks she's pretty cool," but that was enough to know that he'd scoff at her story until she demonstrated it, and then when he was convinced he'd start riffing on movies and asking increasingly stupid questions, so that we could get some fun banter about being superpowered going on.<br/><br/><br/>Fortunately, I haven't had any genuinely terrible experiences with playing an NPC stand-in.  Probably the closest was a few slightly-miscast ones (character types I don't like playing -- nothing wrong with them, they just aren't fun and I didn't enjoy being them for a scene), and one time when an NPC I was playing was asked a question that I as a player didn't know the answer to and the GM suddenly realized "oh fuck, he'd know the answer to that" and had to jump in with the appropriate exposition.  Those could've been planned better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177795/#Comment_177795" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T14:45:05+00:00" title="November  8, 2008  2:45PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2008 2:46PM by Mike_Sands.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As GM, if I ask someone to play an NPC, I'll usually make it clear whether it's a case of "do whatever you want with the character" or "here's the one main thing about this character."<br/><br/>The first case, where the character is colour, is really just a way to share out the NPC-playing around the group. I usually use that when there's more than one NPC who will be actively engaging the PCs.<br/><br/>In the second case, the main thing could be:<br/>- A relationship with an important character in the game<br/>- A clue that they need to give the PCs<br/>- Something they want from the PCs<br/>(There's probably others, that's all I can think of right now)<br/><br/>In both cases, this one basic idea is usually enough to carry a character for a scene. Sometimes we'll return to the same NPCs and they'll grow to be deeper over time.<br/><br/>So, my typical setup for this would be something like:<br/><br/>Me: "Okay, so you and you are going to ask the grants committee for money for your expedition. I'll play the chairman, you and you can be other members of the committee. Think up a name and basic thing for each guy. The chair, Professor Wilberforce, is known for his stinginess in all areas except his own department, Literature"<br/>J: "Professor Argyll is obsessed with quantum physics and pays no attention to other topics"<br/>S: "Doctor Smith is senile"<br/>... the hearing begins...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
