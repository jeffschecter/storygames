A Monster lives in the woods nearby, who takes you on Adventures to cheer you up. Many spirits live in the woods.<br/><br/>You are a Neko (Patient 3, Determined 2, Reliable 1), Tanuki (Determined 3, Reliable 2, Patient 1) or a Kitsune (Reliable 3, Patient 2, Determined 1)<br/><br/>These are your Virtues.<br/><br/>Doing your Chores and going on Adventures require Checks. Roll 1d10+Virtue. 8+: you succeed.<br/><br/>Each Check is tied to a Virtue. <br/><br/>Example: cooking requires Patience.<br/><br/>You must do one chore before going out to Adventure, or more to be helpful.<br/><br/>For each Check, you spend one Wakefulness. When you have spent 10, you fall asleep. In the morning, you regain all Wakefulness.<br/><br/>The spirits Favour you for doing your chores. Gain 2 Favour per Chore. Favour lets you reroll a Check, without getting more tired.<br/><br/>You gain one Sorrow each day. If you complete an Adventure before bedtime, the Monster eats one Sorrow.<br/><br/>If all Sorrow is below the number of Children * 2 after 5 days, then Haha comes home. If not, then Chichi (Daddy) has bad news.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453428/#Comment_453428" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-21T08:49:57+00:00" title="May 21, 2016  8:49AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I \u2665 Tonari no Totoro <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Do you want to retain the 200-word format, or are you looking to expand beyond it?<br/><br/>IMO, the most important thing which doesn't fit in the current format (but you might find ways to hint at it) is: who plays the Monster and the various spirits?

I pruned the idea down about as small as I could to get it to fit into the 200 words. <br/><br/>I didn't have space to talk about who has what permissions. Given it is meant to be a DM'ed game, I thought that base line assumptions would carry it. <br/><br/>In version 2, I will be covering these areas.<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>Haha (Mummy)</blockquote>\nNot much of a fan of using Japanese words for non-culture-specific, common everyday concepts, but that's just me.

For me, it is very important that it be set in Japan. I had a like two words left. I wanted to reinforce the Japanese setting elements. <br/> <br/>Mommy is a literal translation of Haha, but like a lot of Japanese language, their is baggage attached. It's use tell the reader something about the tone of the game, about the age of the characters. Lots of meaning wouldn't really have carried over if I had used Mother or Father, or Mommy and Daddy.  <br/>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>You are a Neko (Patient 3, Determined 2, Reliable 1), Tanuki (Determined 3, Reliable 2, Patient 1) or a Kitsune (Reliable 3, Patient 2, Determined 1)</blockquote>\nAt first I thought you meant it literally, like in Golden Sky Stories, but then it wouldn't make much sense, right?

That is however a much better wording, and I think I will probably steal it, if you'll let me.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eris_Shrugged" title="Eris_Shrugged"><img alt="Eris_Shrugged" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eris_Shrugged">Eris_Shrugged</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453432/#Comment_453432" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-21T12:44:20+00:00" title="May 21, 2016 12:44PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm going to write short and it might come out blunt because of that.<br/><br/>If judging if this was a 200 Word submission, what you created was mostly a rule system with some flavor attached to it.

I mean, I'm not sure I've got that right because maybe the GM is running the monster, the spirits, chichi etc. &lt;- Whoops, I missed that you wrote to Rafu that there &lt;i&gt;is a GM. Would not have guessed that.<br/>The only real choice you can make as far as I can see is whether or not to perform more chores beyond the first.<br/>Not sure how many checks are involved in each chore and each adventure.<br/><br/>I'm guessing, and this is something I <i>really</i> was missing from the text, that you make up things to say in character or to say about what your character is doing around the house and in the spirit wood with the monster, and then say those made up things, and only when you say something chore- or adventure- related, you make checks.<br/>But then I'm again left confused with how many checks are needed to fully resolve an adventure in order for the monster to make you less sad (the "eat sorrow" is a bit of a writer's darling, it's not the most clear.<br/><br/>So the structure is:<br/>Everyone make characters with those three options.<br/>Everyone start talking about how they're going on about the house, cooking, cleaning etc. Making up their own minds about what virtue is relevant to what check.<br/>And then after at least one maybe more chores have been talked about, then they switch to talking about how they go out to the spirit wood and play with the monster.<br/>And then ... here's where I'm really getting lost at what's going on. Are players saying things like "Then I meet this Fire Spirit and I have to help her find her Home in the Lantern" and "Oh but I meet this Acorn Guide that helps me find joy" and stuff? I mean...<br/>I don't know how it works!

Structure for the participants, not the characters.<br/><br/>For examples, look at the winners and almost all the finalists <a href="http://schirduans.com/david/2015/04/200-word-rpg-challenge.html" rel="nofollow">from last year</a>. LOVEINT is pretty close to your game, when it comes to how the structure could look like. <br/><br/>Here is a good example of one step in the structure of play from the 3rd place All Fall Down: "Play in scenes. Shine the spotlight. Everything is broken. There is never enough. Everyone is desperate."<br/><br/>It not only tells what to do but in what way to do it.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm also a little in love with the finalist Ring: telling the tales of trees. Be sure to also check out No Sleep Tonight, because note writing in advance could be a way of create tension through uncertainty, and it's something you could implement in your game - as a step in your structure of play. Notes used in that way not only brings uncertainty, but it's uncertainty from the players instead of faceless randomness from dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453452/#Comment_453452" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-21T21:06:38+00:00" title="May 21, 2016  9:06PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have never written a finished game.

But it is also one where I think that the only working solution is to accept it is a game with niche appeal.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>That is however a much better wording, and I think I will probably steal it, if you'll let me.</blockquote>\nSure, go ahead and use it! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nThank you.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>Roll 1d10+Virtue. 8+: you succeed.</blockquote>\nThis is quite minor, but\u2026 why use a d10?

Probably because there are so many of the things floating around flat that they are just the thing that came to mind. it is something I can re-examine.\n<blockquote><br/>Is there any incentive to do things which don't fall under my best virtue? Chores, especially. Any reason three differently-natured children won't just divide up chores according to top virtue only, all the time, to maximize Favor gain? </blockquote>\nMechanically no. Not at the moment. However, children don't really get to choose their chores, they are a thing that is imposed on childhood. As such, their is no certainty that the PCs will get a set of chores which allign with their virtues. Since each player must do at least one chore, it likely thy might find that theirbis game in say minimising the negative effects of a bad selection of chores.<br/><br/><br/> Version 2 is going to have a chore deck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453469/#Comment_453469" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-22T09:41:23+00:00" title="May 22, 2016  9:41AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the d10 over 8 rule, it makes it easy to see percentage chances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
