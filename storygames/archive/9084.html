Back before my blackout, I vaguely remember Jonathon Walton (or maybe Emily Care... or maybe someone else) positing the idea as a hypothetical. Has "structured freeform" actually become a "thing" now? I can guess what the term refers to, but I would rather hear what people mean when they say it.

The big push in the US came when Emily, Jason, and some other folks started really getting into Jeepform and related Nordic traditions like Danish scenario-style play.  But there's some other stuff that had been peculating before, like some of my previous contest games and some largely under-appreciated design work by other folks.  Elizabeth Shoemaker's <i>It's Complicated</i> is another game to add to Jason's list, coming from a completely different space than those others.<br/><br/>I expect we'll see a lot more of this stuff in the future, both in the form of Nordic-style convention scenarios and mini-larps and also in commercially published game books more in the traditional / indie tabletop style.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of games that are sitting on the boundaries between structured freeform and other play traditions, which I think often get overlooked in these conversations.  Stuff like Polaris, Mist-Robed Gate, Zombie Cinema and the like are pushing people in the direction of structured freeform and are important milestones.  Structured freeform isn't the promised land of design, after all.  It's just a set of tools that can be easily mixed with other kinds of non-freeform tools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200887/#Comment_200887" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T09:38:20+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  9:38AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2009 9:42AM by Brand_Robins.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm down with what Morningstar said. <br/><br/>I'd also add a lot of Jeeps to the element.

So you get Jeep-form bird-in-the-ear rather than fortune resolution, and guided rubrics for decision making rather than gambled narration rights, and so on. <br/><br/>But while that's a nice little theoretical definition, it still leaves me in accordance with the Morningstar's ven-diagram idea. Because some games that might not ever get called structured freeform could probably fit in there (Polaris comes damn close in most ways, for example), and some games that you'd think would don't -- for various reasons from community, marketing, and whatever. So what it is in the wild tends to be a little hard to pin down. <br/><br/>Kinda like roleplaying, I guess.

These aren't just freeform mechanics that are formalized over time, but ones that are explicit from the beginning of play.  Whether they are actually written down or not is another matter, I think.<br/><br/>Jason, there's Fortune in <i>Mare Caspium</i>, though, right?  And it's structured freeform.  I think the key to Fortune-use in structured freeform is that outcomes aren't mechanically determined.  Oracle-style uses of fortune to randomize creative constraints or inspirations are kosher, I think.  But this is a continuum, not a cut-and-dry case, because what is "rolling a failure" besides a randomized creative constraint, right? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Graham, none of the things you mentioned are inherant in structured freeform.  I'm not sure where you're getting that list, which looks much more Nordic / Jeep, which has more specific limitations that traditionally define that community of people and games.  On its own, "structured freeform" is an intentional general term, like the way Clinton originally used "story game" to include all RPGs, rather than the way the term is now used to define a specific scene.  If I were to lay out some general principles, I'd say:<br/><br/>* explicit mechanics,<br/>* no mechanical resolution of outcomes (i.e. freeform resolution).<br/><br/>Anything else is getting into specific design choices and play traditions within structured freeform.  And there are a bunch more besides Jeep.  There's also like <i>De Profundis</i>, Neel Krishnaswami's <i>Lexicon</i>, Dev's <i>The Dance and the Dawn</i> from Game Chef 2004, etc.<br/><br/>EDIT: Lord, okay, guess that term is now utterly useless.

I think Jason and I are on roughly the same page, definition-wise, though our interests are pretty different.  Other people are giving their own definitions, which are in many cases completely unrelated.  The term hasn't really grown to prominence except among a small subset of the indie community -- Western Mass, Boston, and Raleigh-Durham, basically, with a few outliers here and there -- so it's not surprising that people have their own ideas about what putting the words "structured" and "freeform" together means.<br/><br/>Eero, I view Zombie Cinema like I view Polaris, which is to say, you take out the die-roll for resolution and you have structured freeform.  Imagine a version of Zombie Cinema where you don't roll to determine who moves forward and backwards.  Instead, there's ritual negotiation ("But only if...") or some other formal process for determining the result or perhaps you just follow what happens in the fiction.

The fact that's there's no Fortune (as we use it vis a vis randomizers) is utterly orthogonal, to me, to the question of "what is 'freeform' and how can it gain the adjective modifier of 'structured.'" Sure, you can provide structure via a (simple, non-crunchy) Fortune mechanic, or it can be totally by use of a declaration mechanics and a pool of resources (a la Universalis), or the structure can only cover what's "suitable" for utterly free narration (i.e. he who speaks first states reality). Those are, to my reading of the phrase, different *types* of structure, not differing degrees of it.<br/><br/>But I haven't been in the freeform scene (far older than the indie scene which, apparently, put the term "structured" next to it); and I only know of LARP-like freeforms (some Jeep, some as ancient and venerable as cowboys and indians). The less structured, the more conflicts (actual inter-player disagreement as to narrative direction) are resolved by First To Speak or by Loudest To Speak.

Types seem to emerge as categories for things with some commonality (but, obviously, not utter parity). Dice games are conflict or risk games with resolution systems. Board games are dice games with more tactical choices. RPGs are board games with more creative choices. LARPs are RPGs with more of both types of choices.

And Jason's saying: yeah, that's not true for all structured freeform games, but most head in that direction.<br/><br/>It sounds, too, as though there's more emphasis on roleplaying scenes out, rather than driving for a conflict and resolving it. I'm thinking of Jason's Fiasco, which does have a way of resolving scenes (you're given a black or white die), but the roleplay before the resolution is the important bit.<br/><br/>And it sounds like there's not a strict dividing line between structured freeform and other games, but structured freeform games emphasise certain things more.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200946/#Comment_200946" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T12:51:34+00:00" title="April  6, 2009 12:51PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think right now, the Massachusetts Mafia are the only folks explicitly using the term and attaching it to a specific design aesthetic, so I guess if you're looking for an authoritative definition, Jonathan's the guy.<br/><br/>My "structured freeform" was an organic thing that grew out of very early cargo-cult RPG play, and coalesced into "structured" after I got some improv in my head. We used fortune-as-oracle a lot, actually, and sometimes as resolution (but only as "pick one at random out of several possible outcomes" resolution, not stakes-y stuff). The main things were strong prior constraints and very heavy use of tropes/genre trappings. And no, not especially immersive character-viewpoint. Very Director-ish a lot of the time, and plenty of out-of-band.<br/><br/>But definitely not structured as explicitly as what Jonathan is describing, no. Our structures were there, and we could definitely explicate them in detail (and did, over lots of coffee at Perkins many nights), but they weren't generally explicit in the sense of known ahead of time as a formal "thing." They consisted more of some general principles of how you do things and aesthetic preferences. Really, a lot of trial and error in earlier freeform-y games, leading to the evolution of some repeatable techniques and guiding concepts that resulted in higher quality experiences.<br/><br/>Tim, are you more interested in "here's this thing so-and-so did, that seems like it would combine freeform with structure", or "what's this school of design using the term think it encompasses"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200947/#Comment_200947" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T12:52:30+00:00" title="April  6, 2009 12:52PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, yeah, something like that.  There are other edge-cases too.  Like, uh, Nobilis or Amber, where you have Karma resolution through resource manipulation and comparing numbers, which still gives you formal resolution, but doesn't use dice.  In my experience, these feel more like structured freeform but the fact that they still have formal resolution makes them somewhat different still.  And Everway, which gave us the Fortune/Karma/Drama split, ranges all over the place because you can use whichever form of resolution you like for any given circumstance.<br/><br/>It's no coincidence, I think, that traditional tabletop freeform play (which is way different from larp freeform play or online freeform play or scenario-style freeform play) tends to be associated with certain games whose formal rules are often discarded in favor of less formal resolution.  In my experience, some games take play groups "halfway there" kinda, and then many groups take themselves "the rest of the way" to freeform.<br/><br/>But yeah, tabletop freeform play predates all of this stuff and is really a tradition of play without many explicit texts, because many if not most freeform tabletop players didn't write what they were doing down.  "Structured freeform," I recently discovered, was originally a term used to talk about a certain kind of Australian larp that combined tabletop elements with freeform larp.  But when I use it in reference to tabletop, I'm talking about tabletop freeform with explicit rules.  The terminology is all tricky and context-specific, though, which is partially why we're seeing confusion in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200951/#Comment_200951" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T13:04:31+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  1:04PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark: That sounds like what I would call "traditional tabletop freeform."  I don't really mean to imply that freeform play is without any structures at all.  I think most freeform play styles evolve out of the kind of cargo-cult stuff that you're talking about above.  And, yeah, many of the players involved can talk very explicitly about what they do.  And there are certainly implicit structures that are understood through practice and late-night coffee conversations.  To me, that's just how freeform works, based partially on stuff improvised during play and partially based on a shared understanding of how play is done.  Does that fit your experiences or are you talking about something different?  Are there ways in which your play is/was structured that go beyond the kinds of things you know occur in other freeform tabletop play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200954/#Comment_200954" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T13:09:47+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  1:09PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2009 1:15PM by Brand_Robins.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really, I think the etymological roots of the term have to do with some folks feeling that "freeform" meant "no rules." This often wasn't actually the case, as folks like Emily and John Kim and  many others often tried to describe, but the idea of freeform = just make it all up kinda stuck. Especially in groups that liked to have explicit structures and guiding mechanical resolution systems in their games. <br/><br/>Then came some movements like Jeep or some of Jonathan's tt "play by location" games where the games had rules, and structure, and defined play goals. However, they either lacked, or only lightly used the constrained, often mechanical, often fortune based resolution that was more or less the standard across a lot of table top games. Lots of people just called them "roleplaying games." Some called them "structured larps." Some in a specific scene started doing very specific things with them and called them "Jeep." <br/><br/>After that a bunch of people started playing Jeeps and the TT games that did things like this, and noticed that there were common elements between them. They wanted a way to talk about design and play around these common elements, and so they needed a term for it. I think "freeform" got chosen to designate the way that structure and process rather than mechanical resolution systems, harkening back to the "no dice" and "resolution is done by people rather than mechanics" elements of "freeform." "Structured" got chosen to differentiate it from the "make everything up" ideas about freeform, by specifically implying that this was a form of gaming that was highly structure based, and not something done ad-hoc or by rules that you had to guess at from group behaviors. <br/><br/>So when you come to the term from outside all that, yea... it seems weird. But considering the history of the discourse around freeform and structured game design (say, at the Forge) and the ways they overlapped, it does kinda make sense. Its just a term people started using to be like "we're doing this thing, that's kinda vague, but is cool, and we'd like to move forward with ideas about it." So making it into a prescriptive term is... uh... difficult, because that's not where the term is in its evolution yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200957/#Comment_200957" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T13:28:58+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  1:28PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Games Jonathan likes?"<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200960/#Comment_200960" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T13:36:01+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  1:36PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2009 1:36PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, I'm going to be in the same city as you soon.

I would put my more successful play at the "formal" level, and a lot of my formative (freeform) play at the "folk" level.<br/><br/>To respond to Jonathan's question above...<br/> Yeah, we're on the same page. I would say that if there's a major difference in culture-of-play that I've seen between my freeforming and other freeforming cultures-of-play that I've experienced, it's in two things, probably strongly interrelated.<br/><br/>1. Authorial relationship to the fiction - this seems to be a bit outlandish by the standards of many freeformers. The point of freeforming for many people I've talked to is intimately tied up with "immersion" in its many flavors, and our more dramaturgic approach to it turns a lot of people off. My play is more fanficcish and genre-savvy than many like. But those elements help make it work for us.<br/><br/>2. Heavy reliance on the players' familiarity with and use of genre tropes and structures. Where a lot of people are looking for nuance and complexity, we tend to go for the fanservice, blood-and-thunder, and old reliable plot contrivances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200969/#Comment_200969" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T13:53:00+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  1:53PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2009 1:56PM by Daniel H..">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>The fact that's there's no Fortune (as we use it vis a vis randomizers) is utterly orthogonal, to me, to the question of "what is 'freeform' and how can it gain the adjective modifier of 'structured.'" Sure, you can provide structure via a (simple, non-crunchy) Fortune mechanic, or it can be totally by use of a declaration mechanics and a pool of resources (a la Universalis), or the structure can only cover what's "suitable" for utterly free narration (i.e. he who speaks first states reality). Those are, to my reading of the phrase, different *types* of structure, not differing degrees of it.</blockquote>\nI'm not a LARP guy or a free-form guy, so take this with a grain of salt; to me, any kind of skill-based resolution, whether it is because of player skill or character skill, conflicts with my definition of free-form play, which looks at other factors to resolve situations. In your example, you mentioned that the "hit" player is under obligation to fall down and be removed from combat, which is much closer to the kind of behaviors that define free-form play than who is a better boffer-fighter.<br/><br/>They don't have to be mutually exclusive, obviously, but it was something that stood out in your example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200984/#Comment_200984" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T14:26:19+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  2:26PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Ben, I'm going to be in the same city as you soon.

One might narrate or collaborate upon any sort of Harry Potter story, with any sort of outcome, and gain unanimous agreement... until one narrates that Hermione goes down on Harry. Then all your players start to make a hew and fuss--you broke the "structure" by taking a fairly tapioca-pudding setting into Jamision's-shots reality. Structure = Setting<br/><br/>And that can happen if you have a mechanically enforced system (i.e. the "structure" comes from resolution methodologies, not notions of 'appropriateness,' whatever that might mean for the game type). So you are trying to push some storyline, but you're out of "trumps" or some sort of resource or mechanical leverage. So your narrative potential--even your acting (portrayal) potential--is constrained by the "structure" in the mechanics. Structure = System<br/><br/>But all that is easy with which to deal... because a rollicking freeform game can be found in simply engaging in R-Map Follies, pitting character against character. No, not competitively... more like 'raw' improv, where no one is trying to one-up, just get into character and see what happens. And playing "that" character means that you can't suddenly become "that other" character. Structure = Character<br/><br/>But, hell, I'm a bit on the wayward-side of this issue... not to mention a gallon-ish of brew-skewing.<br/><br/>I'll say it again: freeform is rules-less or rules-light; and structure is how color or setting or some other, relevant-but-orthogonal constraint is applied to what otherwise would be a game of "I Declare."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>I think maybe "flavors of freeform" is its own thread at this point, though.</blockquote>\nI vote for we make a wiki of simply game theory, in all its forms, with all if its syntactic evolutions.

Freeforms were the only kind of live action roleplaying I was exposed to in Sydney/Melbourne/Canberra when I first started going to cons, so my own games were heavily influenced by designers like Robert Pryor and Kyla Ward. I'm vaguely aware that boffer-style LRP was around in Australia somewhere, but Camarilla-style LARP hadn't made a big impact yet.<br/><br/>What Americans seem to think of as freeforming we just referred to as "systemless games".<br/><br/>Freeforms that I have played are usually not devoid of mechanics, but those rules are there to enable the live action roleplaying and only replace it when practicality demands. Where you need to draw this line varies enormously from game to game, which is where the term "freeform" becomes relevent. Designers, GMs, and players all become fairly adept at judging when you need to have a mechanic and when you don't.<br/><br/>A freeform game is like improvised jazz - there are rules but you follow them fairly liberally. Whereas a systemless game is more like a capella performance; without <i>any</i> musical accompaniment the singers actually need to be much more cooperative and know exactly how things are going to be resolved.<br/><br/>Kids playing Cops And Robbers (which is both freeform and systemless) is pretty much like kids just singing aloud... it very easily turns into pure noise. <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201052/#Comment_201052" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T04:56:25+00:00" title="April  7, 2009  4:56AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an AP.<br/><br/>We played ran a Harry Potter LARP at very short notice once. The GM didn't turn over so my wife and I volunteered to run something based on a what she'd written on piece of paper that was 60 miles away under our bed. All the players had character names, if not sheets, but for the other game.<br/><br/>Paula was McGonagall, I was Snape. We had a vague plot, snitch has been snitched it must be found. The group was divided into two. Paula took one class on a nature ramble. I took the other for potions. I walked up to the front, sneered at them a lot, was nasty to anyone not in Slitherin and gave them ten minutes to do their homework and left the room.<br/><br/>There were no rules as such for this part but when I came back Hufflepuff had invented a ritual and summoned Cthulhu. Some others had made potions. I gave out house points accordingly.<br/><br/>Later on we had a quidditch tournament. The rules as enunciated by one of the players were, 'We all fly round a lot, then Harry Potter wins.'<br/><br/>Then we had a hunt for the snitch involving snakes, whomping trees (GM standing on a chair) and other marvels.<br/><br/>And so it was, the narrative structure of the books provided the overarching structure of the game, i.e. stuff happens, HP wins. The important thing for us as refs was to focus on the stuff that happens and ensure it was fun. The players made sure that HP won. It could have been pure noise but it wasn't and is still fondly remembered by the players. I think part of the reason for this was that because the players were aware that they would be responsible for their own fun to a large extent. Many LARPS give the players lots of goals to achieve but we didn't do that. We had an overarching plot but the gaps had to be filled in with players defining where their characters stood in relation to each other and to make something of that. Obviously the fact that everyone was well aware of the source material made this easier.<br/><br/>And the one player who hadn't read HP got to be an exchange student, Sabrina the teenage witch, she had a voyage of discovery instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201081/#Comment_201081" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T08:19:50+00:00" title="April  7, 2009  8:19AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>You crazy kids with your<i>ideas</i>.
