I also created a simple standard campaign world that incorporates the way the new system works.<br/><br/>Over the course of time I have beta tested this system with my gaming groups and have reached the point where I have worked out all the kinks and am in the process of putting the finishing touches on the game manual. The manual is finished and will shortly be released to the internet on MaxOutRPG.com with a forum to discuss the system. The manual is, of course, free. I have to make some demo character sheets too.<br/><br/><br/>What I am looking for here are people who know how to play D&amp;D second edition and are willing to read the manual asap and beta test the game. Knowledge of D&amp;D isn't required though, as the system is fairly straightforward and explained in depth in the manual. RPG experience of course is an absolute must. Though the system itself is very technical, of course it is not the system itself that makes the game. I made this system to be able to handle anything I wanted to throw at the game storywise. It lets me incorporate anything I want, and you'll see how after you read the manual. I came to this forum, because well, what would be the point of making a new game if I didn't plug it at the story games forums. I want some of the best to take a look at what I've made and participate if they're interested. I've reproduced this intro message on a couple other forums, and I'll be launching the manual online within the next few days.<br/><br/>The manual explains exactly how the system works and is all anyone needs to be able to start playing the game. An understanding of second edition ad&amp;d helps, but otherwise the manual covers all the basics. <br/><br/>We could use this thread to handle things in the beginning, but ideally after people who have table top rpg gaming groups that get interested and play the game will be amongst the people who will help me build up a collection of new skills and directions the game can take on the forum for the game. You will understand what I mean after you learn the system.<br/><br/><br/>---- OK! That covers the basics. I haven't ranted about how absolutely cool this system is, and I haven't explained how this takes regular ad&amp;d and turns it into a universal role playing system that is more fun and interactive than any other system ever created. <br/><br/>I am finishing up the manual right now, but if anyone happens to sign up or is merely curious I am more than willing to shoot them over a copy of the manual in an unfinished state just so people can get the jump on how the system works.<br/><br/>Solely for the purpose of explaining the game, I am going to copy and paste the foreword to the manual.<br/><br/>Thankyou for listening! And I hope some of you are interested in playing my game and helping it grow!<br/><br/>*******<br/><br/>Max Out RPG<br/><br/>Max Out is a universal role playing system with extremely aggressive character growth and totally unique skill trees with endless possibilities. It is a hack for AD&amp;D 2nd edition and is any munchkins wet dream and nightmare combined. It will make combat faster and more powerful than ever. With Max Out no two characters will ever be alike again. Chances are they won't even be remotely similar after a few sessions. With Max Out cookie cutter is a thing of the past. Play one game of Max Out and you will never go back to regular AD&amp;D again.<br/><br/>Foreword:<br/><br/>I used to run a Final Fantasy campaign with AD&amp;D 2nd edition that took place in a campaign world which incorporated all of the squaresoft games. Since each game had its own system of combat and utilized different things (like materia, guardian spirits, summoning, ability points, items that used ability points) I had to come up with different ways that each system could be incorporated into AD&amp;D. The campaign flourished and lasted for a long time, but there were a few blaring problems that existed. Due to tons of different abilities and factors, calculating damage would take a long time. <br/><br/>Calculators became the norm and combat slowed down tediously. For any game this can spell doom for an attempt at keeping a fast pace, and can whittle away suspension built by good story. Another problem was that it was difficult to determine just what new abilities would be gained after each level up. This would be very taxing for any game master trying to come up with different progressions on the fly. I became dedicated to solving these problems and creating a streamlined rpg hack that would incorporate every different unique character progression as well as make combat much quicker. Meanwhile, Rogue Galaxy for Playstation 2 was due to be released and I was desperate to create a new system and campaign. Thus Max Out was born.<br/><br/>Requirements: <br/><br/>The only things needed to play Max Out is 6 sided, 10 sided, and 20 sided dice, and basic understanding of the way AD&amp;D works in second addition. A second edition players handbook would be ideal, but the only thing it is ever used for is bonuses gained from attributes and spell lists, so a 3rd edition players handbook can be substituted or supplemented to provide an alphabetical list of spells or those quick charts.<br/><br/>Anyone who has never played AD&amp;D before could easily start playing Max Out. While the spells and the modifiers for attributes in the players handbooks are used in my gaming group, it is possible to use many different styles of magic in the system, and attribute modifiers could easily be made up or copied from a web site. Once you know how to play Max Out you could easily play without any books. All you need is a knowledge of the system.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma" title="LordZoma"><img alt="LordZoma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma">LordZoma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231740/#Comment_231740" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T11:59:14+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 11:59AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The forums for the max out system has been launched.

Please don't take them the wrong way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes Max Out so awesome?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I mean is that, reading the above, I am seeing a lot of "like DnD 2nd edition, but better". Can you explain some of the improvements here?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes combat quicker in your game?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you mean when you say that your game "incorporates every different unique character progression"?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does your game solve that later editions of DnD (or even other systems) don't?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it a "munchkin's wet dream and nightmare combined"? What does that even mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems you have a lot of enthusiasm about this game (that's good!), but I fear the wall of text you submitted above is clouding the message you are trying to get across.

Its a little cluttered and perhaps entirely too open given the way you intend folks to create Advanced Tech. Also, naming conventions could use a revision.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should abandon a lot of the vestigial parts of AD&amp;D; Attribute measurements, multiple attacks, THAC0, HD and Character Level.<br/>\nIt seems to me that you can handle all of this with your 'everything has a Level' system instead.<br/>\nYou can roll a lot of the new stats into the Attributes this way.<br/>\nWeapon Skills can handle attack bonuses as well as power bonuses.<br/>\nMultiple attacks tend to break lots of combat systems. I would recommend implementing an interesting initiative system instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Fusion seems a little... ... ... book keeping intensive. Wouldn't it make more sense for the fused items to disappear? I've never played any game where that occurs. The Advanced designation is also a problem. The result of the fused item's level could just be the level of the combined items divided by 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all I have from a quick skim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma" title="LordZoma"><img alt="LordZoma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma">LordZoma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231905/#Comment_231905" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T18:23:48+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  6:23PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MacLeoud:<br><br>When individual items are fused they do disappear and create the single fusion. If you fuse a sword into a spear, both go away and create the new item.<br><br>The vestigal parts of AD&amp;D are what this system is based on. Multiple attacks, thaco, hd, character level, attributes. This system is designed as a hack for ad&amp;d not as a completely brand new system.<br><br>It would certainly be possible to abandon the ad&amp;d style and go in another direction, but that's not something I want to do or plan on doing in the near future.<br><br>Combat goes quicker in maxout for a few reasons. Since players never have to worry about calculating damage other than a quick multiplier or two there is less concentration on mathematics and the game flows faster. I couldn't write a speech about it, but I can tell you that it does from game experience.<br><br>It 'incorporates unique progressions' in the sense that it allows players to grow their character in their own way rather than being confined to a limited skill tree as listed in a book somewhere. Fusion allows any two components of a character to be melded together to create something new. Infinite possibilities = Unique growth opportunities.<br><br>What does munchkins wet dream and nightmare combined even mean? It's an advertisement. What do you expect it to mean? A munchkin may be dazzled by how powerful they can see their character becoming utilizing the system, but may be mortified when they realize that the progression of growth is done in a fair and balanced manner that takes far longer for any character to even begin to approach broken than munchkins are used to.<br><br>I'll have to be specific at some point charlie, but at this point, I'm working on launching the game and not detailing the nitty gritty. Maybe one of my players will hop on and discuss the game system.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231910/#Comment_231910" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T18:32:43+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  6:32PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, can't say I didn't try to help. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma" title="LordZoma"><img alt="LordZoma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma">LordZoma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232034/#Comment_232034" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-12T13:47:42+00:00" title="September 12, 2009  1:47PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The website <br><br>MaxOutRPG.com <br><br>is now online (although in a skimpy beta mode) and the game manual is available there to download along with a link to the forums that will be the center for resources for game expansion.<br><br>The primary difference between MaxOut and regular AD&amp;D, is in the way how in AD&amp;D a character's growth is limited by his experience which is gained through combat.

This is similarly the case if the character has combat but does not receive enough experience to level up. No change.<br><br>Character growth in AD&amp;D, aside from just being limited by experience points, is done in an extremely small manner. Every few levels get a skill point. Wow. Congratulations.
