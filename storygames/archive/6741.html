Along with jargon like "rules lawyer" and "munchkin" I feel like it slaps a overly-simplistic and pejorative label on a complex set of behaviors.  I've been around conversations that went along the lines of "and when this happened, that player fucking turtled" and they bother me.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone shows up to a game, especially a convention game, planning on holding back and refusing to engage with the rules, the game content, or the other players at the table.  I think people show up wanting to engage with the game and their fellow players.  When people "turtle" then, it's because there are obstacles or issues that are preventing them from being able to comfortably engage with what's going on.  But I often get the sense that "turtling" is supposedly the fault of the unengaged player.  Like, here is everybody else, bringing all the awesome, and what the fuck is wrong with the guy who looks uncomfortable and isn't in here getting muddy up to his elbows with the rest of us?<br/><br/>Especially when a lot of indie games expect a level of player pro-activity and involvement in decision making that may seem rather alien to folks from other gaming backgrounds, I think the expectation that everyone will be able to jump in and start playing "our way" is blatantly unfair.  Is it not worth our time to help people who don't instantly connect with a game to find a way in?  Even at convention games, I feel like players have a responsibility to make sure everyone else at the table is having a good time and feels involved.  And sometimes that means going above and beyond the call of duty, making the game measurably less fun for everyone else, in order to get a reluctant or overwhelmed player to engage.  I just feel like that should be part of the social contract when a group of people sit down at a table to play together.<br/><br/>For example, at Story Games Boston, we play a large number of games that require heavy player involvement.  One of the biggest obstacles for newcomers and even some regulars is rotating scene framing.  Many people, even after playing indie games for a while, would much rather have someone else frame a scene than have to do it themselves, either because they have trouble coming up with ideas on the fly, they are not confident in their own ability to frame scenes, or the just feel like other people would do a better job.  Should we play games that have one or two people framing all the scenes, to make them more comfortable?  That could be one approach, but generally we just have the other players step in and help out.  Honestly, I'm not sure if that allows the uncomfortable players to get more confident in their scene framing, but it's part of a process that will hopefully lead there.  But I don't blame them for "turtling" when the baton gets passed their way.  I try to find ways for them to stay engaged.<br/><br/>Another example: I was playtesting <i>Escape or Die</i> with the Evil Hat crowd at GenCon last year.  It was 11pm, I was really tired, and the theme we'd decided on was Tron-style old-school computer stuff.  For the life of me, try as hard as I could, I could not get that vibe to flow through me for some reason; the witty ideas just wouldn't come, despite Rob sitting across from me doing his hilarious "I'm Peter Packet; I make the internet go!" routine.  And <i>Escape or Die</i> is all about doing things quickly, since the game itself is on a timer.  But everyone else would stare at me while I sat there for 3 minutes trying to come up with a creative idea... and ultimately I'd just say something really, really lame.  Bless them, they went with it anyway, but it was like pulling teeth.  I felt really shitty afterwards, like I'd let everyone else down.<br/><br/>Basically, my point is that there are all sorts of legitimate reasons players might not be able to engage:<br/><br/>- Lack of confidence / Feeling intimidated<br/>- Lack of familiarity<br/>- Confusion / Don't understand rules<br/>- Tired / Out of it<br/>- Not excited about / uncomfortable with the direction of the game<br/><br/>And none of these are their fault or, necessarily, things that they can do something about on their own.  So I feel like labeling all of them indistinguishably as "turtling" both masks what's really going on and implies that there's nothing the other players can do about it, that it's somehow due to a choice on the part of the unengaged player, the player who's most likely sitting there feeling like complete shit for not being able to connect.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149582/#Comment_149582" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T07:47:08+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  7:47AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan:<br/><br/>I see turtling as something distinct from not being in the zone, or from having problems with a particular game. I think turtling is a consistent pattern of behavior that carries from game to game. A person who turtles is going to be very resistant to group attempts to help them get into the game, and changing games is going to have little to no effect.<br/><br/>I speak from personal experience. My husband invited a close personal friend of his into our gaming group - we'll call him M. M flatly refused to engage with emotional content in any of the games we played. When we played With Great Power... he turtled like a demon and tried to frame Suffering in terms of bad but emotionally neutral things happening to his character. We switched to Universalis, hoping that might be a more comfortable fit. Again the same pattern of behavior - he would only frame emotionally neutral scenes.<br/><br/>The thing is, whenever we were playing a game where the default mode was silliness, he was totally on and engaged. We played a silly game of Donjon and he was a total hoot. It wasn't discomfort with the rules, it wasn't fatigue - not when it happened every session - and it definitely wasn't lack of familiarity with the group. Hell, everyone in the group had known each other for *years*.<br/><br/>So I'll agree with you that not everyone can bring the awesome 100% of the time, and that we shouldn't demonize people when they have an off day. But I also want to put it out there that turtling isn't an imaginary phenomenon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149583/#Comment_149583" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T07:47:33+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  7:47AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 7:51AM by David Artman.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I have a totally different meaning for turtling.

Turtling provides a means to wait out while more proactive competitors weaken each other; at the right time, the turtle becomes a tiger, pouncing on the hindmost to snag victory points or whatever's at stake.<br/><br/>As you seem to object as much to the concatenation of causes into one vague term, as you do to the presumption of individual blame rather than group blame, I figured I'd mention that (original?) definition, as it is more concrete and specific.

BUT I've also seen what Jonathan describes and sometimes it is also referred to turtling. I'm not sure what to call it. I tend to call it Narrative Gamist or Competitive Narratavists. <br/><br/>It's the situation where Narrative games are played as a competition. Instead of who can out think or out strategize each other in a Gamist sense, it's about who can out cool or out premise each other. It's still a competition between players. I've seen it happen quite a bit with many different gaming groups (not just indie gamers) and con games. Throw in the trend of turning games to 11 and it can get a bit overwhelming. <br/><br/>It's very intimidating to have people taking turns out cooling each other and then looking to you expectantly and you decide to go the more mellow route and have your character subtly do something and everyone look disappointed, uninteresting, or worse... openly question your creative input. Nothing kills my enthusiasm quicker than telling me my contribution sucks. And I've had it happen quite a bit and I consider myself a good player, fairly extraverted, creative and I tend to enjoy in your face games where social skills are prized higher than tactical skills.<br/><br/>It's bizarre!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149591/#Comment_149591" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T08:06:44+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  8:06AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anna, was it more than that player being uninterested in emotionally-focused play, and trying to get around it by fudging with what Suffering was supposed to mean?   I mean, you were there and I wasn't, so I don't want to categorize what happened in a way that trumps your own experiences, but that sounds a bit like the "not excited about / comfortable with" problem, since it was a particular kind of play that triggered a disengagement.<br/><br/>I'm not at all trying to say that "turtling" is imaginary.  I'm just trying to, like David suggested, break down a term I find counter-productive into a series of related problems and address those more specifically, and do so in a way that doesn't put all the blame on players who are having trouble engaging with everyone else at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149592/#Comment_149592" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T08:08:22+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  8:08AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My definition of turtling is the same as Anna's. You see it a lot if you run a lot of games at conventions. These are players who seek to defend their characters by not engaging in any conflicts. They almost never assume the spotlight themselves. When asked what their character is doing, they invariably seek to hide or place their character as far from a current conflict as possible. <br/><br/>In my experience, most of these players tend to see the goal of a convention scenario as surviving the session unchanged. This idea is incredibly common.<br/><br/>Generally, when I encounter one of these players during a game, I'll take him or her aside and say, "Look, this is it. You're never going to play this character again. You've got four hours. Take some risks and have some fun with it."<br/><br/>I have about 50% success with that. The others just refuse to engage.<br/><br/>The people who fall under Jonathan's five reasons are very different than those who are turtling, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149593/#Comment_149593" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T08:12:31+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  8:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was the receiver of a very good bit of player engagement at GenCon last year in Tony LBs quick game of PTA.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe and my friend were at the end of the table and everyone was firing around ideas for 'Gem and the Holograms done by JJ Abrams' in a very loud and enthusiastic style.

Is there something we can do about that?' or some such. It was very nice.

In both cases, gameplay stopped in order to wait for a player\u2019s decision.  But in looking at the excerpts, it seems clear that the motivation leading to the behavior was different.  In one case, it was an inability to decide on a character\u2019s action.  In the other, it seemed to be a deliberate choice not to choose--the defensive strategy Thor and others mention, above.  Turtling would need to be a very broad term to cover the range of motivations or causes that lead to otherwise similar behavior.  This, of course, supports Jonathan's point the 'turtling' label may sometime be inaccurately applied.  I know I did.  I tend now to think of turtling as a player-selected strategy that requires no intervention.  Likewise, I try to watch for dis-engaged players for whatever reason in order to help them get involved in the game.       <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149615/#Comment_149615" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T09:12:58+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  9:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 9:20AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            wundergeek:  by any chance, does M's job (or personal life) have a heavy emotional component to it?<br/><br/>I ask because a couple of players in my group have insanely stressful jobs, and as a result what they want out of a game is something that doesn't push the same buttons that are already getting jammed down constantly during the rest of their week.

Players taking a defensive posture towards both emotional and tactical parts of play, trying to "win," or "survive" or avoid possible humiliation or victimization even when that doesn't seem especially likely or the intent of the other players (Anna and Thor and others).<br/><br/>3.

After that bit of mental gymnastics I actually had a pretty good time.<br/><br/>(2) I ran a few games when I was starting to incorporate some indie philosophy into how I did things. Mike played a selection of indistinguishable Pro From Dover types who were unflappable, irresistible to the opposite sex, and never made mistakes. We were all just getting into the flow of player-authored contributions, so I didn't really notice that his were almost all descriptions of locations. The only yellow flag that went off in my head was when he got excited about the idea of introducing a nightclub as a recurring set, so he traded in his character for one almost exactly identical who owned a nightclub. "Couldn't Shea just have inherited it, or something?" I thought, but didn't dwell on it.<br/><br/>(3) We played an Amber campaign using homebrew FATE-style rules. Mike's character concept was an elder Amberite who was a pacifist and ran a coffeehouse in Amber City. I get excited - cool, there's lots of ways that could go.<br/><br/>In play, here's how it went. When conflicts came up, we discovered that Mike equated pacifism with "unwillingness to act under any circumstance". When some characters went to the coffee house and I handed it over to Mike to describe the place... We. Were. Listening. For. A. Half. Hour. I literally could not stop him describing every filigree and character in excruciating detail. (Lest you think we were just shifting awkwardly while he did this, no, we said several times "Hey, that's a great description, let's save the rest for if it comes up in play". He <i>was</i> playing, it was his time to shine.)<br/><br/>After a few sessions, Mike seemed to notice that a character who will take no action, become embroiled in no alliances, and in fact is not willing to leave his coffee house very often is not a very fun character to play in an Amber-inspired setting. He then switched to the character's son, a ... Pro From Dover who was inflappable, sexy, and never made a mistake. Who took one decisive action at the campaign climax, killing a character one of the other PCs had been pursuing for vengeance the entire campaign.<br/><br/>"Hey, I helped! That was awesome!" Mike said, over the noise of the grinding of teeth from the My Life Is Vengeance PC's player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149655/#Comment_149655" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T10:49:43+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 10:49AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 10:57AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (4) One of our player's girlfriends (we'll call her T) expressed interest in running a game for our group, so we gave it a shot. Not a good fit at all, as it turned out. This woman was Unfrozen Caveman Fantasy Heartbreak Writer, and we were now her captive audience to experience the joy of her lovingly crafted homebrew fantasy world. <br/><br/>This game was Clash of the Creative Agendas in IMAX and in retrospect I wouldn't have missed it for the world. The (unstated but obviously clear) assumptions from T are: group will work well as a party, they will explore the fictional environment in great detail and discover clues, and above all, No Munchinism! <br/><br/>The actual party: Veronica Mars if she'd lived in the middle ages, a lecherous old commune leader "holy man" modeled after the head of the compound in <i>Big Love</i>, Micky the Pikey from <i>Snatch</i> (except not a particularly good fighter, or really good at anything), a steampunk pistelero paladin type, and ... A sexy female thief, The Pro From Dover. <br/><br/>Once we figured out that T didn't really care what the fuck our characters did as long as we didn't Munchkin (that is, succeed at the challenges she's presented without really suffering for it), we were fine. Only two characters had any reason to care about the plot anyway, and the plucky teen/lecherous cultist/befuddled gypsy dynamic went like wildfire without any GM input. As long as we made the odd reference to The Plot and made sure our shenanigans looked relevant to it, we could merrily play on. <br/><br/>So of the two players engaging with the GM's plot, the steampunk pistelero was T's boyfriend, and he dutifully chased clues. Mike's hot ninja chick did the same, but in a way that actively prevented the other characters from knowing what he was doing or even that he was doing it. Apart from a few minutes every half hour he was pretty much invisible.(He was offered a chance to double-cross the group and basically fulfill the end conditions of the plot in a way that benefited his True Masters, and man his eyes just lit up. From that point on, no other character got a straight answer from Mike's character, ever.)<br/><br/>We manage to find some satisfying emotional climax as the plot events climax around us, but overall it was a case where most of the party either fought the GM for the creative agenda or just went off and played on their own. We groused, Mike chimed in with complaints as well... but I could see his heart wasn't in it. He'd played the hell out of Ninja Chick in his head and he was still feeling the high. He had the least involvement of anyone with the game, but By God he "won".<br/><br/>Wow, that's a lot longer than I expected. But there you go, the case study of our group's "turtle". What I think it boils down to is that no matter how much we have a talk about "Table rules" and that this particular campaign is going to be driven by the PCs making tough decisions and living with the consequences of it... Mike doesn't want to do tough decisions and living with consequences. Gaming is his escape time, and if that means he kicks back with a beer and virtual plays his Lara Croft character for a few hours while we occasionally beg him to get involved, he's happy.<br/><br/>There's no "fix" to this, of course -- in fact, the kinda creepy part is that once this really clicked in my head as to his gaming motivations, I started realizing I could view his non-gaming motivations that way as well. This made me feel like a bad person, because "I value life experiences based on how cool they make me look, and not based on how they facilitate my personal growth" is a VERY cynical way to regard a friend,  and I don't want to be that cynical <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/>I hope someone can figure out how this is relevant, because I seem to have lost the plot. Oh right, turtling. In this example, presented as <br/><br/>- Unwillingness to commit to choices that might have consequences<br/>- Unwillingess to have the character show weakness or additional complexity<br/>- Above all, an unwillingness to have the character <i>change</i>, even if that change is completely driven by him.<br/><br/>I think the frequent creation and introduction of new characters tied into this, as well. My armchair gamer psychoanalysis would be that he's continually reinventing the same character, looking for a certain experience. But to have that character change in play would go against character inviolatability, so he can't really get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149669/#Comment_149669" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T11:14:22+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 11:14AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 11:16AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh. Okay, now another "turtle", for comparison... me, in the D&amp;D and homebrew games. I will name this variant the Tragedy Turtle. I think this is the one that PaulB mentioned above, unwilling to engage with the mechanics.<br/><br/>In both games, I started off with good-faith efforts to engage the game as presented by the GM. When I saw that those were going to turn into "ha ha you did it wrong", I decided (right or wrong) that I was no longer going to particularly care about my character's effectiveness and ability to advance the plot.<br/><br/>I found new motivations for playing, essentially thinking, "If I'm going to get screwed anyway, hell, I'll make my character <i>about</i> getting screwed. I'll fuck up on purpose." I absolutely went down the well of tragedy and splashed around. I made a point of not being disruptive -- I didn't foul up anyone else's plans they were excited about -- but I predicated everything I wanted to do on the assumption that if I failed at it, great, and if not, I'd describe success in such a way that I'd failed by winning. From there I could just enjoy having a character who was having lots of bad things happen, and they were mostly his own fault.<br/><br/>One example from the homebrew. We were gathering some information. I described how I was going to hole up in my room and dose up on a peyote-style substance to enter a meditative trance and attempt to divine some information. Sure, I have to roll.. but I'm rolling to see whether or not I actually get the information. I don't care about <i>that</i>, I want the Clueless Gypsy to burst in demanding something while I'm absolutely out of it, and that can happen whether I win or lose the stakes.<br/><br/>The funny thing is, as you can well guess, once I started ruthlessly screwing my character, all the GM fudging that had started to "keep me honest" suddenly swung around the other direction to "keep me alive". I almost had to fight over killing my cultist lecher off at the end of the game; I think I was able to cast it as a "heroic sacrifice" rather than "this old git finally got what is coming to him" before the GM relented and let me die. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So my question is, was I turtling in the opposite direction? (Hence "Tragedy Turtle") I know it's a totally different thing -- getting *only* emotionally invested in the character, allowing them to suffer and change, and not investing in the other stuff that's going on -- but it was definately still a case of not playing the game that was on the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149704/#Comment_149704" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T12:28:12+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 12:28PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>1.

We'd gone to some trouble to fit our characters together before the game started, so I had plenty of good intra-PC roleplay that I could do, and I figured that I'd just go ahead and concentrate on that instead.  When the plot required me to make a roll I would dutifully pick up my dice and do so, but that wasn't where the game was for me anymore -- the game was now centered on the hilarious, fun, complicated in-character conversations and relationships we were depicting, and I got a lot of people to play that game with me.  I sort of feel bad about this when I remember the irritated and slightly sad face the GM would make when our in-character kibbitzing got in the way of his story.  (It was a decent story, just not one that let us do anything.  He's gotten better since then.)<br/><br/>The second was in Primetime Adventures, a game that I freely admit I don't understand how to enjoy playing.  The game just didn't click with our group for a lot of reasons, and while I wasn't the first person to realize that, I <i>was</i> the first to start removing my character from any conflicts.  My character only got involved in scenes that had nothing to do with him or with his issue, and I just stuck to providing supporting-character dialogue, comic relief, and out-of-character suggestions to other people because I couldn't have fun playing the actual game.<br/><br/>It does sort of sound like turtling, but like Graham said earlier, it's really more symptomatic of a group problem than anything else.  The game wasn't working and wasn't going to be fixed, and rather than quit, we just carved out a smaller niche within the game and made our own game inside it.  This was bad because it disrupted the main game to some degree (large or small), but good because it produced fun play for some (i.e., anyone who was playing the smaller game) where no fun would have been had otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149715/#Comment_149715" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T12:48:35+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 12:48PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jon,<br/>\n  I have been accused of Narrative Turtling (as opposed to the Tactical version) on a couple of occasions (as well as clenching) and typically its because of one of two things:<br/>\n1) Everyone is throwing ideas out so fast, there is not a space for me to talk without talking over someone else<br/>\n2) My ideas have been shot down before and I don't know how to throw out ideas that people will dig...<br/>\n  Now, I will admit, that in a semi-social situation, it is my instinct to listen than to speak.

Also I quite definately DO NOT mean the other definitions.  ie. someone unable or willing to engage in the game itself, to me, is not turtling.  I had a player who would bring the game to a grinding halt when we got to him for scene framing.  His synapses just weren't firing in the same way all these improv/GM types were.  That's not turtling for me.<br/><br/>As Thor noted turtling has to do with not engaging in the conflict, specifically.  Not out of discomfort with a group or a game, but because they don't want to risk.  Sure, I suppose it has a tactical element but I think it has more to do with internalizing the character's struggles and saying "obviously the best thing to do here is nothing.  That would be safest."<br/><br/>Of course, that is anathema to most stories.  When I see someone turtling I remind them that complications and conflict are the meat and potatoes of good story, that the game is far more interesting if bad things happen to characters.<br/><br/>We had a long running larp that over time the players would paint themselves into defensive corners and then complain that the GMs were using fiat in order to cause them problems.  Of course, if the players were open to having conflicts they may actually lose then the GMs wouldn't have had to do the hand waving and they may have generated their own difficulties.  Otherwise we all sit around and look at one another.<br/><br/>I feel there is a subtle difference with Johnathan's list and what Thor and I are describing.

I think you and Thor are describing <i>actual turtling</i>, sort of "Classic Turtling" if you like, while Jonathan's list is specifically "things frequently misidentified as turtling even though it's overly simplistic to do so."<br/><br/>There's some crossover between the two, of course...I think at least in some cases players may engage in Classic Turtling for reasons relating to the issues Jonathan identifies, and addressing <i>those</i> problems may be more productive than just pointing and yelling "YOU GODDAMN TURTLE, START TAKING MORE RISKS!" (or whatever punitive measures are currently in vogue).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149729/#Comment_149729" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T13:08:11+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  1:08PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/>\n  Narrative players have been calling a lack of narrative participation "Turtling" for over a year (Over two or three years if my understanding is correct), its too late to protest now...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149731/#Comment_149731" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T13:11:35+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  1:11PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 1:11PM by J_Walton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...you can't just reinvent words.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change" rel="nofollow">*Cackles madly in the face of the inevitable.*</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149739/#Comment_149739" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T13:19:15+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  1:19PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 1:19PM by Quintin Stone.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>I got mad-respect for Judd and all here, but you can't just reinvent words.</blockquote>\nIs it time for another Jargon Week?

I have a question for you.<br/><br/>Say I'm running a game at a convention and you're playing in it. I've prepped a bunch of characters with problems and I have situation to kick off play with - including a list of two or three bangs for each character. You take a character based on whatever your preferences are. We start play, and I toss everyone a bang, and you're the only one who says "my guy goes to a bar and bemoans his fate."<br/><br/>Now, -my- instinct there is to go "he's not really engaged yet. Better turn up the heat!" It sounds from your post like thats the exact opposite of what would actually be fun for you, right? It's not that you want more intense choices to make, it's that you want to participate in a lower-key way, right? <br/><br/>So, my question for you is, how do I as the GM engage you in this game? Is it by taking you aside and asking you how you would be more comfortable? Is it by having an expressly "support character" pregen who is aimed at not being in the narrative spotlight?<br/><br/>(To be clear, "me" is the hardcore story-driving GM and "you" is a player who is obviously interested in the game in question, but has a play background or personal preference for play that leads to avoiding the spotlight.

And that that is what the character is about. So, I think he is saying, if you put him in a no win situation, the choice is meaningless (aka Save the kid vs stop the bad guy). Where as if you engage the character with a choice like Stop the Bad guy with mercy or murder, that is potentially more meaningful, no?<br/>\n  Admittedly, I am just guessing, because that is not my preference.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150036/#Comment_150036" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T09:16:44+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:16AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there's this guy Bob in my group who seems to freeze up. Call it whatever you want. Here's an example.<br/><br/>We're playing My Life with Master. I'm the GM. Bob is one of the players. I'm playing in a very scene-oriented way, with one scene per minion (PC). Bob watches the other three players do their scenes. It's Bob's turn. I, playing the Master, give his character some dastardly order to complete. I am met with silence. I help a bit, suggesting possibilities, asking questions, but get no response. Silence. Eventually another player suggests some things and he does those things. His next few scenes are about the same. I sense the other players are getting less willing to help him. <br/><br/>His next scene comes around. Master gives his character an order. Now, the structure of the game at this point is pretty fixed. In resolution terms, I have initiated a conflict and the player can role-play the reaction to show us how the character feels about the order, role-play to earn intimacy bonus dice, or roll the dice to resist the Master. I can't think of anything else the player can do at that point. I get silence. This time the other players don't help. I am curious how long he'll sit there (and passive-aggressively taking out my annoyance on him, probably), so I don't help. The five of us sit there in silence for about 60 seconds. <br/><br/>It was one of the most awkward 60 seconds of my almost 30 years of gaming experience. <br/><br/>I suppose I need to just talk to him outside the game and find out what's wrong. I'm new to the group and I don't know him well. He's probably uncomfortable with the intense play MLwM can elicit. I was probably a dick but, at the time, I figured that the other guys were doing fine, so he should buck up. Pretty insensitive.<br/><br/>But he does this in other games, too, I've noticed. So there has to be a conversation at some point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150041/#Comment_150041" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T09:27:00+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/>\n  My 2 cents (no change please): maybe he was just thinking it through. a lot of gamers like to think about what they want to do. MAybe he was using the other players kibitzing as time to work out his options. Or maybe he didn't totally get the game. Or maybe he was out of his comfort zone.<br/>\n  But, my guess is his pacing threshold might just be slower than yours...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RaconteurX" title="RaconteurX"><img alt="RaconteurX" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RaconteurX">RaconteurX</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151781/#Comment_151781" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T00:56:29+00:00" title="June 20, 2008 12:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Disengagement in my experience is due to one of several things. Either the player isn't adept at impromptu creativity, tends to over-analyze when faced with difficult choices, freezes when engaged in a manner which falls outside his or her comfort zone, or is actively refusing to engage in the premise. I'll illustrate using the folks with whom I used to play Star Trek.<br/>\n<br/>\nT. played the ship's captain, but rarely made a quick decision in a crisis. As a player, she wasn't especially good at visualizing tactical situations and tended to get stuck in the details. We made up for that by letting other players to recommend choices to her OOC as "the voice of tactics" inside her character's head.<br/>\n<br/>\nL. played the ship's doctor, but was a casual gamer at heart and there to hang out and enjoy the unfolding story as audience more than participant. She tended to freeze up if forced to take an active role and had a bit of trouble when it came to extemporaneous interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nE. played the chief of security, but always tended to play the same type of character no matter what game he was playing. Outside the range of that character type, he usually dragged his feet when confronted with other situations. He didn't like to be nudged out of his happy place, but a little patience could bring him out.<br/>\n<br/>\nB. played the ship's first officer, but tended to focus entirely on problem-solving and "winning". Any tactical situation would generally include at least a few challenges over the details as presented, as B. sought any and every advantage so he could not only win but win decisively. He tended to complain constantly and be a disruptive influence if not assuaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite all the potential for disengagement, we had a very successful and enjoyable game. Knowing all the group's foibles, it was easy to find ways to keep everyone involved and head off problems which occurred. The key was understanding that the group as a whole must commit to engaging one another. Patience and communication were the means to deflect problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

So there has to be a conversation at some point.</blockquote>Hey, Adam. Sounds like the dude has stage fright (of course, I'm not there, so I really don't know shit). You know, the fear of everyone staring at him thinking he's doing something wrong....wait. Anyway, when someone else suggests a move it relieves the pressure by reducing the personal responsibility for what happens. There seems to be a built in solution though, just don't require him to take 100% of the social responsibility. A gentle suggestion to him of something that you think would be fun for the whole table, and he's off like a lark.<br/><br/>As for the term turtling. I like it. I think its useful and descriptive. It may have gotten its start as a description of defensive play in tactical wargames, but in my mind its been pretty well extended to story-games. I use it as a description of defensive, evasive player behaviors that are consciously or subconsciously employed to protect the player from perceived social consequences of engaging in the very conflicts that are central to the creation of the shared fiction. The things that I see are important is that the behavior is due to the player trying to protect themselves, not the character (or not only the character), and that the behavior impacts the table by frustrating attempts to move the fiction along through conflicts. Also, I'm not saying the player is trying to do this, or even that their fears of acting assertively are not justified. There's probably lots of justifications for this kind of behavior. I'm not blaming. I'm naming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152313/#Comment_152313" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T20:14:31+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  8:14PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2008 8:18PM by Logos7.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just in responce to what was asked of me above, <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not a low key player, but if i'm pressed with bangs I will turtle. When i turtle i'm not asking for lowerkey option or new options (ie a new bang) but rather different less bangy options<br/>\n<br/>\nIn responce to:<br/>\nSo, my question for you is, how do I as the GM engage you in this game? Is it by taking you aside and asking you how you would be more comfortable? Is it by having an expressly "support character" pregen who is aimed at not being in the narrative spotlight?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs i said above, I don't think my turtling is predestining me to support character pregen, which seems to me to more or less synomous with uninteresting character for people who don't really want to be there. If you were going to try to engage me I would think the best way is not to use bangs. (In some sense my turtling in these kinds of situations is my way of redefining win, it was mentioned a bit above about it being a meaningful vs a lose-lose situation, but that's perhaps too extreme for where i am. I think a badly executed bang leads to the loose loose situation. I'm still kind of alergic to genuine bangs. I don't think its a question of who wants narrative time, but the quality of narrative control. <br/>\n<br/>\nA bad bang would seem to be to be something like, kill the baby or let loose the demon paladin<br/>\na okay bang would seem to be something like, help this old lady get her cat out of the tree like the shining paradigm of chivalary you are or be on time for the religious ceremony of great importance to you and your paladinny ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe okay bang will end up with me either A: Attempting to ignore it (my paladin in his brash eagerness for the church does not see the old lady),  B: Choosing randomly C: sitting dumbfounded while i sit dumbfounded trying to figure out what i should do and what others want me to do and/or eventually doing neither. ( i.e. it kind of ruined my mojo leading to said bar waffling)<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think the turtling is not attempting to disengage from the game for me (the very conflicts that are central to the creation of the shared fiction a phrase which pardon me but sounds pretentious to me) but rather redefine the grounds of the narrative. If the person is turtling during combat, a specific phase, a specific method, etc it probably means they don't like said combat, phase, method, etc. Does it affect the fiction, probably but most games have more than one avenue of resolution/advancment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure this post went well I think i started waffling, and I'm not particularly impressed with noclues post. Anyway hope this helps and as always everything in this post is just me jabbering.<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: also the taking aside would annoy me as a player, I don't think turtling is an automatic sign of feebleness and or inability that requires magic dm kisses to make them better. At a con I would run full tilt and if someone is not engaging/enjoying themselves the timeslot of small enough/ investment low enough to make lost time effort just the name of the game.  If it was happening in a real life game alot i might ask out of session if everyone is enjoying the game./where it is going/how it is getting there but i don't think there is a bandaid solution ( or at least one that has a chance of avoiding those craffty defensive players who are avoiding the mechanics of making a story even if they don't know it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nhaha, okay i kept the main post preety neutral that's good right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tork" title="tork"><img alt="tork" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tork">tork</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152327/#Comment_152327" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T23:02:51+00:00" title="June 22, 2008 11:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2008 11:08PM by tork.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Logos, the way you're characterizing bangs seems a little funny to me - basically as situations where the player must choose a positive and a negative consequence.  Unless something has changed in the last few years of theory discussion, a bang is just a situation that requires the player to make a thematically significant decision.  It doesn't have to be binary, and it doesn't necessarily have to carry a direct negative consequence.  Is the 'choose a negative consequence' aspect to your examples what you don't like about bangs?  <br/><br/>Also, in the examples you offer, choices you make that directly engage the bang will say something about your character, and maybe even change who they are.  For instance, in your 'better bang' example, you say you'd probably choose to rush by and never even notice the little old lady with a cat in the tree.  This is basically the one option that says nothing about your character.  Do you specifically dislike bangs that change how your character is defined?<br/><br/>Here's a simple example of a bang which doesn't have clearly delineated binary options, but that still requires a decision on your part, I'm curious as to how you would respond to it and whether it would bother you:  You're playing a cop in a police procedural game.  You discover that your partner has a drug habit.  How would you respond to that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152331/#Comment_152331" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T00:00:36+00:00" title="June 23, 2008 12:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2008 12:07AM by noclue.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>the very conflicts that are central to the creation of the shared fiction a phrase which pardon me but sounds pretentious to me</blockquote>Yeah, it was pretty pretentious. I was using my pretentious internet voice. Anyway, if it helps I just mean that when I say someone is turtling (and I stress this is my usage, it may not square with others), I mean they are avoiding putting their character into conflicts, in order to avoid putting themselves in situations they find uncomfortable. (Edit: For this reason, I don't consider someone just being a quiet player, or enjoying being out of the spotlight, to be turtling). At least, that's what I see in myself when I catch myself turtling. Its not that I'm purposefully blocking, I'm uncomfortable and the blocking is a defense mechanism. Once I realize that in my own play, I've been able to change how I am approaching the game and jump headlong into the narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152374/#Comment_152374" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T06:44:58+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  6:44AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks for that response, Logos.

Do you see all those behaviors as turtling, or just some of them. Am I right that you are using  Turtling to mean something like "disruptive play resulting from not being emotionally engaged in the game?"  If so, its a bit different from my working definition, which is more about blocking behaviors as opposed to disengaging from the game emotionally.

I feel like blocking is just that -- blocking someone's efforts by not leaving them an alterate path. The stuff you "add" to the SIS results in a dead-end. I think that <i>can</i> happen passively, or perhaps inadvertently. And that's probably exactly what's going on more often than not among my own local blockers.<br/><br/>AP example: in our current Reign game, most sessions start with all the players talking through what the Company might want to accomplish that night. Inevitably, after it looks like there's almost a consensus, one of the players will say, "No, I don't think we should do that." That's a block, right? But get this: after a couple of moments he'll get some support for his "No," by virtue of someone saying, "Okay, fine, we'll do something else." But they're not asking the blocker! They're going back to the table. I almost feel like that "okay, you win" position is itself a form of blocking -- both by allowing the first "no" to take place, and because there's no request for the blocker to elucidate. Probably passive-aggressive behavior, but it's all pretty genial. <br/><br/>Ken: When I see turtling behavior leading to blocking, it looks like this: If Player X is remaining unengaged, but I need Player X to do something (something gam-ish like "defend the corridor with your best area effect spell" or nar-ish like "it'd be fun if you defended your sister against my sexual advances"), not only is he turtling but his turtling is blocking my own efforts.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152990/#Comment_152990" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T14:26:36+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  2:26PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm thinking of turtling as "I don't want to contribute" either 'cause<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

That's interesting, because I would use turtling to describe the person who blocks out of self protection or instinct, while the person who is stepping on other people's fun on purpose would get a more nasty monicker. Hmmm....<br/><br/>Let me try this again.<br/><br/>When I'm playing defensively and/or declining to engage with the game, which I think of when I refer to "turtling", I'm focused only on my self-preservation (as a player, as a character, whatever -- it's about <i>not getting hurt</i>). All that matters is that I'm holding the game and its consequences at arm's length. Ken's (Z-Dog's) list is really good.<br/><br/>Blocking is <i>me</i> keeping <i>you</i> from doing something. That may have its roots in defensive/unengaged play -- what you want to do is a threat to me (the player or my character) and I have nothing further to add to that. Or it may have its roots in control: It's not my idea, so ... <i>no</i>. Or it's because what's happening is at odds with my visualization of events, even if it's cooler/better (actually, this sounds a lot like the previous idea). The end result is, it's a creative cul-de-sac. <br/><br/>I don't have a lot of AP experience with turtling or blocking, but I know I've done both and they've felt different (as I use those words). <br/><br/>AP turtling: My last D&amp;D (3.5) game, I'm playing a magic user and I've accumulated some high-level spells the DM doesn't know what to do with, since they're giving me the power to derail his game. So it becomes a power struggle: I've arranged my character's development to solve his plot, and his plot can't handle it. But he's a viking-hat DM, so he fiats away spell effects, whatever. My reaction is to lock down. Don't engage with the game. Don't give the GM any ammo or ideas as to what our plans are. Classic dysfunctional behavior. <br/><br/>AP blocking: This one's tough, because I'm probably more guilty of blocking as a GM than I am as a player, and the motives are way different. Oh, here's an unfortunate one from a PTA game I was in: Some scene comes up where another player is describing his thing: does the setup, sets up the NPCs, lays it out pretty good. And, like, 10 minutes into his exposition I'm all "Nah...I don't buy it. That's not how we've been describing (NPC)." And that's it. I'm not turtling because I have nothing at stake. But I've just delivered a fairly crushing social blow to a fellow player, with no real malice intended, but the air goes out of the scene and we're left with blah. Not a proud moment for me.<br/><br/>Does that make it any clearer? Does it still seem similar from the outside? Because I can certainly see a case where there may be a difference without a distinction.<br/><br/>p.<br/><br/>EDIT: I can see where, arguably, I <i>do</i> have something at stake -- my personal vision of the game space. So maybe it really isn't an important distinction after all...<br/><br/>ANOTHER EDIT: So perhaps I should be thinking of blocking as a turtling technique.

It may be blocking. I'm not sure. You're blocking the other players narrative input, but that's a bit different from blocking within a scene by having your character refuse valid offers.<br/><br/>To me, turtling is about crawling behind a shell to protect oneself from <b>the game</b>, not about properly protecting oneself from abuse, and not really about disagreements over story direction.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Does that make it any clearer?

Whether or not the response is justified by the behavior of the GM, it's still turtling and it's still not a healthy element of play.  Turtling is always a response to feeling unsafe, whether that feeling is justified or not.  The healthy response to abusive GMing is to call the GM on his behavior or stop play.
