<img alt="image" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UyL3VzZXIvNzA1ODQ5LzE4MzQzMzAucG5n/original/g%2FiydZ.png"/><br/>For a little over a year now I've been working on Beam Saber, a mech focused hack of Blades in the Dark. Now it's <a href="https://austin-ramsay.itch.io/beamsaber" rel="nofollow">available in PDF</a> for those who want to pick it up!<br/><br/>Beam Saber is a game about the pilots of powerful machines in a war that dominates every facet of life. They are trying to do their time and part, and get out physically and mentally intact. The organizations that perpetuate The War through all of known space are too incomprehensibly huge to take down. There is no “winning” The War, there is only surviving it. Hopefully you can help others get out too.<br/><br/>If you're unsure about making the purchase, an older version of the game is <a href="http://tinyurl.com/beamsaber" rel="nofollow">available</a>.                </div>

                            The newest version of Beam Saber is <a href="https://austin-ramsay.itch.io/beamsaber" rel="nofollow">here</a>! Now with flashy cover art by <a href="https://twitter.com/QueenKhameleon" rel="nofollow">Vincent Patrick</a>!<br/><br/>The changelog is below, but the highlights include greatly expanded lore sections, and a section for those already familiar with Blades In the Dark.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D-ZqzUNWsAAbxCZ.jpg:large"/><br/><br/>Changelog for V0.42<br/><br/>     Clarified that the Technician's Simulation ability only applies to action rolls.<br/>     Removed "Should players be given information that their characters do not have<br/>    access to?" from Session Zero because it is superfluous.<br/>     Expanded on the lore for the Izyan Conflict.<br/>     Expanded on AWV lore to mention the Civilian Walking Vehicles.<br/>     Changed the "42nd Research Group" to the "42nd Naval Group" because I realized<br/>    that it would make sense for the DFS to have a dedicated aquatic squad.<br/>     Replaced mention of "fuel" on the spreadsheet pilot sheets with "quirk." Same for<br/>    "Devil's Bargain" and "Collateral Die."<br/>     Added a note that the "S" after a tier value means that squad as Strong hold, and the<br/>    "W" means that they have Weak hold.<br/>     Changed the description of Calazar Strategic Depoloyment to make them militarized<br/>    fans of a media franchise.<br/>     Added a "The Vehicles" subsection to The Basics section as a hint of the deeper role<br/>    vehicles play in the game.<br/>     Rearranged some sections' placement in the book for a better fit.<br/>     Clarified that a Pilot's player chooses what Scar they take.<br/>     Slightly expanded the Pilot Actions subsection in the vicinity of Pilot Creation.<br/>     Added to the History, Tragedy, and Opening sections that they provide XP when<br/>    expressed during play.<br/>     Added some clarification to the Regions section regarding how ratings are selected.<br/>     General formatting improvements such as adding bullet points, indents, bolding, and<br/>    italics.<br/>     Expanded the Allies section for greater clarity.<br/>     Added a section called "Familiar With Blades In The Dark" which highlights the<br/>    differences between Beam Saber and Blades for players experienced with that<br/>    game.<br/>     Created a "character sheet" for Regions. This is a tool to assist with keeping track of<br/>    Region details, but isn't required.                        </div>
