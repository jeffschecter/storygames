                    It's a hell of a question, isn't it? :-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on a mechanic for Misery Bubblegum where people get rid of their accumulated Angst by shifting from a mode where they can assert themselves in arenas <i>they</i> defined for their character, into a mode where they can only assert themselves by agreeing with what <i>other players</i> have said about their character.  So you go from saying "I'm smart, god-dammit!" to saying "My friend Lisa says I've got a good heart, and that counts for something!"  You become intertwined with other people's opinions of you, for better or worse.<br/>
<br/>
So I went looking through the source material, trying to figure out "Hey, how does this Angst thing come about anyway?"  And my conclusion is that the one thing I see happening most times Angst is generated is that somebody <i>rejects</i> your opinion of them.  They say, in essence, "This thing you think I am?  I'm not that thing."<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it's true ... they really aren't that thing.  Sometimes they're lying ... they totally are that thing, but they're telling you that they aren't.  Doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
That exchange undermines your sense of who the other person is.  And your role is defined in connection with other people (i.e. you aren't merely "A nice guy," you are part of a pair with (say) Malcolm ... you're The Nice Guy and he's The Cool Jerk).  So when someone undermines your sense of who <b>they</b> are, they also undermine your sense of who <b>you</b> are.  Hence the Angst.<br/>
<br/>
But my question ... my <i>question</i> here is ... why would anyone ever do that?  I mean, I get that if you hate the person and want to cause them angst then defying the image they create for you is a clearly good strategy.  But why would you deliberately defy the expectations of a person you care about?  Why do we hurt the ones who love us?                </div>

<p>Maybe because they have two incompatible relationship pairs and they have to choose?</p>
<p>Malcolm has, from you: "I'm the Cool Jerk, you're the Nice Guy". But his new girlfriend has: "I'm Malcolm's savior, he's sweet but misguided", linked to her opinion of you: "You're a bad influence, Malcolm is trying to please you." To win over his new girlfriend, he has to buy into her beliefs in some way... but that means he's not really a Cool Jerk, he just seems that way because you make him do jerk-stuff to fulfill your own needs. So who does he pick?</p>
<p>So, when Malcolm undermines your sense of who you are, it's not out of a desire to hurt. He wants you to redefine your relationship with him so that he can still have one, instead of just cutting you off completely to appease his girlfriend.</p>

                            Maybe, because who we are seen to be / who we are is not who we really want to be?

                            John:  I'll buy that in theory.  But in practice, what's the impetus to actually <i>choose</i>, rather than just string both people along by trying to be all things to all people?<br/>
<br/>
If I'm playing a character, and you ask me "Can you be a Cool Jerk and a Misguided Sweetheart at the same time?" my answer is going to be a rousing "Hell yes!  Watch me!"<br/>
<br/>
Does a player need, in practice, the ability to <i>take back</i> an opinion that they offered upon my character?  To say, "No, I'm not convinced ... you're so much of a Jerk that I don't think you're a Sweetheart any more."  Should that cause them Angst, the same as if I rejected the opinion?                        </div>

<p>Whatever the impetus, it can't be too strong. Obviously, people abandon some relationships, challenge others, throw themselves wholeheartedly into some, and dither about what to do on the rest. It's got to be their choice.</p>
<p>I forget the mechanics you were talking about for this game, but maybe one character can offer some kind of bonus for taking <em>their</em> side in a conflict between two relationships, and each time they offer, the bonus builds... but that bonus counts as angst for the character offering until accepted, so they are pressured to keep pressuring their target to take the bonus or cut off the relationship.</p>

                            People tend to take the existing relationships for granted, and get caught up in imagined relationships.  You see that all the time with people who have reasonably good relationships but still fantasize about the barrista at Starbuck's or the pool boy.  Buddhism talks about this at length, the first Noble Truth.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">American Beauty </span>is a masterful case study in the same thing. <br><br>In game terms, if you don't mind me going there, perhaps there's some differentiation between well-established traits ("My partner respects me as a hard-working cop who gets things done") and <i>fresh</i> traits ("My new love interest thinks I'm cool and ruthless!")                        </br></br></div>

                            Because these people want to be accepted, so they attempt to change and adopt another's opinion, but in the the end, their true nature emerges and that can cause hurt when a person's true nature varies from someone's opinion. The angst is caused by the friction between being what others want the person to be and that person being him or herself.

I suspect that the problem here is that identity (as in "I'm a good person" or "She's mean") and expectations ("he'd make a good husband for someone, if he wasn't so self-obsessed") aren't usually the <i>causes</i> of behaviour. They are the explanations and theories that we create after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a couple of young kids (let's call them Billy and Fred) are eating from a bowl sweets, and Billy takes the bowl and won't let Fred have any more sweets. Fred tries to take the bowl back and Billy smacks him one. So, why did Billy do that?<br/>
<br/>
Because he's greedy? Because he hates Fred? Because he's hungry and selfish? Out of revenge for something Fred did yesterday?<br/>
<br/>
The truth is, we don't know, and Billy won't tell us. So we come up with our own explanation, and act accordingly (let's say, we punish Billy.) Now, it doesn't matter if Billy tells us why he did what we did, <i>because we already know</i> and to think otherwise would be to admit that we had made a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
So, let's relate this back to the original question. Why would I reject the expectations put upon me by a person I care about? Because that other person is <i>wrong</i>. Even if the expectation is flattering ("he's so clever, he'll be a doctor one day") it has consequences, it places demands upon me, that I may not be willing or able to meet. And I may not be able to tell the other person that they are wrong, because they'll feel stupid, they may even feel that I have betrayed them somehow.<br/>
<br/>
So, I sit and I seethe and eventually I blow up because they bought me a stethoscope for my birthday and I don't want to be a fucking doctor and I cannot stay silent any longer. Foolish, but it happens.<br/>
<br/>
Is this what you're talking about?                        </div>

                            Why do we hurt the ones we love?<br><br>- Redirection: Some people feel negatively towards strangers or people it would be dangerous to lash out at (like a boss or co-workers). When they don't disperse or transform these negative feelings, they will often redirect them towards people that are safe (unlike their boss), like a loved one.<br><br>- Familiarity: We often have intimate knowledge of loved ones. The more we know about them, the easier it is to strike at their sensitive areas. Intentionally or not. <br><br>- Comfort: The more love someone has, the more trusting, open, and honest they can be towards a loved one. Truth can hurt.<br><br>- Convenience: People tend to be around their loved ones more than anyone else. <br><br>- Safety: Sometimes a loved one will let the aggressor get away with hurting them. This diminishes the possibility of undesired consequences.<br><br>- Attention: Some people may use negativity as a way to connect to a loved one. If the connection grows weak, even a negative connection is better than no connection at all.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Doug Ruff</cite>Even if the expectation is flattering ("he's so clever, he'll be a doctor one day") it has consequences, it places demands upon me, that I may not be willing or able to meet. And I may not be able to tell the other person that they are wrong, because they'll feel stupid, they may even feel that I have betrayed them somehow.</blockquote>So you hurt them a little bit <b>now</b> in the hopes that you won't hurt them even more <b>later</b>?  Yeah, that's something I'd been looking at, too.<br/><br/>I particularly like the idea of mixing that motivation with the opportunity for the person who offered you the opinion to withdraw it <i>themselves</i>.  If we say "Yes, you can withdraw an opinion of value X and only take angst X/2 (as opposed to the full angst X if someone rejects the opinion) then it opens up a whole new strategy:  driving someone else to lose faith in you, so that you won't have to betray their faith.  After all, they only suffer half as much!  Unless, of course, they refuse to lose faith in you, and indeed reaffirm their faith, in which case now they've got an opinion at X+1, and maybe you'd better just cut them deep before they start depending on you even more.  I mean, some stupid twits just can't take a HINT.<br/><br/>LOL ... also, if somebody takes away an opinion of you, and that hurts you so much that you want to hurt them in return, you have that wonderful flailing sense of desperation that prompts people to say "You're breaking up with me?  No WAY!  You can't break up with me!  I break up with you first!"  They've done you damage, and taken away your ability to do damage back, all in the same action.  The fact that the action hurts them isn't much consolation ... it doesn't hurt as much as they hurt you.<br/><br/>And I guess that, really, is the threat that makes you want to not just let it ride:  That if you give someone some opinions X, and they give you opinions X, then they can sever both ends of that relationship by taking angst X/2 and delivering you angst X.<br/><br/>If the situation was one in which trust is easy then that wouldn't be enough, but if you combine it with what John said about having relation-pairs that lend themselves toward conflict, then the trust becomes much harder to maintain.  It's a nice combo.

I'm glad if this helped, I love these threads you put out, even if I don't always get the mechanical bits. One small question before I go to bed: it sounds from your description that Angst is a bad thing and to be avoided. However, it's easy to avoid Angst by dealing with the problem when it's small - except this is not interesting in play. Shouldn't we be rewarding the player who <i>escalates</i> the situation more than the one who resolves it by "breaking up"? Apologies if I've missed a point from another thread.                        </div>

There's a sort of dollar auction vibe going through some of this that makes me think that the escalation might be built on something other than the obvious.  But if you can give me an example of how the angst gets dealt with easily at the very beginning, in a way that is clearly optimal, that'd probably help get us on the same page.

                            Why not reward them both in slightly different ways? You get some underhanded reward for having more angst and you get some type of popularity boost for causing angst to another character.<br/><br/>Like in the movie, Heathers. The Heather's cause angst to one of their friends, Veronica, but she actually is able to channel that angst towards the Christian Slater character and they go out and kill some football players. Without the angst, Veronica wouldn't have probably had the guts to join up with Slater. And the Heather's got more popular by getting down on one of their friends.                        </div>

                            Snap answer: reward them both. That way neither of them have an incentive to break it up.<br/>
<br/>
More considered answer: breaking up is fun too! (In a story sense.) So there has to be some variability, that encourages the build up and then the eventual explosion of the situation. I think we've been here before though.<br/>
<br/>
Another approach: if we're trying to model a real-world situation for our entertainment, let's look a bit deeper.<br/>
<br/>
Initially, the hassle from correcting someone's incorrect impression is worse than the hassle from playing along with it. So I go along with it.<br/>
Later, the hassle from playing along is higher, but so is the hassle from correcting it - because I am complicit through my earlier silence. I choose misery and feeling like I've done the right thing (by not hurting someone else's feelings) instead of conflict (by tackling the problem)<br/>
Eventually, I've had more than I can take (probably becasue other things in my life are also making me feel miserable) and taking on more misery from "sucking it up" is more than I can take. I have no other option than to start a fight, becasue I can no longer remain silent (this is of course a lie, but it feels true at the time).<br/>
<br/>
What does this tell me?<br/>
<br/>
1) If the misunderstanding is "triggered", I gain Angst.<br/>
2) The amount of Angst I gain increases over time.<br/>
3) Angst from different sources is cumulative.<br/>
4) I can only take so much Angst before I blow up. <i>I cannot choose when I will blow up.</i><br/>
5) If I <i>don't</i> blow up, my Angst will drop slowly. (Either something nice happens, or I've made it through the day and get some sleep.)<br/>
6) If I <i>do</i> blow up, I will lose Angst, and those around me will gain it.<br/>
7) If I confront the problem before I blow up, I will gain Angst, as will the people around me. This will be greater than the amount of Angst I gain from letting it go, at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
What's interesting about this is that sorting the problem out early isn't necessarily the best thing to do. If I'm close to the edge already, it may be easier to take a small Angst burden from letting something ride, than a larger one for dealing with the problem all grown-up like. As long as you keep pushing peoples buttons, they will blow up eventually, regardless of whether they try to resolve their problems or not.<br/>
<br/>
Does this match your understanding of how people get into these situations?                        </div>

                            Doug, that's a sensible model, but it doesn't match what I actually observe when I go to look at the fiction.  The first thing, really, is the biggest:  I don't see a reliable correlation between people misunderstanding character A and character A suffering Angst.<br/>
<br/>
But part of that is because the question of when an opinion about a character is <i>wrong</i> is so incredibly hard to answer.  If Malcolm comes across as a Cool Jerk, but Jessica thinks of him as a Misguided Sweetheart, does that make her wrong?  Not necessarily.  So you can't really look at the situation and say "Okay, this belief should be causing Malcolm angst."<br/>
<br/>
The thing I can find a strong correlation on is that when Jessica is presented with evidence that Malcolm is not what she thinks, that causes her angst, no matter whether it's true or not, and all that jazz.<br/>
<br/>
But that means that I can't make quite as simple a feedback mechanism.  It's not "Take angst, in order to be rewarded!"  It is, at best, "Induce other people to cause you angst, in order to be rewarded."<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, if you <b>want</b> other people to cause you angst then the experience is very different for the people causing the angst, right?  They're not hurting you or your character, they're helping you.  All of the (fun!) calculations that we've been talking about here ... do I hurt this person a little now, in order to stop them from being hurt more later ... go out the window if there's no hurt being dealt out.                        </div>

We're doing two different things here, just not at the same time:<br/>
<br/>
1) Working out why this happens (you original question, my most recent post)<br/>
2) Trying to turn this into a fun game (my sidetrack over reward,but also the reason why you asked the original question.)<br/>
<br/>
So apologies if I miss one thing by addressing the other.<br/>
<br/>
As for who is wrong, think subjective vs. objective. I've used a lot of "I" in the previous posts, to paint the subjective picture. Here's my take: objective truth doesn't matter. All that matters is that :<br/>
<br/>
- Malcolm thinks he is a Cool Jerk and acts accordingly;<br/>
- Jessica thinks Malcolm is a Misguided Sweetheart;<br/>
- Jessica puts pressure (consciously or unconsciously) on Malcolm to act as a Misguided Sweetheart. For example, by taking him to see a chick flick.<br/>
<br/>
How Malcolm then behaves will determine whether his Cool Jerk or Misguided Sweetheart Trait is reinforced. How this relates to Malcolm's self-image as a Cool Jerk  will determine how much Angst results. Malcolm may be fucked up, but he is the <i>ultimate authority</i> in how he feels. God, if that isn't teenage, what is?<br/>
<br/>
Finally: "blowing up" doesn't just have to be violent rejection - it can be a moment of <i>satori</i>. Let's say that Jessica sends Malcolm a cute stuffed bunny for his birthday, and he opens it in front of her and his Cool Jerk friends. They mock him, much Angst ensures, and Malcolm wigs out. He can reject Jessica's Misguided Sweetheart trait <i>or his own Cool Jerk Trait</i>, but he has to choose between the two. This sudden realisation that the other person is right about you (and often the right person for you) is a staple plot.                        </div>

If the player (through their character) is the ultimate authority (and I tend to think that they are) then there's no way you can ever force them to any character-definition that they don't want.

And I can cite you exception after exception to the idea that angst is generated whenever somebody says something contrary to your self-image.  It's an intuitively pleasing pattern that doesn't seem to match the evidence.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

One:  You can become something that you weren't before.  This is a strange reward, because I don't really think that's necessarily <b>better</b> (in the sense of empowering the player or making the character happier), it's just different.  I wouldn't want it to be (for instance) mechanical character advancement.  But it's damn fine story.<br/>
<br/>
Two:  You can offer something meaningful to other people.                        </div>

Hmm... in order.<br/>
<br/>
- Angst is a bad thing for the character, but it doesn't have to be a bad thing for the player. I'm suggesting that your target audience for this game will enjoy pushing each other's characters buttons, and having them pushed, so gaining Angst isn't going to faze them - particularly if it is also a resource for the player to fool around with.<br/>
<br/>
- Agreed with you that accepting both traits is a viable option as well. Under circumstances, accepting neither is also an option.<br/>
<br/>
- Agreed with your analysis, my observations are based on real-world psychology and you are definitely the expert between us on shojo. However, one subtle difference that may be important. I don't believe that having someone <i>say</i> something counter to one's self-image causes Angst. That can be laughed off or ignored. Having someone try to make us <i>do</i> something that is counter to one's self-image does - particulary if it causes conflict with another aspect of one's self image.<br/>
<br/>
Need an example for that last bit. The only reason Malcolm is getting angst from all of this is becasue he loves Jessica. If he didn't, he could just tell her to get lost, no Angst involved (for Malcolm, anyway.) So, from Malcolm's perspective, it looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
Cool Jerk: I want to keep this.<br/>
Misguided Sweetheart: meh.<br/>
Jessica's future boyfriend. Oh god I want this <i>but</i> that means having to choose Misguided Sweetheart over Cool Jerk. Nuts!<br/>
<br/>
And that is how we end up hurting the ones we love, I think.                        </div>

                            Doug:  Agreed, on most points.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to figure out a way to empower players through angst, but to screw over characters.  To be honest, though, I <b>think</b> that what I may want to do is have Angst empower <i>other people's players</i> to be able to make <i>your character</i> powerful in various ways.  Like, say you start with 5 points worth of Traits that you can place dice on (in order to be buff) ... and you can have a crisis to trade all five of those in for the chance to have the other players designate Angst-points worth of new Traits for your character, depending on what their character thinks of yours.  Then it becomes pretty clear-cut that you probably don't want to have a crisis at less than 5 points of Angst, but at the same time ... how much of your resource pool do you really want to pour into other people's vision for your character?<br/>
<br/>
As for Malcolm loving Jessica (and that being his vulnerability), I also agree .... but ... I'm thinking that his feelings of love would, in practice, be accompanied by his holding some opinions about her, yes?  So, if he believes that she'll reject <i>his image of her</i> unless he accepts her image of him then he's got the motivation to live up to her expectations, right?  I mean ... "My future girlfriend" may well be one of the roles that he offers her the chance to live up to.<br/>
<br/>
I know it's indirect, but I think that in order to be who <b>he</b> wants to be, Malcolm needs Jessica to be the person he wants her to be <i>with him</i>.                        </div>

As in, what's really causing problems is the Tension between "Jessica wants to be with me" and "I'm a Cool Jerk"?<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
Also, a thought. Remember I said upthread that Angst needs to go down over time if left alone. What if other players can "burn" your Angst to make nice things happen for you? But if they decide it's more fun to keep you stressed, they leave the Angst sitting there, and pile on more by playing on your Traits.<br/>
<br/>
The comeback for this is that if they do this to you, you can retaliate by choosing to reject them when you blow up (which dumps your Angst on to them.)<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if it works as an in-game economy without tweaking, but it feels like it could be fun.                        </div>

The Traits don't provide the "rip your guts out pain".. the players do. (Sorry if that sounds trite.) Take even a simple Trait like "I love my mother" and you can end up with <i>Oedipus Rex</i> (or <i>Psycho</i>) if you're already playing with that intent. Similarly, does it matter if a trait is self-serving, or appears narrow, as long as it sees play and drives the story?<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, look at Dogs. Some players come up with amazing, grabby traits, and others are sitting with a page full of simple verbs and nouns ("perceptive", "big gun"). The system still allows both players to participate equally and grow during play. If you expect the players to come up with amazing Angst-loaded traits all the time, or to know where to place their traits for maximum effect then there's going to be some "performance pressure" issues, and they'll get in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I like your "Beautiful" set up much better than mine. That's the thing: you already know what you're doing here. How does your system support me if I don't know what I'm doing? I'm being mean to you, to draw you out. I want your game to generate good play even if the initial traits chosen by the players are sub-par. Feel like taking that on?                        </div>

                            Well, I would hope that the strategy of the game, in fact, leads you to those gut-wrenching decisions.<br/>
<br/>
As Malcolm, you want to achieve two goals with your opinions:<br/>
<br/>
1. You want to change Jessica into the type of person who will support your image of yourself in a relationship with her<br/>
2. You want to prevent her from dumping Angst on you by rejecting your opinion of her.<br/>
<br/>
So if you do an opinion like "You're the type of girl who would want to be my girlfriend" then you're really driving hard on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but you're totally flubbing <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  She can dump that back in your face (and probably <b>will</b>), simply because she has no incentive to adjust her image of herself to match yours.<br/>
<br/>
If you do an opinion like "You're really smart and good at schoolwork" (and supposing that Jessica is a mousy school-girl) then you're probably well-shielded on issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> ... if the opinion lines up with her Traits then she has no reason to really buck it (unless she just plain wants to hurt you, no matter the cost).  But you aren't doing yourself any good on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, because you're not making her any <i>more</i> the kind of girl who fits you image of "Malcolm and Jessica, Boyfriend and Girlfriend."<br/>
<br/>
Whereas, if you run a middle course like "You're beautiful" then you bind both goals together in a nice little package.  You present the image that you want Jessica to fulfill in terms that are aimed to make it attractive to her.  It's an image that, even if it doesn't match her <b>now</b>, is something that she has decent odds of wanting to grow into.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense?                        </div>
