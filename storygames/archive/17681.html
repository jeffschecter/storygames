It should be sufficient to note that I've read <i>all</i> of these myself. With my extensive experience in reading indie rpgs I recommend that you go with Shock: it's on par with Mouse Guard as a compelling text object (thinking of physical books here, though), and it's an ambitious design that demands a lot from the reader.<br/><br/>After that it's either Don't Rest Your Head or Mouse Guard depending on whether you like brevity, pretty pictures, simple elegance, etc. Should be pretty obvious which is which.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400379/#Comment_400379" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T15:30:24+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  3:30PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading Monsterhearts right after Apocalypse World would be an exercise in game design/hacking thought - seeing where the game was plied in new directions, how certain ideas were inverted, and what got hacked away versus what was enshrined as "the core experience" of the apocalypse engine.<br/><br/>In other words, read it next if you want a creative/investigative endeavor. Don't read it next if you want to enjoy a text as its own autonomous creation. (Monsterhearts is enjoyable in that capacity as well, I think, but reading it right after AW would alter the reading experience drastically, IMO.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
