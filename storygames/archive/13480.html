It can even feel cheap. <br/><br/>But finding the perfect gift is a crap shoot. One strategy is asking what people want without actually directly asking. Or listening to the clues people drop about what they want (when they know but don't want to have to tell you). Even when both sides are indirectly communicating, it still can make the end result more satisfying than just saying it**.<br/><br/><span style="color: #666666;"><i>*Substitute buying with making and substitute Christmas with any gift giving occasion as desired,<br/><br/>**That said, plenty of people are perfectly happy just saying what they want or providing a list of options and the surprise and specialness comes in not knowing which options will be picked.</i><br/></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304126/#Comment_304126" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T21:56:58+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  9:56PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like money.

I'll think and see if there's anything I can add to it. The only thing I can think of at the moment is that I really like games where the protagonists are fully empowered to go after what they want themselves, so that they can *show* what they want for Christmas instead of you having to guess. Then the GM's role is back to playing antagonism and cheering on the players. I find that much more satisfying.<br/><br/>My very first experience GMing was spoiled when I fought so hard to give a player what I thought he wanted that I stepped all over what he actually wanted, leaving both of us frustrated, and me wondering why he wasn't grateful. It was like some kind of <i>Christmas railroad</i>: "Here, take this. No, really, TAKE IT. And LIKE IT. No, if you don't take it, rocks fall on your character and you die. You don't like it?

I was all over this thread's title because this was something I'd been thinking for a while. Some time ago I was even going to type up a blog post about how gamemastering/roleplaying is  like giving a present. The reasons are the same as the ones given here; you want to respect your player's wishes, but you also want to surprise them and the surprise is part of the point.<br/><br/>It's a particularly interesting point in the Korean RPG scene because there was this dust-up a while back, which never quite settled, about whether roleplaying should be pre-discussed or more spontaneous. (Yeah, when you think about it, about as meaningful as how many angels can dance on a pinhead. But you know how geek rage goes.) That discussion has left some bitter feelings in its wake, but I still think it raised a lot of thought-provoking questions.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I'd like money. A gift voucher is acceptable.</blockquote>\nTo expand on this, asking the player up front exactly what they want and giving them exactly that can be like giving a voucher or cash. The player will get exactly what he said or what he thought he wanted, but there's no surprise to it, and less active output from the GM.<br/><br/>It really depends on the person, I guess. I have a long-time player who hates surprises (and even dice) and likes to dictate exactly what will happen. We discuss the play beforehand, then roleplay (usually without dice). There will still be surprises along the way, because the character interaction usually takes the situation to places we hadn't foreseen, but it still follows the general guidelines we've set together. Other players would like some surprises and hate to "pre-play" the game. For them, I try to keep discussion to a minimum and hit them with plenty of twists and turns.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>[snip]I really like games where the protagonists are fully empowered to go after what they want themselves, so that they can *show* what they want for Christmas instead of you having to guess. Then the GM's role is back to playing antagonism and cheering on the players. I find that much more satisfying.[snip snip]</blockquote>\nThis is kind of the essence of both gamemastering and gift-giving for me: Watching and listening to see what they want. I use this equally for the "no-surprises-please" player and the "hit-me-with-your-best-shot" players. The better you know them, the more you watch and listen, the better you can give them; and the better they give back, in return, by showing more of themselves to reward me with continued joy and more surprises.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>John: yes! The first couple sessions kind of feel like a focus group for me, where I'm setting out toys and seeing what people will play with. Games that give the GM good feedback through character sheets always help a bit, but there's usually a fine-tuning stage.</blockquote>\nAnd that's why the beginnings of so many campaigns (and long stories in general, when you think about it) are so different from the overall tone and especially the end of the campaign. The beginning is often the "feeler" stage, when everyone is gathering information about what works and what doesn't. The GM, in particular, needs to watch and listen to the players. Once a working approach has been found, the campaign finds its pace.<br/><br/>I guess in the end, for me, it all comes down to listening, whether the cues are explicit or not. I've found that it's a good principle for both life and roleplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
