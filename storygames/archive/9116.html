It didn't go that great, but I suspect this had much more to do with the players than with the game.<br/><br/>I started by having everyone make characters. I used the quick start rules and this part went great. We created the characters fairly quickly, everyone got a cool character with a lot of detail in a short amount of time. The premise of "angels tentacled beasts not singing babies who get put on the mantel by old people and you kill them" was easy to grasp and was very grabbing. We had four characters: Ghidra- Mexican sorcerer who was super excited to find out that a coffee pot dealt twice the damage of a pistol, Redaction, another sorcerer who was a "Messiah" (aka attention whore), very mysterious who used shuriken, an investigator named "Joe" (I told him to pick a cool nickname...but whatever) with a chainsaw and a bad attitude, formerly a race care driver, and finally Thermal, a warrior with a revolver and an extremely greedy streak.<br/><br/>Things started as the cadre was driving through town past the local college when they heard a scream from the second story and a severed arm flew out the window onto their car. Stopping to investigate, they called one of their contacts (Jose, a gardener at the college) to get them in since it was after hours and they investigated the scene. Finding a dismembered naked corpse, they found that she was sleeping with a mob boss when some crooked cops burst in and after some not so subtle magic, started firing. The player of "Ghidra" started bitching like crazy when the cops shot him ("cops don't just shoot people!") but soon the fight was over and things calmed down. <br/><br/>The players then stopped by a whorehouse to find more leads after a meet-up with a police contact, found another corpse, and shook down a drug dealer for info on a jewel heist. The players then decided to steal the jewel themselves rather than try and stop the robbery, and one of them was beaten to death after staying behind to watch the car as the actual robber showed up and ganged up on him (which was OK, since his player had to leave anyways). <br/><br/>They then found an address that the diamond was supposed to be delivered to. They went there and found- you guessed it another murdered woman. They kept hearing strange noises and one of the players used a combination of magic and powered sugar to find the angel (the supremely creepy Aeshaum angel. I did a full print out of the art, and it scared the shit out of everyone, save the one guy who siad it looked too much like the Alien in Alien), hiding invisibly on the ceiling (revealed one scene before I had planned, but whatever). Anyways, the proceeding fight was epic. The one mage was unable to land a solid hit, and the warrior was doing little damage, although the second mage (Ghidra) went all out and used Ex Cathedra to turn his hands into circular saws to attack the angel. The angel then proceeded to launch a deadly stream of attacks, killing Ghidra in two rounds. The angel had been beaten down, and the back and kicking Ghidra (thanks to retirement) morphed into a demon, turned his hands back into circular saws and burned all his life and fury doing a suicide move to strangle it to death with saw blades- slicing it open and finishing it off with his coffee pot.<br/><br/>Overall the game was fun, but due to some unenthusiastic and frankly rude players didn't go that great. The player of the warrior was continually on his cell phone until I finally had to physically take it away (this was after he supposedly silenced it and then proceeded to get another call and start loudly arguing in the middle of what should have been a creepy investigation scene). Trying to squeeze cool descriptions of combat out of this group of D&amp;D addicted reactive hack and slashers was like trying to draw blood from a stone, and the one player just decided to be an ass and complain about how the dice mechanics sucked because he kept missing and then getting hit- despite his refusal even after insistence to use any fury or spells to aid him. Anyways, I'll think twice before playing anything with those two again. <br/><br/>Overall, Spite is a lot of fun- just try not to play it with players that you yourself will end up spiting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202716/#Comment_202716" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T03:50:26+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  3:50AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2009 3:51AM by Rafael.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite><br/>We had four characters: Ghidra- Mexican sorcerer who was super excited to find out that a coffee pot dealt twice the damage of a pistol, Redaction, another sorcerer who was a "Messiah" (aka attention whore), very mysterious who used shuriken, an investigator named "Joe" (I told him to pick a cool nickname...but whatever) with a chainsaw and a bad attitude, formerly a race care driver, and finally Thermal, a warrior with a revolver and an extremely greedy streak.</blockquote>\nGreat names and backgrounds! I love it. As for the coffee pot, that's a typo. Sorry! In the errata, it basically notes that you need to switch range and damage on a pot of hot coffee. So it should be range 2 (you can chuck it across the room at someone), and it's damage 1 (about the same as a knife).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite><br/>The player of "Ghidra" started bitching like crazy when the cops shot him ("cops don't just shoot people!") but soon the fight was over and things calmed down.</blockquote>\nWell, they're not supposed to, but it has been known to happen. It definitely happens a lot more often in the world of Pandemonium, naturally...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite><br/>Anyways, the proceeding fight was epic.

But yeah, it sounds like the team would have been better off if they'd gone for some more magic or stunts. Trying to take down an angel without these is a very dicey proposition (ho ho ho).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite><br/>Overall the game was fun, but due to some unenthusiastic and frankly rude players didn't go that great.</blockquote>\nI'm really sorry to hear that! It is tough to get a game going when the group just isn't into the core concept. I don't know what to tell you other than I hope that things go better next time around!<br/><br/>Regardless, thanks for posting the AP report -- it's really cool to see that people are throwing dice!<br/><br/>- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202808/#Comment_202808" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T14:58:02+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  2:58PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite><br/>As for the coffee pot, that's a typo.

Although that did lead to interesting roleplaying as Ghirda's player was continually looking for coffee makers to refill his ammo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
