After several rolls, and once the weaker party is beginning to run out of steam, the stronger party is very likely to win in the end (assuming they haven't been knocked out of the fight yet).<br/><br/>Is this how it feels in play?

The basic conflict system is pretty quick and goes over fast, so the inherent randomness isn't so good at all times. TSoY in general puts a lot of stock to after-fortune result manipulation, which I like myself: the players often only really consider whether they want to win or lose a given conflict after they've seen the dice and know whether they need to think about it.<br/><br/>A more important point is the matter of pacing the fiction, though. Extending conflicts is something you only do for conflicts you care about. In practical play I've felt that this has impacted player choices more than the fortune-lessening effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176008/#Comment_176008" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T04:29:20+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  4:29AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll point out that the math in TSoY very deliberately affords every participant a chance of success in every conflict, even Unskilled vs. Grand Master.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176092/#Comment_176092" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T13:26:29+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  1:26PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, that's a good point about the "spotlight" focus of an extended conflict, and how we might avoid one for something we don't care about just so as to move along. However, I really want to concentrate on the game design aspect of all this.<br/><br/>To continue with the TSoY example:<br/><br/>Yes, the system affords someone Unskilled a chance vs. a Grand Master. However, if the Grand Master has the option of extending the conflict (i.e. BDTP), those odds drop and drop and drop...<br/><br/>Is this one reason why it's a very good rule in TSoY for the Story Guide not to have the power to BDTP? Because then lucky low-ability PCs would never have a chance against the big NPCs?<br/><br/>(And, vice-versa, because it allows players to protect PCs from lucky unskilled NPCs?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176094/#Comment_176094" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T13:47:35+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  1:47PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2008 1:49PM by Marshall Burns.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a related (i.e. consciously informed by BDTP) dynamic in The Rustbelt.  Conflicts are run in a series of exchanges, in which each person does one thing, and each exchange is resolved by a two step process of dice and a mechanic called the Push, which basically is buying success when your roll fails, and the Price for it hurts.  A success puts the hurt on the other guy pretty seriously; Pushing puts the hurt on you, sometimes quite seriously (depending on the margin of failure).  In most combat situations, both sides can succeed, if one makes a successful roll and the other Pushes, so then they're <i>both</i> in a world of hurt.<br/><br/>The <i>conflict</i>, as a whole, is not resolved by the dice.  It's resolved by the players, through voluntary acquiescence.  F'rinstance, a fight ends when one guy decides to stay down and the other guy decides to stop kicking him (or, more often, when one guy runs away and the other decides to stop chasing, or one guy begs for his life and the other decides he doesn't want to kill him).  What the dice and the Push do is leave lasting effects that compromise the character, thus putting the issue of acqueiscence in a certain perspective.  It's all bargaining, pressure, and threat.<br/><br/>What it comes down to is <i>resolve</i>.  How much are you willing to lose to win this fight?  The bottom line of this is that, regardless of the involved characters' actual power levels, the winner is 90% of the time the guy who is willing to suffer the most in the process, the guy who <i>needs</i> it the most.<br/><br/>EDIT:  What I'm saying here is, to equalize between different levels of power, make MOTIVATION centrally important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176096/#Comment_176096" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T13:51:19+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  1:51PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the more skilled character is almost guaranteed to win an extended conflict.  The question is, is he prepared to take the 2-3 points of Harm he's likely to collect in the process?  The dice penalties (or even the loss of Pool needed to "heal" them) can be crippling.  And then what happens in the next scene when something important happens and the NPC opponent now has more Pool than the PC, or the NPC's lame 1-point hit rolls up to a Harm 5?<br/><br/>I think that's the answer to the question.  Like Burning Wheel "Duel of Wits" compromises or even just D&amp;D hit points, the question isn't always IF you can win, but at what PRICE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176097/#Comment_176097" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T13:53:59+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  1:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshall and Jason,<br/><br/>You're both right on!<br/><br/>So let me ask you this: what happens in those systems when two people are trying to kill each other?

If I'm GMing, that's awesome!  The only time you might really encounter the issue you're describing is in a PC vs. PC situation, since that's the only time both sides can potentially BDTP.  And, in those situations, ideally your social contract -- and not the incentives in the rules -- will help decide if BDTP is appropriate or if the less powerful PC deserves to win (if temporarily).

One dies, and the other has been quite terribly maimed (but is at least alive)<br/><br/>The procedures that differentiate between these are all Drama mechanics, informed by ablative resources.  See, you are mortally wounded/go into shock when you hit 20 "Blood" damage.  More than that and you're dead outright, but you actually decide how you allocate your damage (the attacker determines how <i>much</i>), so that doesn't happen unless you're complicit with it somehow.  <br/><br/>Now, at 20 Blood, you're dying, and you can't do anything, unless you do a Last Push.  The Last Push, like all Pushes, requires that you meet one of the following criteria, all but one of which draw from non-ability stuff written on your character sheet:<br/><br/>1.

That's why you can't BDtP against crocodiles or cliff faces or tentacular horros.  Just "people" (however weird they might look).  Part of that is becuase generally, people <i>don't</i> want to kill each other.  They want the other guy to stop trying to kill them.  They want the other guy to stop sleeping with their spouses.  They want the other guy to give them their wallet.<br/><br/>So if the fight goes on for a bit and one side starts losing the advantage, maybe he starts running, or begging for forgiveness, or he tosses his wallet to the ground and cowers beside a garbage can.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the fight really is between two guys who will happily die if only they can take the other guy with them, then it's probably going to be a drawn-out affair and the less-skilled guy is probably going to bite it.<br/><br/>EDIT: And that's what he gets for being stupid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176107/#Comment_176107" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T14:22:18+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  2:22PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>Part of that is becuase generally, people<i>don't</i>want to kill each other. </blockquote>\nThat's really really important in the Rustbelt, too.<br/><br/>I should also note that it doesn't often (if ever) come to two people who want to kill each other no matter what.

So if I'm really good at fighting, but you still win, I can extend the conflict, but I have to change it somehow, so it's not a given that I'm at an advantage here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also the thing about the loser (and extender) continuing at a disadvantage, which I at first thought would handle your problem somehow, but that would make it almost impossible for the weaker part to extend the conflict when losing.

Although I would like to note that I enjoy the rest of TSoY.<br/>\n<br/>\nPotential solutions for a BDtP type mechanic when sides are not evenly matched really depend on the style of game you are designing. In a game where you generally want to see the underdog get their come back, you could reward them resources for failing rolls. So they build momentum that would eventually allow them to topple a more skilled opponent. In a game that rewards player skill, you could involve some sort of rock, paper, scissor mechanic where hidden tactical choices can even the odds. Alternately, I like Dimfrost's solution of requiring a change of arena when extending conflicts. And then allow competitors to try to shift the focus to play off each other's strengths and weaknesses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176259/#Comment_176259" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T14:00:12+00:00" title="October 25, 2008  2:00PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's exactly the issue I'm running into. In TSoY it is avoided in many ways, because of the importance of Harm, the rules covering death as possible stakes, and the fact that only players can BDTP.<br><br>I'm designing a game where the loser of a conflict can extend it, continuing at a disadvantage, and simultaneously "escalating", so that if they fail AGAIN, things will be EVEN WORSE.<br><br>The problem I'm running into is that someone who is much more skilled/able (in the fiction) can keep doing this repeatedly until they do overpower the weaker party, with only a slight risk of actually failing for good and suffering those escalated consequences. <br/><br/>I like the suggestion to "change arenas". How do you work that into a game? Changing arenas by escalating to violence, for instance, is an obvious one. In situations where violence is already at hand, or not applicable (like a contest to do something without the other person noticing, say), how does that work? What does it look like?<br/><br/>(The other "fix" I'm considering is simply capping the number of rolls, like In a Wicked Age... - it's not terribly elegant, but might do the trick. I'm looking for better options, though.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176268/#Comment_176268" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T15:51:04+00:00" title="October 25, 2008  3:51PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Escalating up from violence?<br/>Maybe, increasing "levels" of violence (DitV has 2).<br/>Maybe, escalating from "standard", "impersonal" violence (a warrior or a soldier's violence) to something <b><i>more personal</i></b>, be it <i>bodily </i>violence or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Svante%20Landgraf" title="Svante Landgraf"><img alt="Svante Landgraf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Svante%20Landgraf">Svante Landgraf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176299/#Comment_176299" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-26T02:17:48+00:00" title="October 26, 2008  2:17AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My idea was not about escalating, as that doesn't really work well with violence.

And the stealth conflict ... changing arenas might mean that you're discovered, and might try to fulfill your goals with fast-talking instead?

For those not in the know HQ has two contest types, simple contests and extended. Simple settles the whole thing in one roll, in an extended contest we play out each action and counter-action. In an extended contest you have a pool of action points equal to your ability. Each round you bid a number of points from your pool. If you win your opponent subtracts a multiple of your bid from his pool. Lose, and you lose a multiple of points from your pool. Your bid represents how risky the action you narrate is.<br/><br/>Now the same logic applies, the longer the contest the greater the benefit to the higher skill. Over time they should average more wins. But the bidding system lets you alleviate that disadvantage. If you have a significantly lower skill you want to make high bids every round, so keeping the contest short. So it rewards throwing caution to the wind and launching an all out attack instead of settling in for a war of attrition.<br/><br/>The draft of HeroQuest 2 drops the pool based extended contests in favor of what is call the scored mechanic. In the new system there is just one roll for each round instead of action and counter-action. The results are compared on a table. The loser gets 1-4 strikes against him. The first person to accumulate 5 strikes loses. But the system of risky action still pervades and you can up the stakes on your action, so that your losses and gains are doubled (risky behavior does not need to be symmetrical)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176337/#Comment_176337" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-26T12:33:42+00:00" title="October 26, 2008 12:33PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2008 12:33PM by JDCorley.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I ran into with Dirty Secrets when I was playtesting (not sure if this ended up in the final document), but if someone lost the initial conflict, they very rarely "pushed" into a second conflict because our reading of the rules were such that they would enter the second conflict with far less resources than the first.
