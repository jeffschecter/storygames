Awesome!  Our Invasion phase was going to be with a broken, vicious, pacifistic (but violent!) Inquisitor who believed that there was nothing worse in the universe than war, and so we knew that it was going to be a nasty, dirty business of fighting against the church and its hierarchy in order to do the right thing, when the right thing <i>looks incredibly wrong</i> ... and that we'd have highlights of the lives destroyed and families displaced by the conflict, and we'd be dragging that moral weight the whole way through.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NPCs <b><i>defined</i></b> the situation in a way that was immediately easy to read, and inspiring.  As human beings we are interested in <i>nothing</i> so much as another human being.  Saying "The world is going to be a Sigfried-world" is a powerful way of leveraging that interest in order to inspire and motivate a GM and players to get on the same page about the situation in the same way they can (easily) get on the same page about a character.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce he pointed this out to me, I immediately realized that many, many manga and anime are structured exactly the same way.  <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranma_1/2" rel="nofollow">Ranma 1/2</a></i> has Ranma and Akane as protagonists ... but each episode centers around the ways that a third party shapes their world, and how Ranma and Akane work within that world.  The ever-growing ensemble of supporting characters provide a series of differently focussed and distorted <i>mirrors</i>, and Ranma and Akane see new things in themselves and each other in each one.  <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_Basket" rel="nofollow">Fruits Basket</a></i> is even more straightforward:  The story is nothing more than a series of episodes in which Tohru Honda (the lone protagonist) meets members of the Sohma family and comes to understand them, learning or deciding something about herself in the process.  That's literally all there is to the story ... it's quite formulaic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI <b>like</b> this formula.  I think it works very well ... it's immediately inspiring, and gets people thinking about stories they can do ("Oh, we totally need to do an episode that's informed by <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Ren" rel="nofollow">Tao Ren's</a></i> father ... get into the whole twisted world of the Tao family, and give the kid a chance to finally confront those demons").  It also works to produce an ensemble of deep characters for future play:  The NPC you centered around last session is still <i>present</i> in the next session (even if it's informed by some other NPC), and the PCs have gotten a better picture of that person, and made strong statements about themselves relative to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is ... I have <b>no idea</b> what steps a GM would actually take in order to make a character's personality and ... uh ... essence ... pervade the world and the situation.  I can sort of wave my hands in the general direction, and give examples of how I see it happening in games and media, but ... what are the STEPS?  It's formulaic ... what's the actual formula?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80835/#Comment_80835" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T07:51:35+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  7:51AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually begin at the motivation of said character.

Since all characters are made in the same way, this means that these "handles" will have things they care about (enmeshments), with associated goals or dilemmas, and a set of attributes which come from who and what they are. These will typically include attitudes, "articles of faith" (beliefs they hold more or less irrationally), and details of appearance and behaviour, based on one or (more likely) several character templates.<br/><br/>And they're introduced based on what the main characters are enmeshed with.

I'm thinking, above and beyond, that the traits and roles that work for a <b>protagonist</b> won't actually do as good a job for a supporting/focal-character.  Maybe you need a character-creation system for these episode-NPCs, but it's very different in its aims from the character-creation system for PCs.<br/><br/>Like, "Hero" would be a lame-ass role for a protagonist.  Oooh, you're somebody that people look up to ... yeah, that drains all the struggle and interest straight out of a protagonist.<br/><br/>Likewise, "Tired" is a lame-ass attitude for a protagonist to have.

I mean isn't the whole point that the GM designs and places his Figures of Note, thereby doing precisely what you're talking about? <i>The whole game</i> reinforces it. The initial roll into disposition. The way the game positions figures of note in the scene economy. And certainly the way BITs work to help interface NPCs into the situation (it's sort of what they've always done). How do you do it? That's how. If you want to know the formula, then start stealing. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, what else is there to do? Make it so the NPC has a spotlighted position in the narrative using the rules of the game, play the NPC to the hilt, and profit. I think perhaps you're making the assumption that you should have more control than you really do. NPCs are expressed in the way they are played, and there's only so much you can know about a character before you actually start making decisions and rolling the dice. That's what makes playing the game fun. I guess what I'm saying is that if you take steps to spotlight an NPC like BE does, then his essence will pervade the scenes (as long as the NPC is present and active). You just don't know exactly what that essence is until you actually feel it (though you can make educated guesses, as you describe in your post).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing that BE doesn't do is make it so that the FoN is immune from becoming dead/irrelevant during the phase. But I think that doing that would weaken the possibilities inherent in the conflicts. You probably don't want to sacrifice the meat for the garnish. Maybe that's wrong, though. Maybe BE would be a better game if spotlighted FoNs couldn't be killed, except possibly through the narration you get from winning the phase.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81003/#Comment_81003" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T16:45:35+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  4:45PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kintara - I think people are talking about something a little different than just 'play an important NPC' here...but I may be wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kintara" title="Kintara"><img alt="Kintara" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kintara">Kintara</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81008/#Comment_81008" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T17:31:32+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  5:31PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2007 5:33PM by Kintara.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Kintara - I think people are talking about something a little different than just 'play an important NPC' here...but I may be wrong.</blockquote>Is that what I ended up saying?

(A kicker)<br/>\n- The mood you want to create? (based on your gut feeling)<br/>\n- The characters' weaknesses? (based on looking at their cards)<br/>\n- What would be logical to happen next? (based on appropriate knowledge of backstory and continuity from previous games)<br/>\n- What the characters' relationship is with the NPC? (based on the players each defining a unique (or not) relationship with the currently non-existent NPC, and then you inventing someone at the nexus of all those relationships)<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are just some starting thoughts. (And, actually, I really like that last one).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I suspect that you (the GM) won't be able to do this without at least some input from the players.

Nothing.<br/><br/>Does a GM for <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> need to know what characters are coming to the table before he crafts his town?  Nope.  I run convention games with a pre-made town, and people make their Dogs (similarly in complete ignorance of what the town is going to be) and it works out splendidly.  The system is well-crafted to make the players prep and the GMs prep independent.  They don't depend upon each other.<br/><br/>Same-same here.  At least that's the goal.<br/><br/>Suppose I choose an Overbearing Guardian:  A teacher who is trying to keep the kids from ... whatever fun thing it is they choose to do ... for their own good, and with the best intentions.  Maybe they're supernatural investigator-scoobies, and this teacher (and his band of professional spook-hunters) is sweeping in to try to keep the school 100% totally safe and spook-free.<br/><br/>If a player comes in with an Obedient Bookworm then you may well get a story of a shy kid trying to find the nerve to insist on her own way against an adult who unthinkingly runs roughshod over her for kindness's sake.<br/><br/>If a player comes in with a Feisty Princess then you may well get a story of two potent personalities clashing at every turn until they find a way to understand each other and make peace.<br/><br/>Jaded Champion?  Maybe you get a story about the question of whether one even <b>can</b> know what's good for other people, and whether safety is all its cracked up to be.<br/><br/>The point is, I think that if you throw out a well-structured support character, they act as a mirror for whatever protagonist comes into their orbit.  You don't need to know how the two will reflect each other <i>before</i> the game.

Thus:<br/><br/>Jen had explicitly said she'd wanted more doomed romance for her character in our last campaign. So I made sure at three different NPCs were desperately attracted to Jen's character, Khaidu. Jen also had her character start as an exile from his barbarian tribe who was an outsider among the other PC's people.<br/>Eric had created a character, Brother Vedis, whose story was all about finding out the mysterious and probably appalling secrets of the magical chalice of which he was the last surviving guardian. So I made sure that two NPCs cared intensely about the chalice. (And a third, the crazed sorcerer guy, had some background on why Vedis's religion was more sinister than he thought, but that never came up much).<br/>You'd created a character, Yoshi, who was all about struggling with the appalling repression -- and internalized self-repression -- of women in the fictional culture. And she had a thing for Khaidu, of course. So besides the NPCs you specifically implied in your character generation (Yoshi's judgmental father and her mentor/seducer), I created characters who mirrored Yoshi's issues of power, powerlessness, family, and love.<br/><br/>Thus I created the characters who became major figures in the story:<br/><br/>Kaina: Yoshi's long-lost sister, a female paladin full of repression and self-denial, instantly crushing on Khaidu even as she wishes he were "civilized." She eventually became a huge deal, immensely intertangled with Jen's Khaidu and effectively "my character" in the story. (Hits Yoshi &amp; Khaidu).<br/><br/>Khan: The freakin' giant tiger of death, Khaidu's rival as an embodiment of aggressive, virile nature, and connected to the Chalice and Yoshi's family history. (Hits Khaidu, and secondarily Vedis &amp; Yoshi).<br/><br/>Archduke Corion and Baron Ran: Corion, the sort-of-rightful claimant to the throne, seeking Vedis' chalice to break the spell that kept him an aged man in a ten-year-old body, with utter contempt for the barbarian Khaidu, and demanding Yoshi's allegiance through his hold over her father, the Baron Ran (whom I'm not listing separately as he was very much your creation and doesn't fit into a discussion of my NPC-creating-method). (Hits Vedis, and secondarily Khaidu &amp; Yoshi).<br/><br/>Arianwe: The witch-queen, powerful and cruel, Yoshi's grandmother -- eternally youthful thanks to hideous magics -- seeking Khaidu's male energy to perpetuate her immortality and wanting her hands on the Chalice for the same unholy purpose. The arch-villainness of the piece. (Hits all three PCs).<br/><br/>There were also two NPCs I created who pretty much fizzled:<br/>Death-Her-Gift: A barbarian princess, a powerful, self-assured woman (in contrast to Yoshi), who was attracted to Khaidu and wanted him to rejoin the tribes. Jen thoroughly rejected this option, and since there was no dilemma or internal tension to exploit, I huffled this NPC off-stage.

Similarly, you can use a D&amp;D dungeon module written in general for almost any set of protagonists of the appropriate level because "we're goin' adventurin' to kill monsters and take their stuff" is hardwired into both situation and character.

I'll have pie.<br/><br/>I have a longer essay on this, but the nutshell is that most people still relate to concepts as people. They attribute motives, values, and personalities to the laws of the universe. Governments have kings and queens even if their only job is to represent the essence of a nation. It's why big problems always seem to have one guy responsible for it, and why people tend to attack that person as opposed to attack the problem. <br/><br/>Back in the long ago time, ancient man treated the world he lived in animistically, as if he lived in some bizarre Walt Disney film where everything could speak and was trying to help him get laid and defeat the evil whatever. But then something happened. A really WEIRD something. We started to be able to relate to concepts directly.<br/><br/>There is some genuinely strange wiring that has allowed us to address abstract concepts in a non-animistic way, almost as weird as the structural mutation in our larynx that enables us to speak. Heck, this trend has even gone so far as to render some of us better able to relate to concepts, but incapable of relating to people at all without a great deal of learned effort.<br/><br/>So as time progressed, and our knowledge grew (and thanks to that little mutation we call a brain), we came to find out that many of the things we thought were a 'who' were actually a 'what', until we reached a point where the only thing we could claim as God was within the unfathomable components of the universe.<br/><br/>Now let's jump to my bizarre mutant ability. For as long as I can remember, I have been able to create characters based on, well, ANYTHING. The gum under a schooldesk, the guest soaps you're never supposed to use, I mean ANYTHING. It works both ways too. For example, I have a very definitive idea of what kind of nightclub I would be, thanks to some unwitting help from my brother. Because it's such a natural reflex for me, it's been a bitch to codify the process, and I want to because it's so damn useful for an RPG.<br/><br/>In the system I'm working on, situations are almost exactly like characters. For example, a swordfight actually has wants, such as 'disembowlings' and 'severed limbs'. So while characters can pursue killing their opponents, any resulting 'waste heat' is used by the situation to achieve what IT wants. Because of this, it's really not that big of a stretch to just make an NPC out of, or based on, a situation, or visa versa.<br/><br/>And I'd love to discuss this at length, but at this point all my ideas are still pants, and I still haven't a clue how I'm going to make any money off all this damn underwear. But if you do want to discuss pie and boxers further, I'm here. Just don't expect it to make much sense yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81755/#Comment_81755" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T11:51:57+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 11:51AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cv - That's a great insight, like you I am not sure how to make it relevant but it's certainly on the same dartboard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81772/#Comment_81772" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T12:36:03+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 12:36PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>How complex are you thinking this central-focal NPC would be, Tony? Like, how many data points would go on their character sheet (or equivalent)?</blockquote>At the moment I'm assuming 6 key-punches.  That having been said ... these are not things that motivate <i>only</i> that NPC.<br/><br/>For instance, here's a write-up for Idol (somewhat stolen from "Princess" in the original character-setup):<blockquote>Idol (GM gets points when any NPC acts because ...)<br/>  - What people want the Idol to be is more important than what the Idol wants<br/>  - The Idol is better than other people<br/>  - The Idol must not give in to his flaws</blockquote>This gives the GM points for playing a spoiled celebrity, obviously.  But it also gives point for playing the celebrity's conniving agent (who knows that what the public wants is more important than what the Idol wants) and the spiteful has-been who detests the celebrity with a passion (because she sees him as constantly giving in to his flaws) and the fan-club, and the demanding father ... it gives the GM points off of a whole potential entourage of invested NPCs.  The GM gets to play the whole <i>cast</i> with an aim at the Key-punches.<br/><br/>One could, potentially, play a focus-Idol who is <b>not</b> spoiled, or uppity, or any of that stuff.  The Idol could be a simple, kind-hearted, humble kid ... and the GM could earn all of his points off of the actions of the rest of the entourage, orbiting around the Idol.<br/><br/>Damn, I suddenly realized:  That would be immensely tragic.<br/><br/>Anyway, I point all of this out because the idea of spinning NPCs off of facets of the central-NPC is close enough to what I'm thinking that it's jarring for it to be a <i>little bit off</i>, y'know?

That's why, if I was doing such a design, the focal NPC would be a nexus of other NPCs, probably listed off as relationship traits and whatnot.  The focal NPC's place of operations and essential/favorite/signature tools would be part of the statting-up process.  Basically, all of the things that will probably appear in play -- that's the situation.  Situation is STUFF.<br/><br/>You seem to be after, not the stuff, but the general tone and ways in which the stuff interacts -- the theme of "what's happening" and presumably the ethos that the players would be reacting to.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to be assuming that the GM will create little supporting NPCs (and props, and locations) on the fly, rather than prepping them before hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81874/#Comment_81874" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T18:54:44+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  6:54PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me the key to this idea is having parts of the spotlight NPC that can be transfered to other character but not used in a identical manner.<br/>If I was doing this in Burning Empires I would give out beliefs from the spotlight NPC to other NPCs. To expand on that the setting, minor NPC, and such all have a section that they copy from the spotlight NPC.<br/>In the Angel example I could see it coming about by making Angel with a Dogs in the Vineyard like list of open ended traits and then copy those traits to Kate and the monster but just a different take (and die allocation) on them.<br/><br/>In a system designed for this I would like those traits (Still thinking traits like in Dogs) to be transferable to the environment as well. What does the storm roll when the PCs try to travel through it? The same things the spotlight NPC could roll.<br/>This could really help to shape the feel of the game since the environment could then roll "Big and Mean 3d6" if the spotlight NPC had that. And if the spotlight NPC had nothing suitable for a storm to roll then its probably a good to use something besides a storm in the environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81888/#Comment_81888" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T19:48:00+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  7:48PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tj333</cite>To me the key to this idea is having parts of the spotlight NPC that can be transfered to other character but not used in a identical manner.</blockquote>"Transferred" seems (to my mind) to imply some separate book-keeping for each NPC.

They have traits, like 'Star-struck', and that implies some equipment like an autograph book.  It also implies some equipment in the form of <i>people</i>.  A star-struck NPC needs a star to be smitten with.  So that NPC comes with an autograph book and a celebrity.

Now Tanya's world may be a happy world from Tanya's POV or it may be a miserable one, but it revolves importantly around her.<br/><br/>The power of the PCs in such a game would have to be (I think) the fact that they are the people who can act in that world without being bound by its rules.  Every NPC in Tanya's world is played (by the GM) with a motive toward enforcing the patterns of that world.  The PCs are the people who can break or change a pattern ... and thereby save or redeem Tanya.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82012/#Comment_82012" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T10:14:45+00:00" title="July 18, 2007 10:14AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever I'm playing Spirit of the Century / Fate, I use major NPC and PC aspects directly as situation. Because aspects often have to do with beliefs or viewpoints, or common situations for that character, it's pretty easy to apply them as statements that can be true about the "world", too. So if one NPC has the aspect "Feelings are a useless luxury",  I might do a lot of plot events about the futility of relationships - lots of betrayals, miscommunications, people butting their heads against the proverbial wall. As different characters come into the spotlight and leave it, their different aspects dictate what kind of situations I introduce.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how useful such a device would be to you, though, because it doesn't suggest situation directly - mostly just provides a constraint to guide your thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82069/#Comment_82069" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T13:43:49+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  1:43PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I am pinching this.

This gives it a high rating. [I know, cake. Bear with me.] <br/><br/>Mechanically, this means that there is going to be one really important person, or two important people, or four kind of middling-important people, or (so forth) who represent the various attributes of X. Whatever their other attributes, they will be deriving most of their attributes from X, whether they are proponents or opponents, representatives or rulers, or simply "foils" - not directly connected with X but with some of its derived attributes. (Like, if X is an oppressive group, you'll see characters turn up that are oppressive or oppressed, even if they don't belong to X.)<br/><br/>We'll also see places, things and so forth that relate to X a lot - again, with its attributes and/or a direct connection to it. <br/><br/>The main characters are the people who have the potential to bring about change in X, and they'll do this by interacting with the supporting characters who represent X. But in doing so, they too will be changed; their attributes will gravitate towards being either the same as X or the opposite of X, because X is what they're defining themselves against.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82088/#Comment_82088" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T15:20:59+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  3:20PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike ... interesting:  Particularly the "gravitating toward what you change" bit.
