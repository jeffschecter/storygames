As Hunter and Changeling are my two favorites of the new line, I decided to combine them a bit. The players (there are only two) will start out as human hunters, and they will find themselves primarily going up against fae-type "monsters." Eventually they will attract the attention of one or two of the Gentry and be hauled off to Arcadia, returning as changelings, things they had learned to hate. What happens then I have less of a vision for (it'll be a ways down the road anyway) though I want the game to end with them rising to Wyrd 10 and becoming Others themselves, thus once again becoming the monsters they hated.<br/><br/>None of this is going to be a surprise to the players. I've already told them all of this, and they're on board. I have a few problems. I don't intend to run this as a game with a strong pre-planned plotline. I plan to sketch out some NPCs and relationships and come up with a few "weird things" the PCs might hear about at the beginning to start investigating. Beyond that (and coming up with more "monsters" from time to time as they deal with others) I plan to play it by ear, letting things be mostly player/PC driven.<br/><br/>My problem is that, for all I love Changeling, I'm not entirely sure how to do changelings as scary antagonists to hunters. The Gentry, and hobs, and other fae-things can be all kinds of monstrous, and changelings can certainly be as awful and evil as any person can. But they also seem to generally be more subtle. They're not generally drinking blood or tearing people limb from limb and the Mask generally keeps them looking human.<br/><br/>So does anyone have any good suggestions for things that changelings could do that would seem weird and paranormal if rumors were heard about them?<br/><br/>And as a side question: I'm pretty sure my players probably have the assumption that changelings won't be particularly terrible to face in combat. So I'd like to disabuse them of this notion by having them run into a nasty one fairly early. Anyone got any advice for making a particularly combat-nasty changeling?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205401/#Comment_205401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T12:17:03+00:00" title="May  5, 2009 12:17PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2009 12:18PM by Brand_Robins.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first suggestion is to not let the Hunters easily know who is a Changeling and who is a Hob or a Fae. The supernatural is difficult to understand, after all, so the Hunters may not easily be able to tell one from the other. <br/><br/>Once you've done that, the Hunters may never know what they're facing in combat -- it could be a Changeling, or a Fae, or something else. <br/><br/>The other thing about it is that it may allow you to relax the "Changelings as the Heroes" motif in your own mind. Once you look at them from the outside, Changelings can be pretty fucking scary, and as Clarity declines they're not all that subtle at all. Beasts and Ogres who lose their Clarity are like to eat people. And as people don't like to be eaten, there is likely going to be a struggle involved -- blood, tearing, screaming. Or a clever Ogre may well keep folks chained up in a pantry for when it wants to eat, so you've got all sorts of nastiness to work with human food, chains, pots, and big cold rooms to keep the meat fresh. Fairest and Wizened make good "inside killers" -- black widows who kill of husband after husband, or butlers who really did do it... over and over again. Serial killers are always fun, and magical serial killers are even more fun. Darklings make for good kidnappers, and Mirrorskins are always fun for a "kill and replace" caper. <br/><br/>It'd also be an interesting thing to have the players, once they're Changelings themselves, review their old cases -- now that they're the monsters they once hated, they may realize that in their past lives they weren't the saints they thought they were.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205407/#Comment_205407" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T12:35:38+00:00" title="May  5, 2009 12:35PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>It'd also be an interesting thing to have the players, once they're Changelings themselves, review their old cases -- now that they're the monsters they once hated, they may realize that in their past lives they weren't the saints they thought they were.</blockquote>Definitely.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But, while I'm not sure how long I want this game to go on (I intend to move it along at a fairly brisk pace for a WoD game) there were definitely be several sessions before that transition happens.<br/><br/>This is great advice though, Brand.  I'll definitely have to look at the Clarity chart and think about having a changeling or two that is hitting low Clarity levels and starting to really lose it.<br/><br/>No real worries about the Hunters knowing the difference.  At this point even my friends don't know the difference as they haven't done much/any reading of the books.  For example, one of the characters first encounters with supernatural was accidentally killing a coworker when he tried to break up a drunken fight between the man and his wife.  When the guy feel and broke his neck, I described the body falling apart into moldy leaves and bits of rusty metal.  They asked "Is that some kind of changeling thing?" and I just said, "Yeah, something like that."<br/><br/>I think my problem is not so much that I was thinking of changelings as "heroes" as that I was thinking more about "starting level" changelings.  I mean, even a new vampire is going to be going around and drinking blood.  But what's a new changeling do that'll get monster hunters going?  Glamour harvesting doesn't usually have any negative side effects, does it?  They can form pledges and enter dreams, both of which aren't things that are immediately obviously supernatural.  So, yeah, I could have a low Clarity Ogre eating people (and I do kind of like that idea!) but there could also be an insane human that eats people.  I guess I'm still hoping to find a good angle with Changelings that makes some of what they might do jump out more as weird in a supernatural kind of way, at least to people that are looking for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205413/#Comment_205413" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T13:06:32+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  1:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I see. <br/><br/>You're quite right that there are human cannibals. So the trick is to put in cues that let Hunters know its their business rather than the cops. <br/><br/>I think some of it would have to be in the forensics. Like, an Ogre might eat the bones. Or leave bigger than human jaw sized tooth marks in the bones he didn't eat. <br/><br/>Or a darkling kidnapper might snatch someone out of a locked room. It might have started looking like a "normal" serial kidnapper, until the victims started vanishing out of police custody or something like that. <br/><br/>I'd look to both the gifts and contracts, look to places where Changelings can do things that other people can't, and use those for the problems. Someone freezing to death after a fight with his girlfriend might not normally be too weird, but if its in Southern California in the middle of summer it sure as hell might stand out....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205417/#Comment_205417" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T13:27:54+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  1:27PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of things:<br/><br/>First, the challenge with any White Wolf game (or any detailed game in general) is not finding a new thing to incorporate, it's mercilessly cutting things out.  You are never going to get across all of ANY White Wolf game, let alone any TWO White Wolf games.  PS if you did it would be terrible.  <br/><br/>So once you have a basic setup, and it definitely sounds like you do, you should make a little circle on the center of a piece of paper marked "THE PCs", draw arrows pointing towards that circle and each arrow is a method of applying pressure to them.  That can be a Changeling that needs their help as privateers rend reality to re-capture them.  That can be a fae spirit or hob of some kind that's trying to get set up in the real world and need to bump off the PCs to do it.  Whatever it happens to be, that pressure is what makes the actual scenarios have dramatic tension.<br/><br/>When you read through a Changeling book now that you have a campaign idea in mind, you shouldn't be thinking "oh that's cool, I can put that in", not anymore, you've done the brainstorming, now you are an editor.  Now you should be thinking, "Does that push me in the direction I want the game to go or in another direction, or in no direction?" If the answer is "wrong way" or "doesn't matter", do not, <i>do not</i> use or introduce it and discourage discussion of it at the table. <br/><br/>I used a Changeling-related bad guy in my current game of mortal immigrant smugglers/organized criminals.  (Naturally Changelings have to get across a border into a land that doesn't want them, they need new drivers licenses and birth certificates and they're being chased by grim uncaring authorities far more powerful than them, and their sole reason for doing it is because they crave in their heart of hearts a better life and know that this is where they belong.  <i>Goddamn Changelings coming into this country and stealing our jobs!</i>)  I introduced some Changelings and they were initially sympathetic, indeed, some low-ranking ones were outright friendly to the criminals that gave them their start, but I made it crystal fucking clear that when it eventually comes down to you or them, they never, ever <i>ever</i> pick you.  It is always them.  That let me have enough tension that the characters still regarded them as creepy and stayed away from them, but it permitted the kind of information sharing that was necessary to banish the Gentry back to his prison.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205429/#Comment_205429" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T14:04:08+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  2:04PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're a smart man, Corley, and clearly a better GM than I will ever be.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I fear I may not have the self-discipline necessary to avoid trying to add stuff because it's "cool."  But I think you guys have given me some good ideas here.<br/><br/>I actually really like the idea of "changelings as immigrants."  Neither of the PCs would be people that anyone would be going to for help sneaking into a country or anything, but it seems like a good way to possibly have the PCs come across a changeling in a somewhat sympathetic manner, which is how I'd like to start.  I think they need to meet a semi-sympathetic fairest or wizened before they meet a human-eating ogre.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>You are never going to get across all of ANY White Wolf game, let alone any TWO White Wolf games.</blockquote>You're right.  But... at the moment I want to approach this more like two separate games that will happen to be linked by the PCs being the same.  So right now we're not playing Changeling.  We're playing Hunter.  Just with the understanding that at some undetermined but definite point in the future, the hunters will become changelings.  I'm going to stick with Hunter mechanics, probably using the Dread Powers stuff for fae/hob/changeling NPCs (unless I'm pulling them out of Night Horrors) at first.  Later I'll start pulling more Changeling mechanics just to get used to them myself if nothing else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205434/#Comment_205434" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T14:21:51+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  2:21PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2009 2:22PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, sure, to some degree you want a large variety of cool things, though I would hold back on most of them until they are torn from their lives and plunged into the new and horrific world they only got to scratch the surface of before.

The Hunters could hear word on the street of somebody who can make you rich, famous, good-looking, even a kung-fu bad-ass, in exchange for a few "small favors", that'd probably get their attention. Even if they don't hear those rumors directly, when one gang member gets Resources 5 and another gets Allies (Police) 5 literally overnight, that's going to set off a few "this is something unusual" alarm bells when those merits start getting put to use against other gangs.<br/><br/>(And of course, both those gang members, as well as anyone else given similar boons, are going to owe the changeling in question some significant favors. And when the pledges run out, well, maybe that Changeling wants something a little more extreme in order to renew it. Once you've had a taste of power and influence, it might be hard to go back to being a nobody.

They'll lose the benefits of their Professional Training, they'll probably lose any Endowments they had, and if they have many Tactics, they may lose those as well (after all, if you're not practicing your tactics regularly for 5 years because you've been enslaved by the Gentry, you're probably not going to be able to use them effectively anymore).

That pleases me.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206661/#Comment_206661" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T08:33:18+00:00" title="May 11, 2009  8:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>I think they need to meet a semi-sympathetic fairest or wizened before they meet a human-eating ogre.</blockquote>Yeah, so I totally didn't do this.

So far they've found out about:<br/><br/>-Several children who died a few months apart, all from one apartment complex, all of whom adopted a pet shortly before their death, and the pet was gone shortly after. (the bunyip from Grim Fears)<br/><br/>-A homeless man who accosted a couple joggers on a bridge on a local bike path, and hospitalized one when he refused to pay the "toll" (long-tooth tom from Grim Fears)<br/><br/>-One PC talked to bartenders who mentioned A) a man who had no ID when carded and later vanished, though none of the people around saw him leave, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> teenagers who bragged openly about their fake IDs, but when carded, said IDs turned out to be completely legitimate as far as anyone could tell. (this is the NPC who might not be as terrible as the others, but they're more likely to be checking out the previous ones, or the next one)<br/><br/>-Bodies disappearing from a local graveyard.  The other PC hid in the place for two nights, and saw another body crawl out of the ground.  Then a person came out of the shadows behind him and tried to put a knife to his throat, at which point the PC shot him, probably to death.  This was a gravewight darkling who was summoning ghosts to inhabit and animate bodies and binding them to his service with pledges.  I'm not really sure why yet, and I was at first disappointed when my friend rolled well enough to kill him before he was able to successfully activate a power to disappear back into the shadows, but now I'm thinking this will actually be cooler.  The ghosts are now free of their pledges and who knows what the hell they'll do?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206684/#Comment_206684" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T09:32:50+00:00" title="May 11, 2009  9:32AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah especially for the sheer joy of witnessing the players' amazed faces when they discover how, in their previous life, they became synonymous to plague among the changeling. The risk of the changeling community adding two and two and realizing that those two guys were the scourge of the "black days" of yonder should add some nice pressure too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
