I've played in several single sittings, as well as having run a season of the game.  But I haven't played it in probably 18 months, now.<br/><br/>One of the neat things about the game, I find, is that each time I play, I learn a little bit more about the game.  Clever, creative ways to use basic moves, conditions, or strings.<br/><br/>For example, the last time I played a game, I played The Neighbour, and I was deliberately trying to play with Strings.  And I had a wonderful experience where The Queen (who I was sleeping with to try to make my beat friend/crush jealous, and he was just using me for fun) tried to abandon me and run away, after I managed to anger the wrong person and get myself attacked.<br/><br/>I spent a string to force him to hold steady, in his attempt to abandon me.  The Queen got to his car, put his hand on the doorhandle, realized that, "Fuck... A little part of me does care about her, and can't abandon her." and grudgingly came back to help me.   Not that he would ever have admitted that out loud.  But it felt real and character growthy, and was a stand-out moment in a very fun session.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering, what examples of cool uses of the basic game toolset do you folks have?  <br/><br/>If it matters, I'm especially intrested in interesting ways to use/outcomes from Gaze Into the Abyss;  I've seen interesting uses, but never really seen interesting outcomes.  I feel like I may just not 'get' it.  But I'm really happy to read anything interesting you guys have done, because it's a game that's full of surprises.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455392/#Comment_455392" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-30T19:43:17+00:00" title="July 30, 2016  7:43PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you will need to read this link, ASAP:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18093/monsterhearts-roll-to-gaze-into-the-abyss" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/forums/discussion/18093/monsterhearts-roll-to-gaze-into-the-abyss</a><br/><br/>As for examples, I have one rather non-kosher one, from an earlier Story Games thread:\n<blockquote>I played <i>Monsterhearts</i> tonight, and was directly inspired by that little tidbit. Our Werewolf met the Mortal (his spurned ex) on the school steps, in the cold rain. She'd just been knocked over by some girls who are bullying her, and her glasses went flying. So the Werewolf stepped on the glasses, deliberately breaking them, then pressed them into her hand, cutting her palm.<br/><br/>We rolled "lash out physically", and it was perfect (he got a String on her through Primal Dominance, as well). Better yet, he rolled a 7-9, which meant he had to choose a downside, and the only option that made sense was that she gained a String on him, as well: you see, the Werewolf was trying to be tough in front of the people watching, but we all know that he still cares for her. She was looking so pitiful, sitting there in the rain, that the guilt racks him intensely, though he doesn't let it show.<br/><br/>So thank you for sharing that! It created a great moment in our game.<br/><br/>(We didn't count it as harm, though we decided that it left a scar - the scene was a flashback, after all.)</blockquote>\n<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin" title="Colin"><img alt="Colin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin">Colin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455393/#Comment_455393" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-30T19:55:27+00:00" title="July 30, 2016  7:55PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2016 7:55PM by Colin.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good example, thanks Paul!<br/><br/>And thanks for the link; I maybe should have thought to search, though it's hard on a cell.<br/><br/>I'd still love to hear more of people's stories, though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455394/#Comment_455394" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-30T19:56:48+00:00" title="July 30, 2016  7:56PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No problem!
