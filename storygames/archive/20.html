<p>You know all those old fogies on ENWorld and RPG.Net and at cons who ramble on about those awesome D&amp;D games their friend ran in highschool? Yeah, well, I'm never going to be able to do that, because I got indoctrinated by the Forge in 8th grade, and, like Jason said yesterday, you can't close your eyes again. And that fucking sucks. I want my nostalgia, man.</p>
<p>But in order to get it, I need a system that gives me D&amp;D-style campaign play and strategy without D&amp;D-style passive aggressive bullshit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, Burning Wheel. But there's an incredibly large chance that some of the guys in my gaming circle--one or two in particular--just totally aren't going to grock it; that, or they'll have to spend so much time considering all the factors and fiddly bits that things will take for-fucking-ever and the pacing will just be shot to hell. Plus I suck pretty badly at scripting. And then there's the minor matter that we're all poor-ass highschool students, and they'd rather read over a .pdf that I send them than shill out $25 plus shipping and handling for some more books.</p>
<p>Also, I love writing games, and am always happier running stuff that I've written myself.</p>
<p>In short, I want to write a really good fantasy heartbreaker.</p>
<p>(Be warned, this is a bit lengthy.)</p>
<h1>Past Attempts</h1>
<p>I've tried before a couple times, by which I mean like ten or fifteen. I've posted about a few of them. About four of those got to a point where they might be playable, but I'm not really that happy with any of them, and none are playtested or really complete. Each one was influenced by all of the prior attempts and everything I'd played, seen, and read in the meantime. Each is better than the last.</p>
<p>I've gotten to the point where I want to give it another shot, and this time actually finish and play the fucking thing so that I can bitch about how much better things were twenty years ago when I'm 40.</p>
<p>My goals and methods and techniques and shit, compiled as a result of all these failed prior attempts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crystal clear IIEE and stakes setting. Unlike in Pagoda, which SUCKED ASS in that department.</li>
<li>Simple d6 dice pool mechanic.</li>
<li>Big Messy Conflict resolution after the fashion of <em>Sorcerer</em>, rather than tSoY or BW or D&amp;D. By which I mean, a general conflict resolution system that's presented as a combat system and really <em>is</em> mostly a combat system, but can be applied to other situations when you don't want a single die roll to decide the conflict and there are lots of people trying to do lots of stuff at once.</li>
<li>Injury system where wounds result in dice pool penalties, but characters can ignore a portion of their penalty if they're badass.</li>
<li>No fucking skill descriptions to write up. If I want to write up lists, they'd better be lists of stuff that's <em>damn</em> interesting. Not fucking <em>skills</em>.</li>
<li>A short list of broadly applicable modifiers. Including the rule of currency. Something like what I talk about in this RPG.Net thread: [<a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=240001]" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=240001]</a></li>
<li>D&amp;D style spell lists, because wizard-on-wizard conflict in D&amp;D is my favorite thing to come out of an RPG ever.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What I've Got So Far</h1>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Characters divide 14 dice between Deeds, Words, Lore, and Will, putting 2-5 dice in each. They then pick a Role, which gives them a descriptor for each attribute (or, if they want, two descriptors in one attribute, and one descriptor in two others, and none in the last). Then they pick a Talent, which gives them another descriptor.</p>
<p>So a character's basic stats might look like this:</p>
<p>Jim the Knife<br/>
Role: Assassin<br/>
Talent: Calligrapher</p>
<p>4d Deeds (stealthy, assassin weapons)<br/>
3d Words (deception)<br/>
3d Lore (poisons)<br/>
4d Will (calligraphy)</p>
<p>Tests are called for when characters are attempting a difficult action with consequences of failure, trying to do something better than another character, doing something being actively resisted by another character, or the player meeds a bunch of dice for something and wants to make a linked test. Roll a pool of d6 equal to the appropriate attribute + modifiers. Always roll at least one die. For each 6 rolled, throw another die. Total 'em up.</p>
<p>Your DOS equals the tens digit of your total. For unopposed tasks, you succeed on a 10 or more. For opposed tasks, you <em>also</em> have to score <em>at least</em> as high as the other guy. If both of you roll less than 10, mutual failure. If you both roll more than 10, but get the exact same total, mutual success. The other guy's roll doesn't affect your DOS: if Alfred gets a 33, and Bartholomew gets a 32, Alfred wins with a DOS of 3.</p>
<p>Modifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>+1d for having a relevant descriptor.</li>
<li>GM assigned penalties for doing stuff you don't have the expertise or training for. Like a peasant using a bow, or a butcher attempting surgery. If the penalty would be more than -3d, the character probably shouldn't even be able to attempt the task.</li>
<li>GM assigned penalties for especially difficult unopposed actions.</li>
<li>Resources, including time, money, and calling in favors. +2d for using way more (like 10x) than you need to. +1d for using much more (like 2x or 3x) than you need to. -1d for being on a tight budget or having a bit less than you'd like. -2d for having only like half of what you'd normally need. -3d for having the bare minimum to even make an attempt.</li>
<li>Tie-in. +1d for describing the action in a cool, clever, tactical, or vivid fashion that makes use of the environment. -1d for describing it just like an earlier action, or in a tactically unsound fashion.</li>
<li>Currency. The DOS of any roll can become bonus or penalty dice on a related roll.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to apply bonuses after you've already rolled dice for some reason, just roll and add some more dice. If you need to apply penalties after rolling, take away 4s, then 3s, then 5s, then 2s, then 6s, then 1s.</p>
<h2>Combat, But Really It Works For Any Type Of Direct Conflict</h2>
<p>Declare actions in the free and clear. If two people are being whiny dorks and keep changing their actions based on the other guy's changes, then the one with the lower Deeds MUST declare first, and then can't change in response to the other guy. Figure dice pools for actions, but not defenses. Roll them. Resolve actions in order of highest total to lowest.</p>
<p>Defenses are rolled as they become relevant. You can only defend if you've already acted, chose to do nothing but defend (in which case you get +1d), or choose to give up your action for the round. This goes for resisting spells as much as evading mundane attacks. In close combat, the DOS of your defense against a character becomes bonus dice for an attack against them next round.</p>
<p>This is, of course, pretty much directly ripped from <em>Sorcerer</em>.</p>
<h2>Ouch</h2>
<p>Characters have a Toughness equal to Deeds + Will (+1 per relevant descriptor). This is used to determine scratch, flesh wound, severe wound, and mortal wound ranges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unharmed: 0 or less, no associated penalties</li>
<li>Scratch: 1 to (Tgh/2 -1, round up), -1d if you have at least your Deeds in scratches</li>
<li>Flesh wound: (Tgh/2, round up) to (Tgh -1), -1d each</li>
<li>Severe wound: Tgh to (Tgh x1.5 -1, round down), -2d each</li>
<li>Mortal wound: (Tgh x1.5, round down) and up, -3d each, automatically disabled</li>
</ul>
<p>When a character is injured, roll 1d per point of the attack's DOS, add a bonus for weapon, subtract a number for armor. (Some non-attack stuff, like some spells, instead Nd of harm, -1d per point of DOS on a test to resist.) Unlike in tests, sixes don't explode. Compare the result to the character's wound ranges to find the severity of the injury.</p>
<p>Wound penalties apply to all Deeds rolls. Between the round during which a character's wound penalty went up and the next, a character may test Will. If they fail, they are disabled by the pain. If they succeed, their wound penalty is reduced by their DOS. Multiple Will tests overlap, and you can never reduce your wound penalty to below 0. Getting first aid reduces your wound penalty by 1d until you get yourself injured again.</p>
<p>Scratches heal in hours. Flesh wounds heal in days. Severe wounds heal in weeks. Mortal wound heal in months.</p>
<p>Part II forthcoming.</p>

<p>Part II</p>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>Spells have a Burden. When you cast a spell, test your Will. The result of this test is used for three things: first, each point of your DOS reduces the amount of Burden taken by one. Secondly, a higher DOS can make the spell more powerful. Lastly, when using the combat rules, it determines when in the round the spell happens.</p>
<p>Burden is added to a character's wound penalty. It disappears at a rate of 1/hour of light activity, rest, or sleep. Wound penalty dice from burden can be ignored with Will s easily as those from injuries, but first aid won't help you here.</p>
<p>When working on a spell that takes multiple rounds to cast, you can't do anything, not even defend. So it's a good idea to just chop down the casting time and soak up the Resources penalty to your Will roll, or to have some defensive spells up and running.</p>
<p>Characters can prepare lengthy spells for quick release or store spells they don't have memorized in their brain by Binding them into their mind, Jack Vance style. Binding takes a long time, and makes you twitchy, but lets you release the spell as a single action with no penalty to your Will roll, no matter the normal casting time.</p>
<p>A character can't have more sustained + bound spells at any one time than their Will. Having sustained and bound spells makes getting rid of Burden take a lot longer. Characters that are injured or lose consciousness must test their Will, and, if they have more sustained + bound spells than their DOS, lose all the excess ones.</p>
<h1>What I Need To Do</h1>
<ol>
<li>Get feedback from you kind folks and my gaming buddies.</li>
<li>Write up 3-4 benchmark spells for each Burden value of 1-5</li>
<li>Play structure and reward cycles and character growth. Ideas?</li>
<li>Playtest, playtest, playtest. Make sure it does what it's supposed to.</li>
<li>Write a first draft of the final thing, with examples and stuff.</li>
<li>More feedback and playtesting.</li>
<li>Revision.</li>
<li>Publishing, as a free .pdf on the 'net.</li>
<li>Buy art and revise more and redo layout and sell it, if it's good enough.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, this will turn into something that totally kicks ass. It's a bit bland at the moment though. It needs something to spice it up. Which, I'm thinking, is because I haven't even thought about play structure and reward cycles yet, which is stupid, because they're rather important, and I need to get up on fast or this will bomb.</p>
<p>So, that's want I want to talk about. How all This Stuff That I've Written could synergize with reward cycles of different sorts. Right now the only cycle present is Doing Stuff Begets Success At Doing More Stuff, due to the rule of currency. But there must be a way to motivate people to Do Stuff in the first place. Something along the lines of Keys/SAs/BITs, perhaps?</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

Add some Keys or whatever, but keep them your own. I really think that feature is needed, if I'm gonna play (that's not a threat, it's just my groove, wakatta-ju know what I mean?). Also, gimme your magic system, but let me do it with everybody. I want my FF, I want Knights stepping in front of attacks using their magic and Dragoons leaping into the air with their magic and Kung Fus moving faster than the eye can see using their magic. Otherwise, I'll play your game if you'll let me.                        </div>

                            It looks really cool so far. Elegant and expressive. <br/>

I don't see a reward system in there though, and that (to me) is the most important part of a game. How are players rewarded, and for what?                        </div>

<p>That's the sticking point, ain't it? And I've been thinking a bit on the issue since I last posted. There are three big influences to this game's aesthetic. First, the original Dying Earth short stories. Secondly, the Black Company novels, most especially <strong>The Black Company</strong>, <strong>Shadows Linger</strong>, and <strong>Water Sleeps</strong>. Lastly, a D&amp;D campaign run by someone I don't know personally, recorded over on ENWorld as Sepulchrave II's Story Hour, Tales of Wyre.</p>
<p>The unifying element there, I think, is a focus on the struggles between driven (maybe even obsessed or mad) characters with big magic at their command. And, occasionally, how clever characters with tons of conviction but no sorcery to speak of are able to match themselves against these behemoths of magicians and give as good as they get.</p>
<p>So that's the types of characters I want to see and the stories I want to tell, and thus the starting point for a reward system. I need something that produces these characters, and drives their players to use them to tell these stories.</p>
<p>To encourage the creation of that kind of character, I think I'll use a traits system, kinda-sorta like BW's. I whipped up a list of about 100 traits, and divided them into positive, negative and neutral categories. Characters may start with 3-8 traits, and the number of positive traits cannot be more than 2 greater than the number of negative traits. (This isn't so much to enforce balance as to ensure that the negative traits will actually get picked with some frequency.)</p>
<p>Each trait is an aspect of personality or appearance, a possession, or an element of the character's social position that could draw them into conflict. By becoming a point of contention with other characters, by introducing complications, and so on.</p>
<p>Characters get check marks by their traits when use of the trait, or playing against the trait ...</p>
<ul>
<li>... introduces a complication to an existing conflict.</li>
<li>... initiates a new conflict.</li>
<li>... drives the plot in an unforeseen direction.</li>
<li>... helps them gain the upper hand in a conflict.</li>
<li>... sheds a different light on the character.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get a max of one check per trait per scene. Whenever you wish, you may trigger a trait. This erases all of the checks from the trait, but allows you to do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the trait's checks in dice to a roll. This may be done before or after the dice have hit the table. If you trigger the trait after rolling, you can only add in the bonus dice if you narrate a way in which the trait works to your advantage.</li>
<li>Test an attribute for advancement. Roll a dice pool equal to the checks in the triggered trait, at a penalty equal to the current dice in the attribute that you are testing against. If you score a success, the attribute increases by one die.</li>
<li>Initiate a flashback scene involving the triggered trait. The player may make a number of statements about the scene's setup equal to the checks in the triggered trait. Nothing that contradicts already established elements of the game may occur in a flashback scene.</li>
<li>Play out an 'elsewhere' scene involving a character connected to the triggered trait, but not the character who actually possesses the trait. The player may make a number of statements about the scene's setup equal to the checks in the triggered trait. For the duration of the scene, they take on the role of another character.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of a session, players may petition to have traits added to or subtracted from their character. If the GM agrees, then everyone at the table who <em>isn't</em> the GM or the player of the character in question votes yea or nay, or holds their peace. If the yeas outnumber the nays, then the trait is added or removed.</p>
<p>Seem kosher?</p>

                            Some /do/ have rules effects, but most are slight. Like, +/- 1 point of Toughness. The real reason is so that people will actually take negative traits. For instance, you've got a few like Addiction, Deaf, Hubris, Illiterate, Mad, Phobia, Ugly, and so on, that players whose top priority is in building an effective character won't pick. However, if you want the Estate, Familiar, Sorcery, and Spell Book traits, then you need at least two negatives.<br/>

                            One further: what happens if you take out those individual effects, and just let them all process through the system you describe above?  If every descriptor, good or bad, is a potential boon if played correctly, what do you get?<br/>
<br/>
For reference, I'm pushing this question because I do something similar in my own design.  I call them Thematic Batteries.  I'm finding that lots of stuff that would be "bad" can be turned into "good characterization" with just a touch of reinforcement system.                        </div>

<p>If I took out the effects of positive and negative traits... well, I don't really see it working. As I envision it, the trait mechanic is also what determines whether or not you're a sorcerer, have magical artifacts, are a landed noble with a castle, heaps of gold, and a hundred knights at your retainer, and so forth. If traits didn't serve that function, then I'd either have to create another mechanic for it, or just not address the issue in the rules. I'm not fond of either of those options. And even bad traits, when played correctly, <em>are</em> a potential boon. They're just not a double-boon, and have some consequences and ramifications.</p>
<p>Plus, as it is, I don't actually see a <em>downside</em> of grouping the traits into +/=/- categories. In fact, it allows me to make a bit of a statement, in some cases. For instance, I put the 'Liar' trait in the negative category, but not 'Nightmares' or 'Hypocrite' or 'Bastard.' Do you have an angle on this that I'm not getting?</p>

                            Ah, so these traits are also capacity as well as effectiveness.  That makes sense.  (FLFS, by contrast, is all about naval officers -- not much differentiation of capacity between them).                        </div>

<p>Anyway, I was just struck by this little idea while reading over Shreyas' graphical character sheet thread.</p>
<p>So: A good third or quarter of everyone's character sheet is taken up by a map. Standard fantasy fare, with forests and rivers and mountains and stuff, but no names or labels or cities or political boundaries or anything.</p>
<p>Oh! Or, instead of having little maps on the character sheets, you start with a big map for the whole group. As a pre-game thing. Like I said, just geography... before you even get to chargen, you've got this map sitting in the middle of the table. The GM lays out a few basic guidelines ("Let's stay away from the non-humans for now, and any concrete evidence of the existence or non-existence of divine beings"), and then you just go around the table, with everybody adding saying something about the map (or going into further detail about something that someone else said about the map) on their turn. Anyone can call BS at any time, and, if at least half the table doesn't like the whatever, then the whatever ain't true.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Alfred: This region (points to a southern archipelago) is The Aquamarine, a confederation of coastal and island city states.</p>
<p>Benjamin: At the mouth of this river there's a city (draws a little dot), Arjun, that's the most powerful in the Aquamarine. (writes in the name).</p>
<p>Calvin: Because it's ruled by the sorcerer-prince Camkamodes III, and is at the mouth of the Arja river. (writes in the name)</p>
<p>Dan: Over here (gestures to another southern region, an expanse of land devoid of rivers on the western edge of the map) is the oasis city of Futh. (draws a dot and writes a name)</p>
<p>Alfred: It's a small town in--</p>
<p>Dan: Bullshit! I imagined it as a big city! Any backup? (Ben and Cal support him)</p>
<p>Alfred: Okay, it's a major trading center in the desert empire of Eruth.</p>
<p>... and so on and so forth. I guess the game would come with a few maps drawn up in Illustrator or scanned in, and a bit of advice about making more.</p>
<p>Cool? Dopey?</p>

                            I'll support any game where 'bullshit' is a part of the game rules, until it fails to be fun, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Jeph: How about this: You have your overland map with nothing other than geographical features. This will allow for players to use almost any map they can find on the internet, or allow for easy distribution and reuse of maps (no two games are quite the same!)<br/>
<br/>
Then allow players to purchase icons (purchase being a mechanic), or just have a pile of them in the center. As the adventure goes along, someone is going to have an idea of what to do next. They apply the icon and with negotiation define it with the group. The key point is, they get to 'own' that part, be the GM, or whatever. Maybe final narration rights in that place? So everyone brings an adventure to the table prepared to be like, Damn, I want the Kingdom of the Three Rivers!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if that made sense or even helps, but I'm behind ya Jeph.                        </div>

                            Mark: The idea of having little icons on slips of paper or cardboard or whatever to play around with while building the map is awesome and novel. So is the concept of players 'owning' part of the map and GMing the game when it moves in that direction, and someone should totally make a game based around it--but it doesn't really fit with what I had in mind for this project; I'm sticking (mostly) to the traditional GM/Player divide on this one.<br/>
<br/>
Joshua: That's a really fucking good question. I've got a couple answers, but none of them are great.<br/>
<br/>
a) It takes a long time to draw a good map. Drawing every feature as you go would hella slow down the pregame. Drawing everything roughshod during the map creation would either result in a fugly map, or put a big time onus on the GM between games as they "pretty it up."<br/>
<br/>
b) Not everyone can draw. A game group with 0 artistic talent would = screwed.<br/>
<br/>
c) I once performed an experiment where we started with a totally blank slate, except for the idea that "it'll be a fantasy game." We tried to make the rules and map up as we went. It bombed. So badly that some of the guys have literally blocked it from their memories. Like, I have these two friends who met for the first time at that game, and, later, when they met again, they didn't remember each other. So I'm a bit averse to things reminiscent of that incident.<br/>
<br/>
d) Creativity thrives when you set a few boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
But still, like I said, good fucking question. Solution, maybe?: Have three options. Either use a pre-generated map that comes with the game, have someone draw up a bare-bones map before you start the pre-game, or actually make the entire map during the game play process.<br/>
<br/>
That's kinda avoid-the-problem-y, though. Inelegant.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like something slicker, if anyone has suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Incorporating cool little counters somehow?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, a last random thought: FoA has a big piece of posterboard, why can't I? Map creation goes like this: First, google up a map of the Earth, timeshifted back or forward a few tens of millions of years or so. Select a portion that grabs you, scale it up or down, re-orient it, and lightly, in pencil, transfer it two your poster board. Then you've got a bunch of counters, with cities, clumps of mountains and forest and swamp, and so forth. Go around the table. On your turn, you can either erase an island, draw in an island, redraw a bit of coastline, draw a bit of river, place a counter, name a placed counter or group of counters or river or island, or say a fact about a named counter or river or island.                        </div>

Most games require specific skills.  F'rex:<br/>
<br/>
-almost all sports and sport-like games<br/>
-agility games like Jungle Speed and Jenga<br/>
-logic puzzle games like Ingenious<br/>
-bluffing games like Poker<br/>

Now, I suck at bluffing, which means, I tend not to like playing poker.  But that doesn't mean I think Texas Hold'em is badly designed.<br/>

If it's a campaign, what you can do is make the digital map a part of the game and have the counters also be accessible in jpg or png format and after each session the digital map (maybe it's gridded and locks things down) can have the counters added to it?                        </div>

                            Hey Jeph:<br/><br/><code>d) Creativity thrives when you set a few boundaries.</code><br/><br/>I agree.  This is the main reason why i'm on your side with "stick with the map".  I mean, within the bounds of that there's tons of freedom ("The Ocean is actually AIR, because the continent is floating in the air!"  "The Mountains are actually impassible because we're in a VR sim and those places are all uncoded and TRON-looking", "we all live in the ocean, and the land is filled with poisonous air-magic!" etc), and it really gets the mind-juices flowing.  You just have to be careful to get someone to craft a map that's<br/><br/>1) Not too distinct or specifc, but does feature various common terrains and the like.<br/><br/>2) Maybe features strange marks here and there (A dot here, a Crown there, an Hourglass over there, a Zig-zag line other there, etc), which can turn out to be towns, Gods, giant mecha, or nothing, depending on what the players decide.<br/><br/>I really like where you're going here, and think it would be interesting to play.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
