This was the first time for all of us besides Malcolm, and we played it GM-less.  Conflicts were flying around like bullets at the OK and I tried to take notes but probably missed a few of the conflicts not involving Eugena (my character).  <br/><br/>After a little discussion, we decided to set it in a cinematic version of the Old West in a tiny little town called 'Loveless Gulch'.  We had:<br/><br/>Miriam Birch, who spent most of her time with horses and was a better shot then the men.<br/>Eugena O'Flannery, who was married to the preacher and spit tobacco when he wasn't around.<br/>Texas Lil, a jaded romantic madam who had an enormous library of books and couldn't read.<br/>Veronica, a polygamist songstress who was on the run from the law.<br/>Louise, the demure schoolmarm who was completely tone-deaf.<br/><br/>We needed a kicker to start the game off, so we decided that a murderer was going to be hanged that day, which gave the ladies (and I use that term loosely) a chance to congregate in the saloon half-owned by Texas Lil while the men-folk finished up the scaffolding outside.<br/><br/>Evidently Lil's saloon partner had been killed and Miriam's pa was on the noose.  But Miriam didn't seem too put up about it, Veronica was clearly hiding from something, and Eugena was smitten with the deputy lawman who showed up in town to preside over the hangin'.  When Eugena opened one button too many on her dress to dazzle the deputy, Veronica stepped in and played a sweet song on her guitar to impress the silver star.  But Eugena took her flirting just far enough, and when the deputy opened his arms to embrace her, he swung back and smacked Veronica's guitar...breaking a string and knocking the poor songstress to the floor.  While this potential adultery was a-going on, Lil got suspicious and tried to get the truth out of Miriam, who played it smart and got away from the subject.  Louise went over to talk to the bruised Veronica and told her she knew what was up with Miriam.  And turns out that Veronica's former husband had done some bad things, but everyone knew she was lying in her teeth about something.  Still following?<br/><br/>Before we went to the hanging scene, everyone wanted a flashback scene to the funeral of Willie Makit (Lil saloon partner) a few days earlier. The preacher was giving his sermon about the evils in the town and how we need to repent and forgive, while the ladies gave furtive glances at their town sisters.  Eugena noted with horror that her preacher husband was gesturing with *her* gilt-edged bible, which was actually hollowed out so she could keep her makeup case at the ready.  She tried to get it back from him, and Veronica tried to intercede so the evil bible would be unveiled to all.  But Veronica slipped and fell into the open grave while Eugena did a quick swap and got her "holy book" back.<br/><br/>Flashforward back to normal time and the ladies are walking outside to watch the hanging.  The preacher is saying his solemn words up on the scaffolding with the deputy and the unfortunate Pa with the noose around his neck.  Veronica just can't stop loving men, and she runs outside with a telegram from a high-priced lawyer back east to "Stop the hanging!"  She runs up the scaffolding and presents the deputy with the telegram, who announces it as legit and puts the execution off for the day.  Eugena runs out and yells, "Well if he didn't do it...who did?" And in the ensuing confusion, the ungraceful Veronica slips and falls off the scaffolding as the scene fades to black.<br/><br/>Next scene is at the "No One Got Hung" dance that night in the saloon.  Veronica and the man were playing a festive tune, and she is singing brightly about the brave deputy.  Eugena tries to stop her but fails this time, and Veronica falls off the stage and straight into the arms of the young lawman.  Louise takes the ill-chosen opportunity to hop up on stage and sing with the band.  She is tone-deaf and it's so bad the dogs run for cover while Eugena fumes.<br/><br/>The next day is Sunday, so all the folks are a-going to church.  The preacher is talking about fire &amp; brimstone and Veronica is flirting away with the deputy sitting next to her.  Eugena tries one last attempt to get the deputy back by putting an expensive ring in the collection tray where he can see it.  The scene fades with Veronica swinging alone on the treeswing outside while Eugena and the deputy share a scoop at the ice-cream social.  The preacher is inside going through the collection tray and is taken aback to recognize the pricey ring in there.<br/><br/>It was getting late, so we decided to have one last scene in the saloon at night during a bad storm.  Thunder shook the building and the shutters smacked loudly from the wind.  By this time it had come out that Miriam had actually shot Texas Lil's partner, partially because she knew Lil would get full ownership of the saloon but mostly to get back at her good-for-nothin' father.  Veronica and Eugena were still making tongues wag with their incessant lawman-chasing.  But when the townsfolk found out that Louise the schoolmarm owned a pair of black lace undies...well that just couldn't stand.  They forgot all about the murder and adultery and threatened to pull their kids out of the schoolhouse.  That is, until they realized that Louise was a certified genius and everyone else was just too darned stupid to teach their kids anything.<br/><br/>It was the worst of times.  But in the end, they were all still Best Friends.<br/><br/>==<br/><br/>The rules to the game were very clear and easy to follow.  I liked the stat creation (I hate xx because she is smarter/prettier/etc. than me) and really like the currency trading to "push" stats in a scene.  But most importantly, the rules didn't get in the way of telling a great story.  I think the best rule that Malcolm noted was that "conflicts can be with another person or object or situation, but they *must* be opposed by someone at the table or they aren't a conflict".  This led to the "spiderweb of petty hatreds" that we saw at the table.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91749/#Comment_91749" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T11:24:49+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Louise last night.

I loved that anyone could throw some content in to see if it stuck.  Veronica constantly falling became a bit of an in-joke and everyone joined in, but in the end she fell into the arms of the deputy and it just made *sense*.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Albert A</cite>One thing that felt a bit off was the complete lack of any pacing mechanics or endgame condition.

But while a meta-structure would have really helped, we got around it by pacing the scenes ourselves and decided both "when" the last scene would be and the fact that it should be a humdinger that tied everything together.<br/>Perhaps just some guidelines/suggestions in the rules (which I have not fully read) about how to pace the game would be helpful to a lot of people.  I know a lot of games use examples of play, but they are usually around scene creation and conflict resolution.  A sample "this is an example 7-scene game to see how the scenes progressed and how the story was resolved" would go a long way I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91765/#Comment_91765" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T11:39:31+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:39AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 1:19PM by komradebob.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Texas Lil:<i>I do decla' Ah am still shocked...

However, it also meant that if anyone wanted to call an "I figure out the truth" conflict (which did eventually happen), they could!

EndGame should have some copies on the shelves so please flick through a copy there. In the book I talk of setting some sort of end condition for the game. I think you might base a story around some particular piece of Nonsense, or a few inter-related pieces of Nonsense, and say "OK, when we resolve these then we'll end the game" or you can say "when we reach the hanging at noon tomorrow, that's it".<br/><br/>If you want to be mechanical about it then you can all take a turn framing a scene and wrap up when everyone has had a scene. I'm not sure if this would help the pacing or hinder it though.<br/><br/>Mostly I've found that the fiction tells me when we want to end the story, if that makes sense?<br/><br/>I'm all for everyone sharing their Nonsense. We're all Best Friends, right? We know most everything about each other.<br/><br/>Oh, if you both had Pretty 0 then you're tied.

Yes, there were time issues, but I think that only served to focus us on a story which had a definite end. It didn't feel too rushed in the final phases and the denoument was enjoyable and appropriate.<br/><br/>The suggestion of everyone framing X number of scenes then the game ends seems quite viable and would give an interesting vibe to the game. I'm not sure if I would make it "everyone frames X scenes and then there is a communally decided final scene" or not. The responsibility on one person for a powerful/effective final scene might be a bit much for some. I guess that individual groups and players would have their own preferences for this.<br/><br/>Finally, getting to play with Chris, Robert, Nancy and Albert was a great laugh and tremendously enjoyable.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99518/#Comment_99518" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T11:59:29+00:00" title="September 27, 2007 11:59AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I feel that an all "1"s character can be kind of interesting, but there is that feeling of a let down when you get it, isn't there?

But then again, this has only happened to me about once in all the BF games I've taken part in. I think there is an ordinary, human desire to want to be 'special' in some way. You want to be the cool kid, the smart kid, etc (substitute 'kid' for 'superhero', 'adventurer' or whatever). When you get something like that in any game (like all 9s rolling up a character inred box D&amp;D!), it does force you to actually create something cool about your character beyond what is shown by the results. Which in and of itself is, I think, the solution that already exists.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99991/#Comment_99991" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-30T04:19:20+00:00" title="September 30, 2007  4:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2007 4:19AM by Gregor Hutton.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chris<br/><br/>I wouldn't let anyone adjust their scores.<br/><br/>I guess if someone got all 1s then, to me, that's interesting and they have to play with it.

I actually had assumed that there would be very little reference to sf/horror/fantasy/etc and that a more <i>Heathers</i> sort of vibe would run through it, with maybe a sidenote on the more usual rpg subjects.<br/><br/>I guess I'm just weirded out a bit at how often games that don't seem to inherently tie into the usual rpg genre fiction end up using genre fiction examples (PTA and Universalis hit me that way, too).<br/><br/>I honestly can't say whether it is good or bad. There are just too many factors for me to consider, most of them having to do with the target audience that exists versus the often posited audience that might exist but no one has proven.<br/><br/>Either way, there's a bunch I like about this game. I might have mentioned that I went into this actual play with a lot of doubts about whether I'd enjoy the game, and have since ended up buying it, so...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100310/#Comment_100310" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T15:30:14+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  3:30PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Robert<br/><br/>My perception has been that some folks just "hook" on to one way to see the game. "Mean Girls" seems the most common, though I must confess to never having seen the film.<br/><br/>I feel that non-gamers find the references to all sorts of tales, both mundane and fantastical, as trivial. It is after all, to them, a game about stories. <br/><br/>The <a href="http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/promo/gencon_demo_2007.pdf" rel="nofollow">demo</a> I ran at GenCon has three possibilities I outlined for play. I tended to find an almost even split between the three options there: schoolgirls, secret agents and fantasy adventurers, with slightly more for the schoolgirls one (perhaps the "safest" choice?).<br/><br/>Though, when I play it with friends I tend to see what we's all like to do at the time.  I mean, I really enjoyed a game of "Rome" that we played with it. I GMed the game and all the players took on the role of Senator's or General's wives, the real movers and shakers in the Imperium.<br/><br/>I also had a really strong scene at GenCon with Diana Koppang in a one-on-one game. We were late-teen/early-twenties theatre actors. It was just a very human game about people -- not a pastiche or openly zany, humourous, or otherworldly in any way at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100319/#Comment_100319" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T16:40:21+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  4:40PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>My perception has been that some folks just "hook" on to one way to see the game.
