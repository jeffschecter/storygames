(Screw it, let's stir the pot.)<br/><br/>Bangs ask you to make a statement.  They present you with a situation that is inherently unstable, and they ask you how you see it and what that leads you to do.  From a certain point of view, this is perfect -- it asks for your interpretation, your perspective, on a thing that doesn't have inherent meaning until you construct it through your actions.  They're fun, it's entertaining to watch how people deal with them, and they don't force anyone down a certain path.<br/><br/>From another point of view, that's an awful situation to be in.  It's ambiguous, there's no clear right choice.  Much of the time, they put your principles in conflict with each other.  These situations are for people who don't know what they stand for, who want to "explore issues."  You ought to just be able to do the correct thing and get it over with, move the story forward.<br/><br/>From a third point of view, bangs are still awful.  They present you with a challenge that has no clear goal, that has no defined end point, that doesn't specify what resources you have available, and gives you little to no way to figure out what trade-offs you can make to resolve it.  And even worse, sometimes they go so far as to violate the notion that the imagined universe operates according to observable principles, because creating bangs puts a higher priority on "interesting story" than on "how the world works"!<br/><br/>I don't believe any of those view points is <i>right</i>, but they're all <i>valid</i>.  And they are, nearly verbatim, the Radical, Manager, and Strategist from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=167551" rel="nofollow">over here</a> (for the tl;dr crowd, scroll down to the table.)  They're also the views I hear expressed the most, and the views I most often see in conflict, here and elsewhere.  <br/><br/>I've seen it enough times now I can almost predict what those viewpoints would say about each other.   And for that matter, what each of them will say about the idea of other viewpoints being valid...<br/><br/>(A hint: everyone is wrong, if you listen to everyone else.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170000/#Comment_170000" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T22:43:07+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 10:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure why a Bang necessarily omits a clear goal, or an understanding of current resources.

Otherwise, it wouldn't be an evocative choice, right?  If one option is clearly the best, then it doesn't have the sort of open-ended possibilities that I've come to associate with Bangs.  Of course, Bangs can happen in the context of a goal.  "I want to achieve this, but now in order to do that, I've got to choose between A and B (and C and...)"  But Bangs themselves don't seem to work well if they're goal driven.  "Crap, now that this Bang happened, I have to achieve XYZ."  It's not open-ended in the same way; it really isn't much of a Bang at all, because there's no evocative choice.  Its all been spelled out -- it's more like GM fiat, actually.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Johnson</cite>Also, I would say that Bangs still work for characters that profess to understand their priorities, because forcing a rigid character to keep stiff under increasingly greater pressure is good grist for storytelling. Again, perhaps I'm not understanding your assertion.</blockquote>\nIt works great for characters that profess to understand their priorities, I agree.  But in order for that situation to be enjoyable, you've got a certain mindset operating in the player behind the character.  And someone operating from a Manager mode when a Bang happens will rarely enjoy it, because they're operating in a right/wrong, black/white mode of thought, and the bang will either force them to a) switch modes -- which they won't be happy about if they were enjoying Manager mode, or b) continue on with Manager thinking -- which they won't be happy about, since bangs aren't interesting or evocative when there's a clear right choice (and in Manager mode, there almost always is.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Johnson</cite>If what you are saying is that sometimes a player doesn't want to roleplay a Sophie's Choice scenario, I would say yes, that's correct, and you have found a pleasantly provocative way of saying so.</blockquote>\nI am saying that, and I'm saying more than that.  I'm saying "Sometimes a player doesn't want to roleplay a Sophie's Choice scenario, and I can make pretty good guesses which players will feel that way, and I can make a pretty good guess what their complaints will be, and I can make pretty good guesses as to what they do want instead."

I used Bangs, even before it had a name. BUT, I did not use them all the time, bang, bang bang. Because, a kind of fatigue does set in. You HAVE to mix it up, sometimes you decide between right and wrong, between right and right and between wrong and wrong. With few exceptions, if you don't mix it up, the game is ruined, no?<br/>\n  As far as which "kinds" of players like which kind of scenario, I think that is an over-simplification. It is probably more likely that these different player types prefer different mixes of the three types of choices (right/right, right/wrong, wrong/wrong). But, my guess is there isn't a roleplaying gamer out there that doesn't like to mix it up a little, you know?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170063/#Comment_170063" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T07:57:05+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  7:57AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good lord, folks.<br/><br/>A bang is something introduced into a scene that makes players make meaningful choices.<br/><br/>"A demon crashes through the skylight, hungry for blood."<br/><br/>"Your dead mother calls your cell phone and asks why you haven't visited her grave lately."<br/><br/>"You open the door to the throne-room and the biggest, baddest-ass orc you have ever seen, He Who Rules with Spell and Sword, is choking your elven brother while laughing..."<br/><br/>There are other fucking techniques in bang-driven play.  Sorcerer, Burning Wheel, PTA and other games about tough choices are not bang after bang after bang after bang.  If we want to stick to terms coined by Ron Edwards in the Sorcerer line, there are bobs (rests), weaves (bringing shit together) and crosses (weave's brother).<br/><br/>Some games might be all bangs all of the time, hitting a single guitar string with a hammer but yes, of course that would get old and get old fast.  Most of the games I play in this style have plenty of those wonderful quiet moments.  Those moments, where the samurai sit in the bath-house and talk about the oni they just faced, where the gunslingers chew tobacco and spit into a tin pan while waiting for high noon, where the orc sit in front a fire in their keep to discuss how to strengthen their growing empire, are critically important.  Without those quiet moments, the screaming moments of hammer hitting the guitar don't mean shit.<br/><br/>I think bangs get mentioned a whole lot in online communication because they are fun to talk about and are easy to communicate:<br/><br/>"Then the demon the sorcerer had summoned earlier and lost control of crashed through the skylight!"<br/><br/>Etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170066/#Comment_170066" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T08:02:38+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  8:02AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2008 8:04AM by Max Higley.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Judd (and others, actually), you're kinda off-topic there.

Just as a disclaimer, understand that I'm not expressing my own preferences here, so you're really in no danger of offending me regardless of how you feel about any of these approaches.<br/><br/>"Do what was planned so we can move on" is often exactly the sentiment expressed by someone thinking in Manager mode.  The deal is though, that particular phrase has completely different connotations depending on which mode you're thinking about it in.  From a Manager standpoint, moving along the planned track is what you're supposed to do, it's the <i>correct</i> approach.  This, of course, is maddening to someone coming from a Radical standpoint, since it puts the GM's vision on a categorically separate plane from everyone else's -- it removes opportunities to contribute, to share your viewpoint, to make statements, to interpret, to relate as equals.  And it's maddening to someone coming from a Strategist viewpoint, because if there's right way to do it, there's no fun in searching for the best available solution.  It removes the opportunity to be a creative problem solver, to balance important concerns, and so forth.  But to the Manager, it's just the way things are done:  You are presented with choices, there are right choices and wrong choices, and you choose. Then you are either rewarded or punished.  Nothing in that is conflicting with a preplanned story, which is why people with strong Manager mode preferences often express a fondness for what others might call "linear scenarios."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite>From a third point of view, bangs are still awful.

And even worse, sometimes they go so far as to violate the notion that the imagined universe operates according to observable principles, because creating bangs puts a higher priority on "interesting story" than on "how the world works"!</blockquote>\nExamples?  I am not quite grokking how a bang can violate "how the world works."<br/>A frequent complaint is that something or other, bang or otherwise, isn't plausible.  You may recognize this complaint if you've played with people who are into heavy Simulation.<br/><br/>The viewpoint expressed in the above quote, the Strategist mode, wants things to operate on the basis of universal, observable principles of how the imagined world works.  The problem with bangs, from that viewpoint, is that they're motivated not by the laws of the imagined universe, but by the dictates of creating an interesting game.  In other words, when people thinking in Strategist mode complain about bangs, they mean that, from their point of view, the situation was not a natural result of what came before it, but instead imposed on the fiction from outside.  And that's a problem, because if the world doesn't have observable principles of how it works, then the opportunity to strategize goes out the window.  If you can't rely on the world operating predictably, then any strategy you come up with, any solution you devise, can always be invalidated whenever the GM feels like it.  That removes the opportunity for a Strategist to have the kind of fun they want.<br/><br/>A real example from my group: Someone with a strong Strategist preference is playing a character who is married and has children.  The character comes home from a long trip, and, with no warning, discovers that his wife has become addicted to opium in his absence.  From a pro-bang point of view, we're cool -- something has happened that forces evocative choices, and depending on how the character reacts, a ton of interesting things can happen.  There are all kinds of interesting dynamics here, and lots of issues to make statements on.  This is juicy one.<br/><br/>From the Strategist's point of view, he just got fucked over big time.  Since there were no clues that it was coming, there was nothing he could do to prevent it.  And since it went completely counter to the sort of person he understood his wife to be, it didn't seem plausible -- no principles of the imagined universe he was aware of indicated that this sort of thing might happen.  And even worse, there was no way to strategize about what to do now, since the situation itself didn't prevent any resources to work with and it was single-faceted.<br/><br/>The natural Radical counter-argument, and the one we actually did see in real life, is that the player is free to make these things up.  "If you need resources, make some up, and we'll happily run with that.  You can approach it however you want.  We're excited to see how your character's perspective plays out, and what sort of statement you make here.  You're empowered to do these things."  It didn't go over well, for reasons that should be obvious by now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170086/#Comment_170086" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T09:02:16+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  9:02AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max,<br/><br/>Those sound like weak-ass bangs, man.

Like, at all.  I'm pointing out why, from certain points of view, they don't seem appealing.  That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with them.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are better examples of bangs, but that's beside the point -- this particular example is a <i>great</i> example of a situation where someone who didn't want to play with bangs was forced to play with them.  The reason the bangs weren't more strongly based on the character sheet and pre-game prep is because the player hadn't prepped his character with the notion that it would be used to create bangs at all!  So the GM was forced to create weak bangs, because the foundation for them wasn't laid (the players weren't interested and had no reason to do so.)  Inevitably, this caused a conflict, which you correctly point out could be eliminated by talking about this stuff before the game.  And, in later games, it was.  No big deal, social contract amended, everything turns out fine.<br/><br/>But this same conflict, in grander scale, still pops up in every internet conversation about bangs, narrativism, pre-game planning...I'm pointing out that none of these viewpoints is <i>wrong</i>.  From each viewpoint, their own preferences make perfect sense, and everyone else seems insane.  The trick is to be able to take someone else's perspective and play it out until you see why they're objecting to the things they're objecting to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170089/#Comment_170089" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T09:13:21+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  9:13AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Do you like mystery novels?

He's saying that the styles, philosophies, perspectives, or types that he's identified (Radical, Manager, etc) lead different gamers to understand "the bang" as a concept in different ways. This actually has very little to do with what a bang "actually is," since what it is and how it works are intertwined with what you understand it to be. Heavy epistemological issues coming to the fore, here, and the idea that I think Max is advancing is not "hey Bangs suck" but "you'll have a better chance talking to someone who thinks differently about this if you understand the nature of the (intellectual, cognitive) difference."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170092/#Comment_170092" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T09:23:05+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  9:23AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max and Bill,<br/><br/>Thanks, I'm working on not digging trenches and standing by a flag that doesn't exist as if it means something.<br/><br/>I am all for figuring out if someone's at the wrong table and getting them lickity split to the right one before it damages the game or more importantly the friendships around the table.<br/><br/>Judd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170093/#Comment_170093" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T09:29:06+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  9:29AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "I find my wife addicted" bang may have particular issues with it apart from "banginess" in that the Player may feel "I have just seen something change I would have liked to have an opportunity to prevent - where was my opportunity to see this coming, hear something wrong in her voice when I spoke to her on the phone a month ago - what is this GM Fiat about something so integral to my character?"<br/><br/>That would be my reaction as Player to this situation.  If we're playing a game where we have relationships matter, a relationship that close - screwing with that without doing it "through the system", nu-uh.  That is "on my sheet stuff", you might as well tell me my stats just changed (okay, maybe I've been playing too many of Vincent's games where relationships are on sheets).<br/><br/>The example used long ago of the bang of seeing the house of the guy you don't like on fire and "what do you do" is one that is more exploratory less coercive.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean I'm against bangs that test two priorities against each other, but in ways that are open to how resolved and that don't require completely negating one.

To do it successfully, it helps to see from their perspective, right? Or, well, your own when you're playing those games.<br/><br/>I mean, some folks do approach RPGs and S-Gs very similarly to the way they approach BattleLore, for example. The Bang thing? Not gonna work well for them, if that's how they're coming at stuff.<br/><br/><br/>Thing is, I don't think, IIUC, that Max's categories are intended to be the way a single person plays something all the time. It might be what they prefer right now. It might be what they're used to, or what they've always experienced. But to even be able to find that out, you need to be able to talk to them in their "language".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170103/#Comment_170103" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T10:03:33+00:00" title="September 19, 2008 10:03AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like what Max tried to do in this thread and the questions he explores.

I suppose the level of animosity is a combination of people not reading the premises of the discussion and the long years of fight for many members here to explain why their way of having fun is valid.<br/><br/>I come from a breed of gamers where notions like bangs had never been formulated. So I'm still struggling with this kind of ideas. Plus I'm not always convinced those ideas are applicable, especially since my current group has close to zero experience out of the D&amp;D sphere. So those considerations about how to make narrative mechanics palatable matter a lot to me. I think it's a critical point in order to expand the diversity of game play in the game community as a whole (not just story gamers).<br/><br/>Keep up the brainstorming, it's great stuff !                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170105/#Comment_170105" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T10:14:17+00:00" title="September 19, 2008 10:14AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I like Bangs in that they are about "lets see character develop" not just lets play a wargame.<br/><br/>I like Bangs as a Player in that I don't like character development to be my map in head simply being laid out in play.<br/><br/>I'm fine to find out if love or honour mean more to the PC I'm playing and have fun setting up characters with GM's running "boring tactical crap" so that the GM would unknowingly tip my PC one way or other and I wouldn't know which till it happened.

Come to think of it, that shit pisses me off, too.  There's a certain air of "I'm fucking with you just for the sake of fucking with you" around that which I don't like.<br/><br/>Tough choices are fine, as long as those aren't the only choices you ever get.  Non-obvious choices are fine, again, as long as they're not the only choices around.  Random accidents, unforeseen complications?  All fine.  But if I get a whiff of "well, the game seems to be slowing down, so I'm just going to dump this random problem on you" off of a situation, it bothers me.  It feels like a cheap trick, and in the kinds of games I like, it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Drop an anvil on my character's head when he's in an anvil factory and I'm fine -- drop that same anvil when he's standing in an open field on a cloudless day surrounded by fluffy white bunnies, and I'm going to call bullshit on you.<br/><br/>So I guess that puts me in the "I hate certain types of bangs, but not others" camp.

If there are tricks or methods about how to do that, I'd be very happy to learn them<br/><br/>Well, the obvious answer (and not so much useful, for now, but it's a start) is making sure that the initial situation (and characters, and setting) is prone to producing bangs. In a "natural" way, without having to force-fed them to the players.<br/><br/>The usual way I have seen this done is using character creation. Many games have "flags" on the character sheet that are gold for a GM searching for something that already exist in the game that is problematic for the character.  Why this is the usual way? I suspect it's because, this way, you get to have the players do most of the work, and you are more sure that they will find the bangs interesting. The drawback is that, if you have players who don't like this amount of "protagonism" for their character (don' want the bangs to revolve around them), and/or see any flag on the character sheet as a "weakness" and fill it with inanities that they don't really consider interesting, this methot can fall flat.<br/><br/>Luckily, there is an alternative, even if it's less used because it's more work for the GM: to get a bang-bringing situation, you can complicate the characters, yes... but you can instead complicate the setting!<br/><br/>You can have the most vanilla, undetailed, "bland" and bang-free character in the world, but if you put them in complicated world, they WILL have to make a choice.  Two leaders, fighting for the domination of the clan, both with good reasons: who will the characters follow? They will follow one? Both? No-one? (many players will not recognize these as "bangs" because there is this idea that bangs are character-centric. But it's not so).<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is build on this principle (as is the game that inspired it, Trollbabe).  Shadows of Yesterday is less explicit, but work best like this, too.  Some setting, like Glorantha, are rife with bangs-creating situations.<br/><br/>Some links.

Why? Because they are used to them. They are in use, in some form, at least from the first dungeon where the characters could join a faction against the other. They are really not a "new hippy emo story gamers thing". And other people could like some other combinations of techniques, too.<br/><br/>I don't really feel the need to tell people "you can avoid using any form of bangs if you want".

I'm not merely talking about crying into your beer when you wanna kill monsters and take their stuff; maybe there's an ideological difference in play expectation underlying (and perhaps undermining) different styles of play, which is far more important.<br/><br/>My playgroup consists of (by design) essentially one of each of Max's archetypes, and everyone's having a great time in a weirdass game. I think it's because we discussed the goals of play philosophically during our first session, goals both as individuals and as a team. Everyone gets their slice of the decision-making pie, and the combination of tactical warfare, collaborative storytelling, and overall bang-oriented wrench-throwing seems enjoyable to everyone, if only because they know <i>their</i> neat shit's just around the bend.<br/><br/>My $.02.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170198/#Comment_170198" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T15:16:00+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  3:16PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weird. <br/><br/>I don't see the conflicts that Max puts forth. After reading, I think it's because I may see bangs differently than he does. It may be that I see bangs differently than Ron Edwards, who coined the term, does too. <br/><br/>This is what I think of when I hear people talk about bangs. A bang is an event that happens that forces one or more people to make a choice, and to have things happen as a result of their choice. It doesn't have to be story-driven. Bangs, from my viewpoint, happen in real life. <br/><br/>A grenade is tossed into your tent. You can choose one of many courses of action. None of them are dictated by the grenade being tossed. You can stand there and stare. You can run. You can throw yourself on the grenade. You can try to grab it and throw it away from you. You can grab a buddy and get him to cover. You can throw a buddy on the grenade. <br/><br/>This is a simplistic example, but I thought of 3 of those choices as I was writing them, and I'm pretty sure I could think of at least a couple more. Now, I could tell you which ones are the right ones and which are the wrong ones, based on my values. Your values may be different, and so your perception of which ones are right and wrong will differ. <br/><br/>Here's the important part: No matter what choice you make, something happens as a result of that choice. You get blown up, you maybe escape, you die saving everyone, you toss the grenade out of the tent and it blows up outside, you save your buddy. Your buddy dies while you live. <br/><br/>The manager might have some problem with the open-endedness, but unless he perceives that there is absolutely no plan (see "You led us by the nose too much") then he'll react as he deems proper and see "reward" or "punishment" as appropriate. The radical will like the open-endedness. He can react however he likes, and it has the potential to be cool. The strategist has many built in tactical options. Depending on the circumstances, (the tent is in the Ozarks on a camping trip, or it's in the middle of a military camp) he might have problems with the event not "fitting", but that has nothing to do with the fact that it's a bang, it has to do with the manipulation of the fiction. So long as it's thematically and setting appropriate, score.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170202/#Comment_170202" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T15:34:45+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  3:34PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Max thought some comments I whispered might be worth exposing to the world. (Max, I've edited slightly because I was responding to your first post, which is now way the heck upthread.)</i><br/><br/>The Holist (from Max's chart) is also, IMO, somewhat at odds with "interesting story", based on a quick look.<br/><br/>Not completely sure I buy the chart, though. I mean, all these divisions (GNS, etc.) create a strong temptation, just like zodiacal signs, to glom onto one of them for arbitrary reasons and then, perhaps out of some narcissistic urge, to focus on the traits that seem "right" in that category while ignoring the others' "rightness", as well as glossing over discrepancies. But I'm tempted to see myself as a Strategist/Holist.<br/><br/>This might help illustrate the fact that I can enjoy games where verisimilitude takes priority over control. E.g., I've had people complain about Empires of the Middle Ages and Republic of Rome, two board wargames of which I'm very fond, because it's too easy to be hosed by random events. While I like them because they emulate the fact that "shit happens".<br/><br/>Anyway, so you can test your hypotheses about how the viewpoints react to each other, I think the pro-bang viewpoint is touchy-feely and risks narrative incoherence. I've called it, at least in extreme and possibly clumsy applications, "gussied up Scruples". The second viewpoint is just boring. And the third, while it gets it right about "how the world works", is too anal about finding the perfect solution.<br/><br/><i>Now, added to the above...</i><br/><br/>I like open situations, unstable situations. I just don't see the method of Bangs as the way I want to arrive at them.<br/><br/>Also, to further critique the chart, and in the spirit of Max's meta analysis here and on the thread where the chart was posted, I'll suggest that missing the Holist element (mistaking it for the Manager or Strategist) is a typical Radical failing.\n<blockquote>I'd like to hear more about what "move the story forward," means. My ears hear, "Do what the DM planned for me to do so we can all move on," but I don't want to put thoughts in your head or words in your mouth.</blockquote>I'll offer a different interpretation to Judd's &amp; Max's, and far more sympathetic. What "move the story forward" can mean is "give me a chance to do what my character is made to do", or simply, "let me express my character". Incidentally, when I think about comedy-adventure, this seems much more central to the narrative than "moral complications". We already know that Superman's strong, the point of the comic is to show just how strong he is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170205/#Comment_170205" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T15:54:04+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  3:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarrod</cite>maybe there's an ideological difference in play expectation underlying (and perhaps undermining) different styles of play, which is far more important.</blockquote>\nThat's...um...the topic of this thread, yes. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>But if we are not all the same, we are not in two little boxes, too.

We saw that in Bret's thread.  It's not that they're making things up, it's that, as Bill White pointed above, what you think is there is highly dependent on how you look.  The Manager, the Strategist, the Radical, and so on each see a different thing when they look at a bang.  Some people have pointed out that my description of bangs doesn't sound like theirs -- that's precisely the point!  Because we have different underlying values, we tend to see the parts that either help or hinder our own agendas, and ignore the rest.  That, in large part, is why I think we end up talking about seven different things using the same word.<br/><br/>But your broader point here about constructing bangs that work across these types is an even better one, and a topic that definitely, definitely deserves its own thread.  I hope that the framework I laid out proves useful for that conversation -- helping people see the different underlying assumptions behind a conversation is, after all, what it's for.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite><br/>Also, to further critique the chart, and in the spirit of Max's meta analysis here and on the thread where the chart was posted, I'll suggest that missing the Holist element (mistaking it for the Manager or Strategist) is a typical Radical failing.</blockquote>\nI hesitate to call it a failing, since all of these modes see things through their own lens and each lens highlights some things and cloaks others in shadow.  However, not seeing the systemic perspective <i>is</i> one of the downsides of every other mode.  That doesn't make it particularly special though, because every mode largely hides the existence of the other modes.  I attribute this to the aforementioned effect of confirmation bias -- seeing the things you expect to see and the things that either confirm or threaten your view of the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170212/#Comment_170212" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T16:50:17+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  4:50PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite><br/>This is what I think of when I hear people talk about bangs.

This actually has very little to do with what a bang "actually is," since what it is and how it works are intertwined with what you understand it to be.</blockquote>\nThis here?

A "setting bang" can certainly be relevant, much like the grenade example.<br/><br/>Is tailored specifically to the character, followed by another, followed by another, followed by another...<br/><br/>That's where I personally can see problems beginning, especially if it begins to look like a constant screwing of their character.<br/><br/>I mean, how often does a string of bangs end up happy?

Bangs that challenge fundamental beliefs, bangs that strongly imply some sort of ideological compromise. Yeah, I know a proper bang doesn't have <i>any</i> sort of implication attached to it, but in practice (and as I've seen them applied) there's often a narrowish range of responses that both GM and player can immediately suss out. <br/><br/>Maybe the easiest bang is to introduce a crisis situation, and crises are rarely responded to in a proactive, positive way. It might be worth thinking a bit about non-crisis bangs, story moments where numerous <i>good</i> choices are on the table, opportunities to serve both expedience and ideology.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170220/#Comment_170220" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T17:09:18+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  5:09PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would be <i>very</i> interested in a split thread for "postive" bang makin' .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170240/#Comment_170240" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T20:13:32+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  8:13PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>The complaint given by one player in our group about bangs was close to Valvorik's post above (#20); it was really the "out of the blue" style of bang involving relationships/situations which her character by all rights ought to have had some input into beforehand that pissed her off.

Because we have different underlying values, we tend to see the parts that either help or hinder our own agendas, and ignore the rest.  That, in large part, is why I think we end up talking about seven different things using the same word.<br/></blockquote>\nMax, I know you keep saying that you don't want to talk about whether an example of a Bang is good or crappy. . .but I honestly don't know how else to engage this topic. 'Cause I see it as precisely the point: if we're to talk about differences in preferences/perspectives, then we've simply got to work toward accurately representing those perspectives. I know there's a danger of digging into entrenched positions, onetruewayism, and all that stuff, but on the other hand we seem to be talking past each other, and besides we're still ending up with a pretty polarized discussion (Moreno's "two boxes').<br/><br/>So lemme try n' explain my perspective. I'm seeing a lot of people saying they like/don't like this or that kind of play and attaching the word "Bang" to it, which is all fine and dandy. But every time someone tries to give a description (real or hypothetical) of Bang usage they didn't like. . .it doesn't look like it's any intrinsic quality of Bangs that's killing the fun, it looks like a whole other element is responsible. Basically, the thing introduced is a disconnect of some kind--from the established setting or situation, from the character concept, from the previous motives and behavior of NPCs, what have you.<br/><br/>In other words, it "came out of the blue." But here's the thing: coming out of the blue has <i>nothing</i> to do with bangs. You can have disjointed events that aren't Bangs, or well-integrated, right-feeling events that are Bangs. I mean, leave aside for a minute whether a disjointed Bang is "crappy." I'm not trying to have that how-to-improve-bangs conversation here. Just look at it from a communication standpoint. Attaching "out of the blue" to the concept of Bangs fails a basic "talking about the same thing" test. If we're trying to understand why somebody might like or dislike something, then this is a big deal. It's as if I was talking about liking a certain activity and, say, Elliot was like, "Man, count me out. Hitting your head over and over with a hammer just kills my fun." And I go, "What? That's not the thing I enjoy at <i>all</i>. Actually you hit <i>nails</i> with the hammer, and it's awesome!" But now the head-pounding activity has been accepted as "Hammering" play, and alluva sudden people are miffed 'cause I'm not trying to see Elliot's perspective and just defending my own activity.<br/><br/>That's what this discussion feels like to me. I mean, I guess you could hit your head with the hammer, and it would still technically be "hammering." But I don't think it's amiss to point out that a lot of people, myself included, do in fact hit <i>nails</i> with our hammer and would consider hitting one's head to be a failure at the hammering activity.<br/><br/>Now the universe isn't gonna implode if Elliot or whoever doesn't like Bangs. But I don't feel especially like it's been established that he doesn't like Bangs. I think it's been established that there are <i>some</i> ("head-hammering") Bangs he doesn't like, but it doesn't really speak to how he would enjoy Bangs of another type, because the objection os to something not intrinsic to Bangs. Hence, it doesn't really feel like we're reaching understanding.<br/><br/>So. . .I'm not sure where that leaves us in this discussion. I mean, sure, in the abstract, it's all fine to point out how our perspectives cause us to view through different lenses, be blind to other perspectives, and so forth--but you already made that point in your other thread. The real question now is, where dlo we go from here? Like I said, Elliot or whoever can like or not like whatever he wants. . .but if someone was playing in a game with <i>me</i>, and i wanted them to understand what this thing is and why I want it. . .well, "we all have different perspectives and priorities" would be a great start but a lousy endpoint.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170365/#Comment_170365" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-21T07:00:53+00:00" title="September 21, 2008  7:00AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2008 10:50AM by Max Higley.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>So lemme try n' explain my perspective.

It necessarily depends on and interrelates with the other aspects of your game.  Now, having read this thread and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=167551" rel="nofollow">the one about modes of thinking</a>, it should not surprise you that each one of these modes of thinking about roleplaying produces games that rest on different underlying assumptions.  Those assumptions have effects on far more than just bangs.  They affect nearly every aspect of the game, from how authority is distributed to what sort of procedures you use to the basic properties of the imagined world.  In other words, Radical mode thinking produces not only Radical-style bangs, but a Radical-styled environment for those bangs to exist in.  That's what makes their version of bangs work.  Similarly, Strategist thinking will produce Stategist-style bangs, in a Strategist-styled environment.  When you take Radical-style bangs and put them in a Strategist-style environment, the support structure is radically different, and they don't work as well.  It would be like taking me and dropping me in Mongolia -- without the familiar landmarks and social institutions, I don't know if I'd even be able to feed myself.  But I could either view that as a problem relating to my intrinsic qualities (I don't speak Mongolian, for one), or a problem related to some whole other element (Mongolian geography, for example.)  Neither is wrong -- they're both true, but they're both partial.<br/><br/>So when people start talking about bangs, it often goes like this:<br/><br/>Radical: "This is what a bang is.  You should do it like this."<br/>Strategist: "Nuh-uh.  When I do that, all these other bad things happen."<br/>Radical: "All those bad things happen because you're not using bangs correctly.  They should be based on XYZ."<br/><br/>Manager: "Yeah, come on.  Who really enjoys getting kicked in the nuts that much?  Masochists."<br/>Strategist and Radical together: "Sigh."<br/><br/>Strategist: "XYZ?  Are you out of your mind?  XYZ ruins the fun every time.  You're doing bangs all wrong.  What you need to do is JKL."<br/>Radical: "Oh no.  I've seen what happens when you do JKL -- all sorts of fail."<br/>Strategist: "That's because you're not doing JKL correctly.  It needs to be strongly based on RST."<br/>Radical: "RST?  Dear lord no.  You're still playing games with RST?  Poor soul."<br/><br/>Manager: "Clearly bangs are the wrong way to play."<br/>Strategist and Radical together: "Shut up, heathen."<br/><br/>So...where do we go from there?<br/><br/>A first step is to recognize that we're having that conversation.  From the posts in this thread, I'd say some people do and some people do not.  (That, of course, is one of the dangers of the internet.)  A second step is to realize that there is no objective reality of bangs.  There are a number of different perspectives, that, when taken together, form a cloud of bang-like concepts.  Depending on which angle you look at that cloud from, different pieces of it stick out.  So a third step is to begin to self-identify what perspective you're looking at it from.  If your core values line up more with the Strategist than the Radical, that's helpful information for you and for everyone else.  It tells us what sort of fun you're looking to get from bangs, and that also helps everyone spot what sorts of biases we can expect you to have.  A fourth step would be to accept biases as a natural part of having a perspective.  In other words, know that you're never going to get someone else to see what you see until they step out of their own perspective.  You can tell them what you see, but as they listen, they'll be trying to match it up with what they're seeing. When it doesn't, you'll sound wrong to them.  Conversely, when what they say doesn't match up with what you see, they'll sound wrong to you.  The nature of this conversation will never change until one person relinquishes their perspective, stands up, and walks over to where the other person is.  "Oh, that's what you were describing!"  You're the only person under your control, so you can't make anyone else do this.  Be the first is a fantastic step five.  A sixth step would be to abandon the "let's have one monolithic conversation about bangs" approach, in favor of narrower conversations about each perspective.  Maybe something like "let's talk about bangs in the context of Warrior thinking."<br/><br/>That's the sort of process that the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=167551" rel="nofollow">table</a> is intended to help with, and that's what this thread is intended to be about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170473/#Comment_170473" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T08:32:29+00:00" title="September 22, 2008  8:32AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2008 8:37AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max, <br/><br/>Good sum-up there and thanks for bringing up those points. <br/><br/>Interestingly enough, I understand and respect what you're saying, but strongly disagree. My off the top of my head reason for disagreeing so strongly, ironically enough, can be summed up as "Max and I seem to be using very different perspectives to look at this". Does that mean that by disagreeing with you I actually agree? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Or to put it another way, I think it's possible for people to see each other's perspectives without relinquishing their own, but I admit that the actual world outside my window doesn't seem to work that way very often. But rather than get bogged down to that, I'll table my issues with the way you're presenting the various perspectives; they're abstractions, but they're probably close enough for this conversation<br/><br/>From a down-to-earth perspective, I've run games with folks I'd describe as having Manager-style viewpoints, hit them hard with bangs, and had them enjoy them thoroughly. The way they approached the situation was illuminating -- when faced with problem X that they could call on resource Y to help "fix", and then later had to deal with the issues that came from calling on Y so strongly, etc... you can imagine basically the "my PC's life keeps going to crap" scenario like the stereotypical "bad bangs" above, in terms of how you might have imagine they'd respond to it. That is, feeling that they would be screwed no matter what outcome, and thus not enjoying themselves. (Looking back I think I was pretty heavy-handed with this stuff, and consider how I used bangs to be pretty close to the "bad use" examples above.)<br/><br/>The actual outcome, though, was to get them really frickin' engaged in what was going on, because no matter how bad things got, they could have easily been much worse. In other words, optimizing a definately bad situation so that it goes as non-catastrophically as possible can be as satisfying to a Manager mindset as optimizing a possibly bad situation to go as well as possible. There were no "clear right answers" but the player's own sense of prioritization led them to see these kinds of situations as having clear best outcomes, even if none are good ones. <br/><br/>I guess that's another element of Bangs that hasn't come up much in this thread -- that even when you present a situation that <i>you</i> perceive as having no clear right answer, the person dealing with the situation might not even consider it a strong "decision point". The cognitive dissonance you get in a group when this happens is pure gold, in my opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170478/#Comment_170478" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T09:05:22+00:00" title="September 22, 2008  9:05AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweeney Todd:<br/>I don't think there's any point in thinking that folks can never change from mindset to mindset per Max's formulation.<br/><br/>Certainly, a player can enjoy crisis management, which is basically what you're describing. I'd even expect a Manager type to dig it at some level. <br/><br/>What I'd really be interested in, however, is what the interaction was between that/those manager types and some of the other types that may have been present at the same session. For example, did you have folks who were more bang-positive kleading by example? Had your Manager type(s) had any experience with banginess.

You mentioned resources, optimization, prioritization, and lack of clear answers right answers, all of which lead me to believe you may be referring to the Strategist.  The Manager is more about principles, right/wrong, clear roles, and so on.  Am I misunderstanding you?\n<blockquote>I guess that's another element of Bangs that hasn't come up much in this thread -- that even when you present a situation that<i>you</i>perceive as having no clear right answer, the person dealing with the situation might not even consider it a strong "decision point". The cognitive dissonance you get in a group when this happens is pure gold, in my opinion.</blockquote>\nI can see how that situation can either go really well, or really poorly.  On the good end, I can see a situation where someone in Radical mode presents an open-ended decision point.  A player in Manager mode sees that there is a clear right choice and executes on that premise.  The Radical loves their statement on the situation, while the Manager feels good about doing the right thing.  On the bad end, I can see a situation where someone in Radical mode presents an open-ended decision point that contrasts two of the Manager's principles to see what they'll choose.  The Manager feels that they've been backed into corner -- no matter what, in order to do the right thing, they have to do the wrong thing.  That's the sort of situation that can kill someone's fun and enthusiasm, pushing them out of the imagined space.  If the Manager in this example is seeking immersive play, this is the sort of cognitive double-bind that is likely to kill their immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7655/why-bangs" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7655/why-bangs" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7655/why-bangs/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7655%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7655%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
