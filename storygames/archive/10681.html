I agreed to run a short campaign for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my GM-ing experience is with World of Darkness. Needless to say, Paranoia seems TOTALLY different. I'm a little worried that I'll screw it up by either a) not being funny enough or b) misjudging how heavily to push the whole 'screw-the-player' aesthetic that the authors of both editions are always trying to encourage. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know the game has some fans on this forum. Any advice for me? One other thing that perplexes me is how the GM is supposed to communicate with players during AP - are you always supposed to speak in the Voice of the Computer? Or if not, how does one transition smoothly back and forth between just giving the players basic info and taking on the persona of a deranged, omniscient heap of silicon?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236957/#Comment_236957" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T20:06:26+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  8:06PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to have some angry Traitor-with-a-chip-on-his-shoulder Green be the primary contact for some fresh Reds.  He should give the characters their mission.  Individually, take one or two of the players aside from the rest as the Green and promise their characters glorious recompense for exposing the Traitors within the group (you know what kind of Traitors they are).<br/><br/>Then take the PCs individually into some kind of confessional for a private briefing with the Computer and have the Computer offer instructions and advice that are totally at odds with their commanding Green.  If the character expresses concern over these countervailing instructions, have the Computer express sincere concern for the PCs well-being and loyalty.  And then vaporize them on the spot and have them replaced with a clone before the mission even starts.  If, back in the briefing room one of the characters is not obsequious enough in deference to a query by the Computer, vaporize them too for good measure.  Sets the tone.<br/><br/>I think it's best to assume there are times when the characters think or know the Computer cannot see/hear them.  They'll get into more trouble that way.  And perhaps the Computer really can't see/hear them in most cases.  The Computer shouldn't be omnipresent and omnicient.  Just insane.  Played right, the characters will get into enough trouble on their own, with each other and with the mission obstacles.  If you want to keep the Computer present as a general rule, send them to a part of the complex that has no Computer presence.  Or outside for a time.<br/><br/>Even when the Computer isn't around, I find myself slipping into Computer mode as the GM.  The players get to stay in "fall over themselves with loyalty statements mode."  Which is fun.<br/><br/>I love Paranoia.  It helped keep me sane and in good humor during the Reagan years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236962/#Comment_236962" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T23:19:19+00:00" title="October 11, 2009 11:19PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2009 11:19PM by ccreitz.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my very favorite games! Do use the Second Edition as your inspiration; the Fifth Edition is an unproduct and further mention will result in termination. (Unless you really like smoking boots slapstick, which is awesome in its own way... in that case, you'll want Fifth.) I used to run it every year as an intro game for freshmen at the Pitt gaming club, and it never failed me.<br/><br/>Here's how I like to be The Computer:<br/>Decide how The Computer sounds, and be consistent! I liked to play the role as a sort of insane Scoutmaster, always eager to get up first thing in the daycycle, get everybody hopped up on drugs, and go find trouble to shoot! Every sentence ends with one or more exclamation points! You may prefer the HAL, or the Kraftwerk, or the deadpan snarker. Whatever you decide, be consistent about your The Computer voice and your distinct GM voice.<br/>Remember that you're everybody's friend. Assume that they feel the same way. Make them feel guilty when they don't feel that way. Only vaporize them once you've done that.<br/>Remember that your point of view is mounted to the ceiling (when appropriate). Stand up, stand on your chair if it's safe; do what it takes to get above the players.<br/>Invade the players' space. If they're hiding something, and you want to see it, then "zoom in" on them.<br/>If your group is OK with drugs, use the hell out of them. Drugs are a punishment, and drugs are a reward. "CITIZEN, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME DRUGS?" is a great way to get a scene going (the only acceptable answer is "Yes, Friend Computer!"). Savvy GMs will realize that the drug descriptions are like cues for that classic improv game where one player leaves the room, everyone else gets a cue, and then the first guy comes back and everyone tries to get him to guess what they're acting out. Family fun for all!<br/>Ditto Secret Societies. If you're at a loss for what to do next, do a secret society contact. It's easy to forget about them, which is why...<br/>You should keep a single sheet of paper with you listing each character's name, mutant power, secret society, Mandatory Bonus Duty, and quirk (if your edition has them... if not, consider implementing them). Ping them often. Honor your players' flags!<br/>Awesome Secret Society hack: make everyone a member of the same one. Make them all Commies, in fact. Don't tell them, though. Let 'em sweat. My favorite scenario seed: everyone is a Communist, and the team, in furtherance of the battle against the Commie Mutant Traitor menace, has been given an R&amp;D Communist Detector that works flawlessly. Hijinks always ensue.<br/>If you have a shrinking violet player, ping his flags until he stops shrinking violets. Smile while you do it, make it clear you're not picking on him - you're making him the star! This is a great game for getting to those players.<br/>Failure is supposed to be fun. It's what Troubleshooters are best at. Help the players figure out what the awesomest way to fail is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236966/#Comment_236966" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T02:58:10+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  2:58AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2009 2:58AM by Georgios.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paranoia is one of those games that are almost impossible to run badly. If all else fails you can always turn them into loud and dumb fun. Which is great, if that's what you're after. But there's a little more meat to the game than that.<br/><br/>To me the most important bit about running Paranoia is restraint. As a GM it's not your job to antagonise and frustrate the players, by giving them impossible jobs, useless equipment, murderous NPCs and an utterly insane computer. Your goal should be to sow distrust, leave them in an uneasy state of ambiguity about what is going on and casually up the stakes until the state of fear and ignorance drives the players to do outwardly insane and ridiculous things, in an attempt to get away from the madness and danger. The greatest moments of humour in Paranoia stem from misunderstandings, wrong assumptions and behaviour that seems completely random and unpredictable to the uninitiated. <br/><br/>To do that Paranoia gives you an endless number of tools and options (secret societies, secret missions, bureaucracy gone haywire, R&amp;D equipment, and so on). It can seem overwhelming at first and I would strongly advise you not to try to use every part of the mission to screw with the players. I've found that most players have a fairly low threshold for random, useless crap that is just going to get their characters into trouble. While hosejobs are a staple of Paranoia adventures, I think that they really only work with a group that does not expect them. Considering the game's reputation, this is not particularly likely to happen. You should give your players the chance to realise that there is a method to the madness that is Alpha Complex. Only to then change it around a little. In other words always keep your players guessing how this is supposed to work, but make sure not to leave them so deep in the dark, that they simply throw their hands up and start randomly shooting each other for the hell of it. <br/><br/>So basically, make the players paranoid. The only way to do it, is by allowing them to have a stake in what's going on. And the only way to do that is by giving them a chance to "win". At the very least they have to believe that they can "win". Otherwise the only thing you're left with is loud, dumb fun. Which is fun for a while, but I'd wager you'll burn out of running or playing Paranoia very quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236970/#Comment_236970" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T06:30:36+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  6:30AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually saddle the (new to Paranoia) PCs with a Medical Robot.

But of course they can't destroy it as that would be treason.<br/><br/>It gives the group a more to immediate focus, and sets up a decent amount of tension.  If it becomes too much, then it breaks down and they have to figure out how to drag it along to the end of the mission.<br/><br/>Also, I'd say start them in the briefing, as just getting to the briefings can be rather deadly for newbie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236979/#Comment_236979" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T07:14:38+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  7:14AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2009 7:18AM by Graham.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's much easier to GM Paranoia than to describe how to do it. The examples in the book are the best guide. (Use 2nd Edition, not 5th).<br/><br/>You don't speak as the Computer all the time. You'll probably have a "Computer voice", which you use to signify you're talking as the Computer. Mine is silky-smooth, polite and slightly motherly.<br/><br/>You need to introduce situations that screw the characters over. It also relies on the PCs screwing each other over: you need your players to do the player-vs-player thing.<br/><br/>Is there such a thing as a Paranoia "campaign"? Perhaps a series of short adventures.

For example, you see the plot in the back of 2nd edition, which ends up with giant cockroaches? Don't do that. It's too long. The bit at the end is great, but the whole thing is too long.<br/><br/>The best Paranoia mission <i>ever</i>, in my opinion, which is correct, is Robot Imana-665-C. It's in the First Edition and has been released as part of Paranoia Flashbacks. As far as I can find out, neither of those are still available, which makes this paragraph a bit useless.<br/><br/>Anyway. It's a mission in which Troubleshooters are told to go and repair a robot. It's short (the players will lengthen it by infighting) and inconsequential. All Paranoia adventures should be like that: go here, do this <i>perfectly simple thing</i> that turns out to be stupidly complicated. Similarly, there's a mission in which the Troubleshooters must go to the bottom of the sea, but they haven't been given an instruction manual for the submarine. <br/><br/>You get the picture. Simple, stupid, inconsequential and needlessly complicated.<br/><br/>By the way, I <i>would</i> link you to Paranoia Flashbacks, so you could buy it, but it doesn't seem to be available anywhere.
