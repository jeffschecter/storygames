I like both of those games. What they do, though, is very different from the "adventure fiction" style of some traditional RPGs. I'm curious about the possibility of Myth Arcs in GMless games. Myth Arcs, for those who haven't heard the phrase, are long-term stories with secrets and questions that are paid off at the end of a particular section of a story's plot. They're often my favorite part of long-form storytelling.<br/><br/>Those of you with more GMless experience than I have (read: all of you), have you found a way to incorporate these kinds of grand mysteries into GMless games? Or is this type of storytelling truly reliant on the separation of storyteller (GM) and audience (players)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472961/#Comment_472961" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T14:45:16+00:00" title="April 27, 2018  2:45PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do the secrets have to be kept secret from the players, or just from the characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472963/#Comment_472963" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T15:30:07+00:00" title="April 27, 2018  3:30PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2018 3:58PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It\u2019s possible to do a Myth Arc with GMless games, but how you do so is going to be contingent upon what your design goals are for the game at large. How easy it will be to design will also depend on your other game design goals and exactly what your trying to do.<br/><br/>I\u2019m not aware of a game that does an awesome job at this\u2014probably, because it\u2019s kind of like swimming up stream and designers with this goal just choose to use a GMed form. <br/><br/>Anyway, if you want to add a mechanic that will help to give this affect, with an already existing game, I can likely come up with a solution for you if you give me more detail about specifically what your after and let me know what game you\u2019d like to use for the foundation. It would obviously be a less then ideal solution, but you could refine it over time... it\u2019s a hard design to do well, so you might have to settle for 80% of what your after\u2014unless you convinced a good designer to put a lot of time and energy into it\u2014depending on exactly the gameplay effects your after. <br/><br/>P.S. I would probably us a PbtA style game and adapt it to a rotating GMed game, and then use a myth arc scaffolding-design tech in which one would plug in big questions (based on things players wanted answers to as the plot emerged).  Big questions would be continually added based on how the narrative emerged.  Nothing would be framed narratively or plotted out before hand, the scaffolding would simply be a tech tool for these things to emerge. The plot would be driven by the answers to these big questions, and would have secret information emerging in play rather than being prepared beforehand, of course building to the biggest question being answered  and the mystery being revealed, once it built to the final mystery (ie question and answer).  None of these questions would be formulated before play, they would come out of play and be formulated as a result of the narrative and players wanting to answer narrative questions. Anyway, this would be the main mechanic and you could do a lot of other stuff depending on what you wanted to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472964/#Comment_472964" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T16:33:55+00:00" title="April 27, 2018  4:33PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so like realistically for this,  you need the arc mechanized and/or total player buy-in on exploring the arc. <br/>A good example of a GMless game that does this well is <i>Polaris: Chivalric Tragedy at the Utmost North</i>,  which very much builds the arc into the game (with the concrete endgame of Polaris falling and the main characters dying.

The difference between playing a game together and straight-up storyboarding as a group, to me, is the element of surprise (dice are emblematic of this).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a> I'm actually asking because I just gutted some unnecessary GM stuff from my pet project, and I realized I could probably make it GMless at this point. This, the overarching mystery, is the only thing that immediately comes to mind as something I value highly that might get lost if I made that design decision. I didn't categorize the thread as "game design help" because I'm mostly interested in everyone's experience and opinions of existing games. Could you give a quick definition of the "scaffolding-design tech" you mentioned? If it's that's specific, extant thing, I'm not familiar with it.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">@EmmatheExcrucian</a> Polaris sounds really interesting, but it seems like it explicitly doesn't allow for overarching mysteries. Unless I'm misunderstanding, which is always possible. As a side note, I think I've seen you post a couple of times about your preference for strongly structured narratives in games, as opposed to emergent stories. Can I ask, and I mean this entirely without judgement, what is the draw of a game where you know going in how it will end? Is it mainly the pleasure of getting into a character's headspace?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hyades" title="hyades"><img alt="hyades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/458/nC00J8GI62UXP.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hyades">hyades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472969/#Comment_472969" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T19:44:05+00:00" title="April 27, 2018  7:44PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm only aware of a few GM-less rpgs that do long-term play, period. So that is its own design challenge, I guess (how long-term are we talking anyways?).<br/><br/>As far as mysteries go I like the approach Lovecraftesque takes: Every scene has someone describing a clue, just something that is off about the scene. Then after the scene is played, everyone "leaps to conclusions" secretly writing down what they believe is behind the clue. This continues throughout play with the players revising their individual conclusions based upon the clues that come into play. The game ends with someone just deciding to present their conclusion as the truth, the payoff, if you will. That way no one knows whats really going on right until the end. <br/><br/>Another technique (from Directions Storyplaying System) is just assigning the mystery to a single player Archipelago-style, who is then responsible for revealing it over the course of play.<br/><br/>Swords without Master (very weak GM-role) has Mysteries that are written down on a card during play and put into the middle of the table. In the endgame players may "reincorporate" those into the story by answering the mystery in sort of an epilogue-fashion.<br/><br/>I've recently tried to implement a mystery in my character's goal in Remember Tomorrow (GM-less Cyberpunk game built for campaign play) and it just paralysed the other players. The lesson is probably to state as clearly as possible who is allowed to resolve that and over what timeframe they're supposed to do it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mabgriff" title="mabgriff"><img alt="mabgriff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mabgriff">mabgriff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472970/#Comment_472970" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T19:52:49+00:00" title="April 27, 2018  7:52PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/hyades">@hyades</a> Those are great examples.

I apologize.<br/><br/>The draw for me is telling the story, seeing the details, acting through it, experiencing the emotional catharsis that comes with occupying those moments. <br/>With media, I'm just in general far more interested in the details than the big picture, as long as the big picture is well-written so that it doesn't pull me out of the experience. And basically when we pre-plan narrative, it's establishing that big picture, making sure the big picture is going to be good so it doesn't pull us out of the experience, and then in play we focus on the details, the <i>how</i> of the story instead of the <i>what</i>.<br/>I'm the type who with media reads spoilers before watching/reading/playing something, because without the spoilers, I haven't developed a reason to care about it yet. <br/>I just in general also don't value the element of surprise at all in my media, and value it even less in my roleplaying. <br/>Another part of it is that I view roleplaying as a very writing-adjacent sort of thing, and in a group writing project, it doesn't make sense for the authors to be lost on where things are going, because the authors are outlining and stuff, putting ideas together. So thus for the way I view roleplaying, the players not knowing where it's going doesn't make much sense to me.<br/><br/>Does that help explain?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472979/#Comment_472979" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T21:28:12+00:00" title="April 27, 2018  9:28PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2018 9:32PM by DeReel.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My 2cts.<br/>Every dramatic conflict is a promise that the plot moves forward. In a mystery these conflicts are just questions. The fuel is curiosity (usually with a twist of fear or something, but not necessarily). <br/><br/>I like a dynamic narrative structure, with short term along with long term conflicts. Empowering players to adjust the tempo of the questions and answers to their fiction is a way of ensuring the reveals will come at the right time for them. <br/><br/>Most games severely frame dramatic conflicts, in 2 ways : 1\xb0 players can create only short term conflicts, and 2\xb0 only the rules or GM can fix long term conflicts (with the excuse of enforcing a genre, warranting a neat story, or any other pretext really). <br/><br/>I know of 3 games that have dramatic conflict creation and resolution at their core, and all 3 are GMful (not GMled) : Annalise (claims), Capes (goals), and my own Utopian Chronicles (objectives).<br/><br/>I am not saying your game should use such a mechanic. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At all.</span> You can certainly look at these games. They do mystery and surprise very well in my opinion. It's like : some things that seem complicated within other frameworks are very easy with this dramatic mechanic. But there is a "and vice versa"...<br/><br/>TLDR : You can totally do mysteries and reveals without a GM or authoritarian rules. Your game can include the tools for the players to navigate through their own homemade mystery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472985/#Comment_472985" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T22:06:36+00:00" title="April 27, 2018 10:06PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2018 10:07PM by BeePeeGee.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As <a href="/forums/profile/hyades">@hyades</a> mentioned, in <i><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/storyplaying" rel="nofollow">Directions Storyplaying</a></i> I used to have a "Secret Keeper" - one player as the final guardian of a mystery.<br/><br/>With the consulting help by Ron Edwards, I've recently redesigned and streamlined Directions. I've moved out the "Secret Keeper" concept and replaced it with a "Mystery Plot Sheet":<br/><img alt="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/7jVShEl.png"/><br/><br/>This approach has been more satisfactory because it enhances the GMless <i>collaborative</i> approach in Directions Storyplaying.<br/>How it works:<br/>- With rotating hosts, players roleplay different scenes. In these scenes, various questions and clues related to the mystery pop up.<br/>- Both during in-character roleplaying as well as OOC brainstorming, there is speculation (guesswork) about plausible resolution for the mystery. <br/>- Ultimately for the final resolution of the mystery, I usually use a "Random Table on the Fly" (core resolve mechanism for Directions). So, players brainstorm up to 6 different possible outcomes (i.e. Who is the murderer? - 1/2:John 3/4:Butler 5/6:Widow). Then, during roleplaying at a suitable moment, a die is rolled and the mystery is resolved (roll a 4: it was the butler!).<br/><br/>This is not a fool-proof method and to me mysteries still remain the holy grail of GMless play. Nevertheless, this allows collaborative GMless play that gradually navigates towards resolving a mystery together.<br/><br/>Another approach (sorry, don't remember the source anymore) I liked:<br/>Players write index cards with potential clues for the mystery. They shuffle the index cards and build a pile face down . Whenever they research, they draw a card and find a clue.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473005/#Comment_473005" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-28T22:17:20+00:00" title="April 28, 2018 10:17PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here\u2019s a one shot gmLess game I made (200 words exactly).

Part of that is very similar to what I have in mind for character advancement. Essentially, I was thinking about having each character choose themes with an initial state, then every play session have them write a one-line summary of any scenes key to their themes and mark XP. When they feel the character has reached a satisfactory endpoint for the theme, they would get a lump sum of XP based on how many scenes that theme had. I was thinking this might be a way to ensure some of the coherent character story <a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">@EmmatheExcrucian</a> was talking about in a system that is otherwise less structured.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/davey">@davey</a> I'm noticing a recurring thing with GMless or GMful mystery games, which is that the answer to the mystery isn't just a secret until the end. If I'm reading these right, the answer <i>doesn't exist</i> until the end. I'm undecided about this. Gradually inventing the truth is fundamentally different than gradually uncovering the truth, but maybe they're subjectively interchangeable as long as your solution is validated at the end of play.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">@Lisa Padol</a> I've never heard of that one, I'll check it out <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473219/#Comment_473219" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-03T19:06:57+00:00" title="May  3, 2018  7:06PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's definitely just a difference of tastes. <br/>And I definitely would find that component a nuisance, but otherwise enjoy stuff like Microscope. <br/><br/>The key themes thing for me wouldn't work, because for me a core thing is that I don't like the uncertainty that comes with less strongly structured narratives, because the level of uncertainty that comes when you don't have an outline stresses me out and makes me not have fun. <br/>However, I'm also most likely far from your intended audience, and for people who want a coherent story within the "play to find out what happens" style, your XP sum for themes thing sound like it would work really really well, and do what you're intending with it.<br/><br/>Also, I'll second <a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a> 's recommendation on Annalise.

My game does this in installments. You could however reveal each stage as you go (one per session or something) in a different kind of design. <br/><br/>Yesterday I started thinking about using the enneagram as a map for a heroic arc. I used to hang out with some people in a \u201cGurdjieff group\u201d who were really into this model for describing processes instead of the more common personality typing diagram you see it used as.  I\u2019m at step  zero with that idea though, and odds are it won\u2019t pan out...  <br/><br/>Emma:  I heard about the results of a study recently that found that spoilers not only didn\u2019t ruin people\u2019s enjoyment of media, but significantly increased immersive enjoyment in stories. Your feeling is right in line with this finding. I wish I could remember the source. It was discussed in an npr show I think.

But the study is not about spoilers it seems, it's more about extra information. Well, information is like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil" rel="nofollow">apple with 2 sides</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473968/#Comment_473968" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-15T17:08:03+00:00" title="May 15, 2018  5:08PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            tbh,  I find spoilers are ever more useful to me when something has a big twist,  but then it gets me in on what the work is truly about,  and gets me excited to see how the twist is executed,  and how the characters react to it. <br/>Like for instance Doki Doki Literature Club is a game people say you shouldn't spoil yourself on because of twists,  and what finally sold me on playing it was reading a detailed plot synopsis that told me absolutely everything and got me excited about seeing how they handled it in practice, how they executed the cool stuff I was reading descriptions of,  what everything was like in context,  and then I went and downloaded it immediately and loved, whereas before I'd been lukewarm and had been planning to play it eventually because people had told me it was good,  but I didn't know enough to be excited about it yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
