Oil bottles are still my favorite, since our Pathfinder GM allowed us to use it in so many different situations. The first time, we spilled it over a senile beholder and drop a torch on it. That was on level 1. We're on level 4 and it seems that when we go back to the dungeon we will still find it burning (GM stated magical fires burn for ages). The last time I tied powder charge to the bottle to get rid of a zombie problem. Not to mention you can always pour some on you for some bonus to your escape artist skill...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389176/#Comment_389176" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T10:27:25+00:00" title="September  4, 2012 10:27AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now, it's a little toy we've invented that we call Dark Tiles. They're carryable two dimensional energy absorption devices that suck up light, sound or any other kind of energy. The user is perpetually shrouded in a dark haze that makes it easier to hide in darkness and sneak around. As an unintended off shoot of the technology, when they touch, they form a 4 dimensional pocket dimension and the user is drawn into it, vanishing along with the tiles from ordinary space. When the user separates the tiles, they are returned to normal space.<br/><br/>They come in extremely handy.

It was explicitly hinted to have potential not yet unlocked, but honestly that one schtick (a sword, so good at fighting, and linked to people's fears) was enough combined with Nobilis 3e's Treasure rules. He didn't use it much but when he DID draw it forth it felt so badass.<br/><br/>In an old D&amp;D 3.5 game, I had a warlock with an <i>eternal wand of servant horde</i>. Eternal Wands had per-day uses, rather than charges, and Servant Horde was a spell that got you something like 1d6+level unseen servants for level hours, so in the wand's case, my warlock was basically never without a small army of unseen servants at his beck and call. We made more jokes about his fully furnished portable hole ("Looks like it's time to get in my hole again, guys") but that wand was <i>nice</i>, in a sense of luxury and style.<br/><br/>Running Everway, I once had the characters acquire a ruby key from a man of dubious morality. Used in any door, it transformed that doorway into a portal to an extradimensional harem, staffed with succubi bound to respect and obey the owner of the key and any of their invited guests. There was a back door in the harem that the key's owner was advised not to go through. The characters were way too classy to use the item's obvious intended purpose, but it made a handy extra-dimensional stowing space and means of smuggling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389244/#Comment_389244" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T18:25:42+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  6:25PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2012 6:25PM by Felan.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A player in my Pathfinder game used poisoned gourmet coffee, a very high bluff roll, and a coup de grace to take out a minor boss monster.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389250/#Comment_389250" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T19:54:25+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  7:54PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a long time I played an Akashic Brother whose weapon of choice was the <a href="http://video.adultswim.com/the-boondocks/the-black-power-fist.html" rel="nofollow">Black Power Fist</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389252/#Comment_389252" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T20:07:21+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  8:07PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Casks of wine; because, when you're twelve, older wine has more alcohol and alcohol burns so casks of ancient wine must act like barrels of gasoline, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389257/#Comment_389257" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T20:27:51+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  8:27PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a group of players who hadn't read Elric so I gave them Stormbringer.

They also got living armors, psychic crystals, healing armors... and got cursed by all of these items, slowly becoming undeads attached to such hellish items.<br/><br/>Later one of the players made me paid for that, when he GMed another campaign where I ended up using an armor infused with the soul of the best friend of one of the main bad guys.
