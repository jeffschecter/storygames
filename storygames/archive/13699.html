Okay, it's two lines in the original doc. Anyway.<br/><br/>The hack is this: <br/>Part 1 - bonus dice<br/>Whenever you commit to an action, and are faced with a danger beyond the Standard Danger, you get a poker chip. You may spend these immediately, or hold onto them. <br/>If you spend one poker chip, you may narrate a flashback involving yourself, for the purpose of explaining why you're particularly well-suited to handle whatever thing you're about to do. If you do so, and it's a reasonable argument (GM is encouraged to be generous), you get a bonus die.<br/>If you spend three chips, you may narrate a flashback involving yourself, and the thing you're good at is a permanent thing - you mark it down on your character sheet/card. You get a bonus die whenever that power or talent you possess is relevant to the action. <br/><br/>We briefly quibbled over whether you could spend chips you'd just earned, and decided to allow it. <br/><br/>Part 2 - danger dice<br/>Instead of assigning dice as you wish, you must have at least one red, one green, one blue, and one yellow d6 on hand. The blue die is always your Goal Die; the red is always your Standard Danger; green is GM-authored Danger; yellow is player-authored Danger.<br/>Your bonus dice may be swapped in to replace any other dice, one for one. <br/><br/>Part 3 - helping and sharing<br/>You can give other people bonus dice that you'd have for the action, if you want. Teamwork is encouraged.<br/>You can spend one poker chip to establish a fact about an NPC. -- this bit we played a bit fast and loose, and not very often. <br/><br/>AP is gonna be in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13573&amp;page=1#Item_57" rel="nofollow">Bite Sized Jan-2011 thread</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310062/#Comment_310062" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T09:51:34+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  9:51AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did part 2 work out?

Having some options, via the bonus dice, is good, but it's a bit of a hassle to assign four dice, every time. <br/>Honestly, though, the GM was so central to the process - reminding us each time how resolution worked, bringing out half-cards and writing down dangers (the better to keep them "on the table") - that the dice colors became associated with the different dangers and such, but the job of assigning them really was a group effort. <br/><br/>It seems like the drive was towards using lots of flashbacks - you could get a one-off justification for an ability for one chip, or a permanent ability for three. Not that many permanent abilities were actually achieved, and in one of my two cases when I wrote something down, it was because the GM misunderstood me and chagred me three chips for a "temporary" ability - not quite sure why I went along with this without intending to (I guess I didn't miss the chips), although I didn't mind getting the extra ability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
