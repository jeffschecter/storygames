I won't be there personally, but Paul Czege's going to be representing it on my behalf, because he's awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Rustbelt is a game of grim misadventure in a place where the apocalypse is now, desperation and hardship are the norm, and the Rust eats not only the abandoned machines and ghost towns, but civilization and even the laws of nature.  To give you a Hollywood-style mashup, it's sort of Sin City meets the Wild Bunch meets Mad Max.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book itself is half-letter size and saddlestitched.  I did the cover art, photography, and design myself.  There's no interior illustrations because, unfortunately, there was not enough time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlued inside the back cover is an envelope containing <b>a 6-track CD </b>of original music based on the Rustbelt, for purposes of audio illustration.  I recorded, performed, and wrote (except the lyrics to one of 'em, written by a friend) it all myself.  The music is sort of rootsy and bluesy, with a dash of industrial for good measure. The production is ramshackle, rough, and crude for maximum rustiness.  The music sounds like rust looks.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrice tag is gonna be $10.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhaddya think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162209/#Comment_162209" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-12T06:43:44+00:00" title="August 12, 2008  6:43AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chocolate awesome.

I figure that's mostly a social issue, and I'm gonna need input from lots of different people in lots of different social contexts to get it figured out.  There were also some technique-based concerns, many of which I fixed in the process of making the ashcan (the prep technique in the book, which I'm very fond of, is one of those).<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham,<br/>\nI'll take all the luck I can get.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figured I should do something with my ashcan to make it unique and personal.  Since I can do music, I decided I would.

Which makes it a Savvy check, unless perhaps he piled up a bunch of heavy furniture and shit against the door, which would make it a Tough check.  And his effectiveness in this can be represented by a heavy lock, a reinforced door, bars, a barricade, whatever makes sense.   You're allowed to handle this stuff abstractly.  In fact, in the rules for unopposed (i.e. against a target number and not a person) rolls, the GM decides the difficulty (in keeping with his job to provide fit opposition) <i>then</i> describes why it's that hard.  In other words, the difficulty and the locks/bars/blockade/whatever associated with it <i>don't even really exist</i> until they become relevant.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?  Sometimes (a lot of times) I'm not good at explaining rules issues.<br/><br/>Dave,<br/>Thank you for that!
