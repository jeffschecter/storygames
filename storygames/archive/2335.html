                    So I've been running a Firefly game recently using the Dogs in the Vineyard system lately. I had gotten a lukewarm reception to DitV when I proposed it, and a few moans of "Sheesh, not ANOTHER western!" So I switched gears and made it Firefly. The game has been going well and I've got some cool characters to work with, but feel like the game is starting to lose momentum after a few game sessions. I was hoping a few of you gaming virtuosos might be willing to toss a few ideas my way, help me flesh out a game I feel has some cool potential.<br/><br/>The game is set about a year after the events of the movie Serenity. The Alliance Senate is in chaos over the "Miranda Incident", and has withdrawn military support from the border worlds in order to maintain stability in the Core. Left to fend for themselves, the border worlds are falling prey to piracy, famine and infighting, and a second Succession War is on the brink of breaking out. A group of idealists have formed a political faction called the Independent League, moved to Miranda, and have begun distributing supplies from the abandoned cites on Miranda to the impoverished border worlds. A group of volunteers called the Rangers haven taken up the task of distributing the supplies and helping out the border communities as a sort of freelance police. The players are Rangers.<br/><br/>The game is based around the crew of the Pegasus, a firefly class transport much like the Serenity, only newer and in better condition.<br/><br/>The Pegasus is captained by a tomboyish former horse rancher named Alex. Alex is played by my wife, Jen, who is new to role-playing and frankly a bit intimidated by it. Much of the game kinda bores Jen, unless sheâ€™s given the chance to really get in someoneâ€™s face and screw with them. Sheâ€™s likes the verbal confrontations a lot. Alex doesnâ€™t even carry a gun, but has a bullwhip she can use to mess with people.<br/><br/>The Pegasusâ€™ pilot is James, who was part of a similar experiment to the one done on River. James is in his mid twenties, possibly ex-military, and has no memory before waking up one day in a Blue Sun medical facility and just â€˜walking out.â€™ James is a techno-kinetic, but heâ€™s delusional and thinks machines talk to him. Heâ€™s made good friends with a vending machine he decided to wire a transceiver to (in game! He took a relationship to the damn thing. It was awesome). James is played by Tony, who can be a handful sometimes in game. Heâ€™s very success driven, and very plan oriented.<br/><br/>The medical officer is Don, an AWOL alliance combat medic. Don is bitter and a bit mean; think a mix between Dr. McCoy and Han Solo. Don is played by Aaron, who for some reason always goes for the throat.<br/><br/>The crew is rounded out by Penelope, a concert pianist who fell into gambling debt and sold herself into servitude as a professional duelist. She ran away and is now on the run from a big time mob boss. She uses swords, mostly. Penny is played by Ruthie, Tonyâ€™s wife, who is a bit meek and loves a mystery.<br/><br/>So far the crew has uncovered a conspiracy on a mining colony (The Foreman and town Doc were covering up a radiation leak with a fake scurvy outbreak) and have been framed for murder when a guy hold their cargo hostage turned up dead. They are now on a watery moon clogged up by algae, trying to settle a dispute between conservationists and the terraformers. Iâ€™ve got an idea for the Pegasus to stumble upon a derelict Ark (one of the super-ships that brought everybody from Earth a few generations back) but Iâ€™m saving that for the â€˜season finale.â€™ Does anyone have any cool Firefly/DitV ideas they could throw my way?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>-Jake                </div>

<p>Let me know if these are in the right direction:</p>
<p><em>Meet the New Boss</em> - Alliance Feds land at the colony with official-looking papers in hand. They declare the Ranger's job done - but are they in fact up to the task? And are they really who they are?</p>
<p><em>Fair Trade</em> - The Arcatel Corporation willing to risk life, limb and property to run critical medical supplies through an Alliance blockade. The Rangers are greatful - until they uncover a seedier side of Arcatel's business model. Can the Ranger's afford to keep this ally?  [Aracetel buys and sells laborers to different planets at slave-wages or worse. Chance for a spotlight on Penelope, if Ruthie wants it.]</p>
<p><em>Two Steps Back</em> - A town is laid low by a brutal computer virus, and now are trying to destroy any and all technological items in their colony. Harmless luddites - or a dangerous mob? [Chance for spotlight on James, if Tony wants it.]</p>
<p><em>Wild Horses</em> - Alex comes back to her home town, but finds trouble is brewing betwene her old colleagues and a new and bustling business in hovercraft. Do old-fashioned horse ranchers still have a place in their world? [Spotlight on Alex if Jen wants it.]</p>

<p>Also, I'd be curious to dig into what your players want /don't, and come up with scenarios point at that. Would that be what you want to talk about?</p>

                            Curious you'd use the term "spotlight," DevP.<br/><br/>I've recently emailed my players and suggested creating "Spotlight Episodes" for each character, and asked for feedback as to what they'd want out of their episode. <br/><br/>So far I've only got a response from Aaron; he'd like to see a local power struggle between Blue Sun and the Alliance military, with the crew of the Pegasus stuck in the middle. Kinda make the players choose sides between the two, and different characters have very strong reasons NOT to side with one faction or the other. (James is terrified of Blue Sun, Don is AWOL from the Alliance Military). As for theme, I can foresee Aaron appreciating some good old fashioned violence too.<br/><br/>I know Ruthie likes mysteries and loves to build character relationships. Tony likes political games usually, but James isnâ€™t his â€˜typicalâ€™ character. Jenâ€¦  I really donâ€™t know. I think sheâ€™s only really in the game so she doesnâ€™t feel â€˜left out.â€™ I like the Wild Horses idea. <br/><br/>Hrmâ€¦ Jenâ€™s a big â€˜trashy romance novelâ€™ fan. Maybe Iâ€™ll run <i>Wild Horses</i> for Jen as a one-on-one side plot, and get a copy of Breaking the Ice to do it. <br/><br/>JD, while I love westerns and agree they are a great source of Firefly inspiration, I'm on a Classical Greek kick right now, and am happily devouring the super cool copy of the Illiad Jen got me for christmas.<br/><br/>(I will say recently buying Polaris, reading the Illiad and running a Firefly game has created fevered dreams of a Trojan War/Dying Empire/Space Opera/Polaris Spinoff game... but that's the insane ravings of another day)<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback!                        </div>

                            I'm not suggesting you read them for enjoyment! I'm suggesting you study them for ideas. It's a big difference. Remember writing book reports in school? 'Course ya do. I bet you didn't know you were being trained in campaign design, huh?                        </div>

                            Great Scott!  DevP, you are my hero.  I'm in a particularly dry spell of not being able to come up with *any* ideas.  Thank heavens my weekly Chill game is running on the last brainstorm I had.  Thank you - I plan to steal away with your ideas (and credit you, of course).                        </div>
