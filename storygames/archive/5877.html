I want to see if there's either an obvious flaw or a glaringly optimal path related to card-draw odds in this scheme:\n<blockquote>You have eleven points to spend to create your hero.<br/><br/>There are four possible Approaches to solving problems.  Approaches cost three points each, and your hero needs at least one.  The Approaches are:  With Grace (hearts), with Luck (diamonds), with Courage (clubs), and with Skill (spades).  That's just color at this point, don't worry about it.  <br/><br/>Any points you don\u2019t spend on Approaches are converted, one for one, into points of Resolve.  So, your hero can have three Approaches and two points of Resolve, or two Approaches and five points of Resolve, or one Approach and eight points of Resolve.<br/><br/>The game will be punctuated with challenges, which are resolved by drawing playing cards.  Challenges can usually be overcome using any Approach you\u2019ve chosen for your hero.  Difficult challenges might render a specific Approach impossible, but most of the time any Approach your hero possesses will be fair game to use.  Figure half the challenges will rule out a specific Approach - for example, "A deadly dart trap!" might explicitly rule out Approaching it with Courage, because it's a sneak attack.  No challenge will rule out more than one Approach, ever.  <br/><br/>When you encounter a challenge, draw a card from the deck.  If it matches any of the Approaches your hero possesses and is allowed to use, you succeed.  If it does not match, your hero immediately loses a point of Resolve.  You can choose to give up and fail the challenge, or you can draw again, hoping for a match and success.  However, if subsequent draws are also failures, your hero continues to lose a point of Resolve for each.<br/><br/>When Resolve reaches zero, your hero's journey ends in failure!</blockquote>\nSo ... I'd value your thoughts on whether one of the three builds is optimal and so forth.  If one is screamingly better - and I honestly can't tell this morning - I may just make it the default.  Also, if tuning the ratio of extreme challenges that forbid an Approach would change things, I can do that, too - it could be one in four instead of half, for example.  Oh!  You'll always be operating alone - just your dude vs. the challenge.  Thanks in advance, smart weird guys!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131551/#Comment_131551" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T06:59:59+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  6:59AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With one approach, you fail 75% of the time- your expected loss is -.75.

You need 1 card to get over 50% of success, and that's already your beginning position. Suppose 1 in 4 times you'll fail, that's roughly 11 challenges you play and win.<br/><br/>Challenges that forbid certain Approaches change your chances of winning a specific challenge, but not your relative chance compared to the other options, and totally rules out taking only one approach, since you need to win on your own, and you're automatically going to end your journey in 0.25*percentage of challenges that forbid an approach, no matter what.<br/><br/>I'll take the three Approaches route every time, if that's the only use of Resolve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131555/#Comment_131555" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T07:04:26+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  7:04AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't see that the default 'dangerous conflict ratio' is 1/2.

Mine say that basically you have a good balance between three approaches giving lots of success, but low endurance, and one approach giving low successes, but longer endurance. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is what you were after, no? I think that's a fine balance. In fact you chose the level of pool and costs that seem to balance them pretty darn closely, without fiddling a lot with it. That is, with the model you have, modifying up or down on either pool total, or approach cost throws the balance far, far off from what you have. <br/>\n<br/>\nNice intuitive work there. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe one concern I have - which might be assuaged if I knew the context better - is that 2 to 3 successes on average before the end of the adventure seems like very few. That is, you're going to have very short numbers of contests that you can throw at a player, and they're going to either not make it all the way, or win very few of them. That is, either you whiff, or you fail the mission entirely. <br/>\n<br/>\nSounds a tad "deprotagonizing." But, again, I don't know the context. Might be perfect for what you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf, however, you had some sort of redraw mechanic that did not require the use of Resolve, this would fix a lot of problems (escalate to one level higher to redraw?) That is, the odds of victory over time would go way up, and their lifespan would increase at the same time. Might require rebalancing the points to ensure that an optimal strategy wouldn't emerge from the three options given, sure. But it might be worth looking into. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe something to do with suit color matching? If you draw a card of the same color as your approach, but not your approach, draw again? That sort of thing. Probably lots of ways you could do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep this in mind... the contests that limit you to not using one approach limit the Three Approach character much more severely than the one approach character. Three times as much. So having that around means that the actual average over time of success is only 66% or so. The most talented character still loses one third of the time. And the least talented (one approach) loses approaching 80% of the time. You don't need something to mitigate that? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Guy, I'm not seeing at all what you are saying. Think of each redraw as a new contest... it is essentially. So the choice to redraw has no effect on the percentages of success. It only limits the actual number of contests addressed before running out of resolve. But that's true no matter which option you take. Each time a player chooses to re-draw, he's doing so understanding that he's potentially shortening his adventure. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo players who have only one approach will tend to re-draw less, sure. But it really all depends on what this current failure means, right? If death is on the line, you'll roll until you win or die. No matter the odds. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131629/#Comment_131629" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T09:49:34+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  9:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, not to be a bitch about it, but there's a possibly-significant element of the rules that is not stated: do you reshuffle the whole deck every draw, or every challenge, or only when the draw pile is empty? If not every draw, then you have diminishing odds each draw--fairly significant, it would seem, particular in the reshuffle only when empty case.<br/><br/>Also, what's the average number of players; or is the math agnostic to that? That is to say, wouldn't the number of total successes on average be for each individual player/character? So a group of, say, six should actually face ~18 challenges, presuming an even divide--that seems about right in terms of "one module" of play, to me. Obviously, this is conflict resolution, not task (in which case 18 challenges might only be a couple of encounters!).<br/><br/>Still... it's kind of cool. Do you intend to use the value of the card in some manner? Oooo! What about using an Uno deck, with its Wild cards and Pick 2 (draw two, if either is success, the challenge is a success--free Resolve point, basically) and such? That would definitely put some wiggles in the success probability!<br/><br/>Fun stuff to ponder!<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131639/#Comment_131639" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T10:35:41+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 10:35AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, say you have 75% of winning, if you redraw, the chances of you failing is not 0.25 twice, it's 0.25*0.25, we don't look at it as seperate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131641/#Comment_131641" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T10:39:44+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 10:39AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again, guys.  This is really helpful.  David, there will be exactly one player, and one stack of cards you draw from, and a discard pile.  So no re-drawing the same cards.  <br/><br/>Mike, 2-3 successes is on the lean side for what I'm after, but that's OK.  I'll just make sure failures are also interesting.  In fact, I think failure will be tasty because losing a point of Resolve will have some fun side effect:\n<blockquote>Before play, take one card for each point of Resolve and put them aside face down.  When you lose a point of Resolve, reveal one card, consult the <i>Table of Awesome</i>, find your card, and do what it says.</blockquote>\nI would like conditional change to be possible - something to increase/refresh Resolve, or the temporary addition or subtraction of an Approach, for example.  Nothing that breaks the game long-term, but breaking it for a single challenge (as the addition of an approach would to a 3-approach hero) is probably OK.  Within the very tight constraints imposed here, some things I can think of:\n<blockquote><br/>*Extra card draws - draw two instead of one, take best/worst<br/>*Ignore a failure (same as above, ultimately)<br/>*Increase/decrease Resolve<br/>*Add/remove an Approach for the next challenge<br/>*Draw a card as a "back up", reveal it whenever you like in a failed challenge<br/></blockquote>\nOthers?

This would be a balancing mechanic, since if you've been winning a heck of a lot of challenges, you'll want to reshuffle to get those winning cards back into the mix.  If you've been losing, you won't need to reshuffle, because all the good stuff is still to come.  It makes it a little "cheaper" to fail.
