If you get a moment, would someone look through them, and see if they make sense? What I want to know, specifically, is:<br/><br/>1. Could you run the game, given these rules? If not, what else would you need, or what should I change?<br/>2. Is there anything you don't understand?<br/>3. Can you see any obvious flaws in the rules? I think it's all ironed out, but if you see anything, tell me.<br/><br/>Any help much appreciated. I'll do the same for you sometime.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63007/#Comment_63007" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T21:47:06+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  9:47PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2007 9:49PM by markv.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham- I could play and understand 90% but I'm not sure 1. what happens after you get over your baggage, 2. if skills are used at total discretion of active player, 3. whether rallying cries are practiced before game, and 4. does first player out end game- see below<br/><br/>Set up<br/>1. Rallying cries? \xe2\u20ac\u201c reference that they are on character sheets for someone like me who was checking out the rules first<br/>2. Good advice on sex scenes<br/>6. Maybe more examples of guard and straight stereotypes. For the guards are they all supposed to be dominant, muscle bound, tom of finland types or any attractive gay type. Also, by \xe2\u20ac\u02dcweaker\xe2\u20ac\u2122 do you mean something like less macho than the guards or non alpha male or non-desirable?<br/>7. When you mention screw slips into balls I thought at first you meant put them into some kind of hollow screw-top sphere, like plastic easter eggs. Is this total innuendo or does screw mean crumple or twist in british English?<br/>9. just remaining baggage cards or all cards- kiss, baggage, ex- from reading on the latter is clear but you may want to say so<br/><br/>taking them down- <br/><br/>it took me time to figure out if the cards played by other players have any mechanical significance beyond approval for the main player \xe2\u20ac\u201c and what happens to those cards. Stress that they are only putting a card forward as a signal of approval and that the value/type of card won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be turned over/won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t matter.<br/><br/>Why do you have two ways to end scene? Having all players play card seems stronger.  I guess active player can end it earlier if a player is being stubborn or if it feels right to call it but it still seems like fading a scene is the weaker way out.<br/><br/>Is it active player\xe2\u20ac\u2122s decision whether or not they used one of their player\xe2\u20ac\u2122s skills? Can any player nominate that they someone used a skill? Can other players veto it? <br/><br/>Turning more cards-<br/>Do players hear and practice each other\xe2\u20ac\u2122s rallying cried before the game?<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\u0153After Taking Them Down, the players deal any cards played (except for Baggage and The Ex) amongst them, putting them on the bottom of their piles.\xe2\u20ac\x9d \xe2\u20ac\u201c Does this refer just to the card played by the active player or also all face down card played as signs of approval? If the latter, are these cards turned over so you can see which are baggage and ex?<br/><br/>Baggage: <br/>I understand the first two points but can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t figure out the second two. Your third point makes it seem like it is advantageous to collect baggage- but if you can only get over it once, why does it matter whether you collect more than one? Does the fourth point mean that later baggage cards played from your main hand still mean defeat after you have gotten over your baggage?<br/><br/>Pink alert<br/><br/>4. does this mean that when the first squad member escapes, they win, and the game ends.  IF so, this would reward players who are cautious or play badly and then just escape quickly when their braver colleagues reach the target- maybe have some team goals or points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63013/#Comment_63013" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-05T05:40:22+00:00" title="April  5, 2007  5:40AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2007 5:41AM by Graham.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's superb, Mark, thank you very much.<br/><br/>As a sort of thank-you, I've been through <a href="http://www.game-chef.com/workshop/comments.php?DiscussionID=505&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">your Game Chef entry and asked some questions</a>.
