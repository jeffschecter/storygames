                    "Star*Drive" (yes the asterisk is part of the title -- sigh!) was a sci-fi setting for TSR's mid-90's science-fiction RPG Alternity, which I played for several years before discovering these here story games.  Star*Drive is a classic case of a setting with an interesting theme which was totally obscured by rules for Drowning and Falling in Spaaaace.  (Not literally.  But that design philosophy.)  I'm wondering what system would work best for it.<br/>
<br/>
Star*Drive is about the pro's and con's of Imperialism.  The setting is your pretty generic space opera--there were a bunch of big wars, but things have finally settled down thanks to the Space United Nations, which looks good on paper but is powerless in practice.  Now that the wars are over, they're making recontact with a region that became abandoned for 150 years, the Verge.  The setting is mostly about how the arrival of the Big Governments will affect the locals, who have had their ups and downs.<br/>
<br/>
* Tendril - Space Factories, about to be bought out by Arrivers<br/>
* Corrivale - Space Refugees, about to be repatriated to Arrivers<br/>
* Lucullus - Space Pirates, about to be reigned in by Arrivers<br/>
* Aegis - Space Switzerland, about to be co-opted by Arrivers<br/>
* Oberon - Space Gold Rush Town, about to be conquered by Arrivers<br/>
* Algemron - Space Civil War, about to be diplomatically settled by A.<br/>
* Hammer Star - Space Stalingrad, to be defended by Arrivers<br/>
<br/>
Would this work for Dogs in the Vineyard?  If I understand Dogs properly, the analogy would be a bunch of folks from the Territorial Authority riding in, and fixing the locals' problems, sometimes for the worse.  Which doesn't quite seem like Dogs.                </div>

                            Maybe think of it as Dogs but where some Faithful communities have been separated from the rest for quite a while and these will be the first Dogs they've seen since the separation--lots of false doctrine and such to rein in I'd reckon. Of course, this presupposes that the PCs will be coming to the Verge as enforcers of Big Government ideology, something that may not be present in the setting.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd use Heroquest to run this game. Make up some keywords for the major factions and professions, emphasize relationships over the technology, and go to it.                        </div>

Man, I totally have a game you could use for this, especially if you factor in the Externals. It's unfortunately not done yet.<br/><br/>The thing about the New Arrivals is that they're a mixed bag, right? Do you want their help or not? Sometimes you do, but then maybe after you ask for it you'll have a new problem to deal with. That's something that few games have any good rules for. It's all eyeballin' it kind of stuff.                        </div>

                            Matt, are you talking about Galactic?  I kind of think Shock might work a little bit too - Social Issues being, like, "War, Reconstruction, Home Rule," and shocks being, like, "Galactic Civilization, Post-Apocalypse, Space Monsters."  (Maybe the social issues would fluctuate depending on what star system you visited.)<br/>
<br/>
I never found the Externals plot all that compelling, since (a) the aliens were sucky, and (b) it only served to emphasize that the Locals couldn't afford to completely brush off the Arrivers, or else the entire region would be conquered by Space Monsters.  The fact that the Star*Drive product line became obsessed with fighting utterly forgettable Space Monsters, rather than addressing the pretty interesting premise of the setting, is a prime case of System Does Matter.                        </div>

                            James, what kind of authority are you planning to set up the PCs with?  This will drastically affect the kind of game you're running -- the difference between <em>being</em> the space marines and being, say, the satellite office of a megacorporation from civilized space, is huge.                        </div>

                            Joshua - I kind of picture the players as traveling problem-solvers, either for the Arrivers or the Locals.  <br/>
<br/>
The core story from the setting book is pretty obviously, "Welcome to Planet X, where society revolves around Future Shock Y!  But Arriver Nation Z wants to change Y completely.  Supporting cast members A, B, and C all have something at stake here, and will take drastic action in support of their own agendas.  What do you intend to do about it?"<br/>
<br/>
...which only makes sense if the players have...<br/>
* Some authority on Planet X<br/>
* The ability to influence, but not dictate, the policies of Nation Z<br/>
* Vulnerability to the machinations of A, B, C<br/>
* (and maybe stuff I'm overlooking)<br/>
<br/>
The "campaign setting book" never spells this out in detail, which means that most of the players opt for the "a Rabbi, a Half-Elf Necromancer, and a Monkey meet in a bar" style of play, and just wander around doing whatever.<br/>
<br/>
However, it does make mention of a group of Dogs in the Space-yards who roam around fixing things in the name of the Space United Nations, which is pretty close to the aforementioned core story.                        </div>

                            My take on it says that you need to decide where the PCs will be coming from before you can meaningfully import to Dogs.  Where they come from will determine their authority, power, and influence (three different things), which should be the basis of a game surrounding the setup that you describe.                        </div>

Is your reading actually supported by the supplements, or are you not giving yourself enough credit for turning lead into gold?<br/>

                            Larry: "It's like Forgotten Realms, but SPACE OPERA!" has been my take on it for a good seven years now, and I only realized the setting's thematic content last Friday during an especially boring lecture.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, discovering it was an unpleasant surprise, since I've hated the setting for a long time, and it's a little embarassing to admit that (a) it's hard to find a theme more relevant to American foreign policy in the late 1990's, and (b) I'm an idiot for not noticing it for 7 years.<br/>
<br/>
To my credit, those themes are definitely there, but the campaign setting spends a heck of a lot of effort obscuring what you're supposed to do with it.  I think that you could rip out 80% of the book and not lose anything of value.<br/>
<br/>
PS.  It would actually be really cool to ditch the evil Space Monsters ("Externals"), and replace the threat as Space Al-Qaeda ("Insight" + their AI religion).  Or have the players be Space Al-Qaeda.  Either way.                        </div>

                            It's not in the book "for really real."  But looking back on it, it seems to be about that, more or less.  All of the Stellar Nations are absolutely asinine when understood on their own, but collectively they seem to be cariacatures of American society.  And then they roll up to a bunch of Third Worlders.  And sometimes it's a good thing that the Americans roll up, and sometimes it's a bad thing.  At least, that's my take on it from a very great distance.                        </div>

                            Hmm, that's cool.<br/>
<br/>
So what's the appealing part to you, that you'd like to bring to another system? Just the initial political setup? Basically, if you used it in another game, would you even have to make it Star*Drive, or would that end up being Star*Drive with the serial numbers filed off?<br/>
<br/>
Do you figure players for this would already be very familiar with the setting?<br/>
<br/>
If you want to use the setting more or less straight, I'm leaning towards HeroQuest.                        </div>
