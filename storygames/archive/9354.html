Do you talk more than the other players? Stand up? Take the seat at the end of the table? Say when the game starts? Say when the group will take a break? Obviously, we understand the ruleset gives you authority over certain things. In addition to that, what else do you do?<br/><br/>For example, I let people know when they can speak to me. It'll almost always be me who says "Dave, you haven't done anything for a while", not the players.<br/><br/>Note: if you think GMs shouldn't assert authority; or can't think of any ways you assert your authority as GM; or want to talk about how you behave as a player who isn't a GM: this is not the thread for you!

My players often bounce up as well, though, and sometimes are roleplaying from the kitchen as they get a drink, but I stay put.

It forms a major theme in <a href="http://knutepunkt.laiv.org/2009/book/FaceAndFigurationInRPGPlay/" rel="nofollow">the chapter I wrote</a> for the Knutepunkt book this year. There's a moment in this <i>Spirit of the Century</i> game I ran sometime last year where I'm trying to compel a player and it's just not working. There's a hiccup or glitch in play where the player doesn't understand how I'm contributing to the fiction or using the mechanics or something. And then something interesting happens: as I shift from the language of the fiction to a language of the game (from clouds to boxes, if you like), the players at the table contribute to this negotiation of both diegetic (i.e., fiction-producing) and game-mechanical authority. And the player comes back on board by taking ownership of the relevant Aspect and making a decision. It's really quite lovely.<br/><br/>The larger point, of course, is that the gaming table is the site of lots of interesting dynamics of interaction -- the flow of authority among them -- some of which are not immediately apparent or even readily available via introspection. So it's really fascinating to listen to people play and then go back and try to make sense of how and why particular events happened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207335/#Comment_207335" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T10:40:05+00:00" title="May 14, 2009 10:40AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great topic.<br/><br/>My group games primarily as a social event, so I never stop people from talking to each other, reading magazines, going on tangents, taking a break, etc. My job is to fit the game in between those things, which I do verbally.  Essentially I have no authority over the social space. That is not without major tradeoffs. Sometimes I and another person are ready to game and the others are still talking about some bullshit TV show they saw that we don't care about. With no authority, we have to just sit patiently until everyone is ready. And then maybe another side conversation has started and I have to wait some more.  However, granting someone, anyone, authority over that would be counterproductive to the group's overall goals.<br/><br/>Fitting in a game is interesting. I say "Are you all ready?" or something like that, and the answer is always "yes" even if two minutes later they're still talking and not ready to game at all.  Is that deference to authority or just being gentle with a friend who wants something? Or just annoying bullshit? Some combination?<br/><br/>Anyway, during the game I'm typically talking more than everyone else, and I try to present the fictional situations compellingly enough that people want to respond. In a way it's sort of literary bribery and browbeating that forms the basis for my in-game authority. That, and, you know, the fact that everyone came to play this game and the game says I have authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207339/#Comment_207339" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T10:41:38+00:00" title="May 14, 2009 10:41AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I shout at players.

First there's a lot of "Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay." looking at each player until I have everyone's attention, then I focus for a second, then - keeping a straight face is crucial here - I say "In A Wicked Age, at the height of summer, the whole city of Attalan sweats in the heat.  The sun is bright and the air is humid, and the rainy season is more than a month away.  A severe priest, Gulden (PC 1), walks down the road from the gates, looks up, and sees the head guardsman of House Kaopo (PC 2) staring down at him from the guard tower."  <br/><br/>By this point no one is talking, all the players are actively paying attention to what I'm saying, but no one feels like it's OK to speak.  So I change my tone of voice and look right at either player 1 or player 2, and I say: "What do you do?"  <br/><br/>From then on, I don't own the airwaves.

I don't do all of these all the time, and depending on how established the group and the game is I may do none of them in any given game. But at different times, with different players, I've done all of the following: <br/><br/>1) I do decide when game starts, and usually am the one who makes that call. Most of our games these days have theme songs, and most of them start with the playing of that song. I'm the one who starts the song playing after telling everyone else to shut the fuck up. I also usually have final call about when game ends, but that's a much softer and more negotiable thing. <br/><br/>2) I heavily facilitate any kind of "what happened last week" round up. While the ball will usually get passed around the table while we try to remember which bits of what we cared about, I have a heavy hand in introducing and maintaining threads of narrative across weeks. <br/><br/>3) As with Roger, I push hard to focus conflicts around specific areas. Often this is because the group has a generic conflict approach pattern that I'm trying to shove into form with whatever game we're actually playing at the moment. (Like getting folks to set proper and small stakes in Dogs, or not set stakes in IAWA, or whatever.) Because of this there is a lot of me in the way conflicts get resolved, even when I'm not directly involved (say PC vs PC conflicts). <br/><br/>4) I use eye contact, voice, and status presence to keep the game moving and everyone focused on the same things as well as to deal with OOC issues that arise. A lot of this is fairly subtle and hard to describe, but if you've had classroom management training you'd recognize it. As others said, it has to do with talking a lot, centering conversations, co-ordinating between others, and so forth.A big part of this is the coordination of others talking. My group are all overtalkers sometimes, and so I'm the one who breaks in and gets the overtalkers to listen to each other. I also often am the one who makes sure everyone had dice, sheets, paper, and pencils -- as any good teacher knows how to get activity materials to the class. <br/><br/>(Yes, the tie between GMing and teaching is a bit uncomfortable to me due to status issues between teacher/student and GM/player... but even when I don't do this hard core there does tend to be some level of it. It often happens when I'm not GM too, as its sort of an established social role.) <br/><br/>5) I used to host most games I ran. This isn't the case anymore, but when it was the effect of having the game in "my space" was pretty notable. No need to sit at the head of the table when you own the table, after all.<br/><br/>6) I almost always set the first scene, and use it to set tone. I also probably frame the slight majority of scenes in the game as a whole. This changes sharply from game to game, obviously, but in general the 52% default for scene framing is going to be mine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207395/#Comment_207395" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T13:48:36+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  1:48PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2009 3:08PM by Mule.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I start every game (other than the first, which is always rough) with waiting for the right moment (sometimes that's when people are talking, sometimes I'll wait; it depends on the group) raising my voice and saying, "Okay!  Last time, on <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dungeons and Dragons,</span></i> (or whatever game the group is playing)," and then giving a sentence or two recap of stuff that happened last time.  I'll look around for nods or puzzled faces to make sure everyone's on the same page, then set a scene.<br/><br/>You might be able to tell I love PTA.  In general, though, I use my authority to focus people by speaking just a little louder than normal with, "Okay!  So!".  Roger's example is pretty good.<br/><br/>Oh, also as GM I have authority to make funny voices and shush people who laugh.  Players who use funny voices for their characters have no shushing recourse to laughter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207403/#Comment_207403" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T14:18:07+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  2:18PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great topic. Jason and Brand covered my answer, so I'll just say yes to that as another data point.<br/><br/>I also use "Okay! So! Last time on, <i>Lady Blackbird</i>..." as the cue that we're switching from chatting to game time. But I'm kind of in JD's court as far as socializing-in-play goes. It's not a big deal if people want to joke about Futurama during the game (which happens in every session with my current group). I find that kind of thing can really help bond the players together socially and create a safer space, so to speak, for the game.<br/><br/>Oh, the other big authority thing for me as GM is in making sure no one gets talked over or sidelined. Some people have their interpersonal dynamics in place from outside of the game, where one defers to another or whatever. I don't let that happen too much at the table. If the quieter person starts talking and the louder person cuts them off, I'll step in and ask the loud person to hold off.<br/><br/>I especially hate it when one player decides that he gets to approve or deny everyone's contributions, saying stuff like, "But that doesn't make sense for your character," or "It would be a better story if..." as a means of bullying the table. I definitely use GM authority to crush that as soon as I see it. I try to support the player who is having their ideas shot down and quell too much nay-saying and negativity at the table. But I tend to not play with people like that anymore, so it's less of a thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207405/#Comment_207405" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T14:24:22+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  2:24PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When my players get off-track and a simple plea doesn't work, I reach for my cane.<br/><br/>I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>(It works around half the time.

I think, to me, however that it becomes an issue of "authority" not as "power" but as "granted right." Like, the President of the US has authority because he was elected, by the people and all that. He still has a job he has to do, and because he was elected he has to exercise the authority. (Which is, yes, a much more high handed and serious example than being a GM.)

I\u2019ve been doing it for some years now and I\u2019m the primary GM for the majority of my regular gaming, but it always puts me in the somewhat uncomfortable position of being in charge of my peers. Of course it\u2019s authority granted to me by them and it\u2019s only in the context of the game, but I find that along with all of the creative bits, the organization, the adjudication, and the rules reviews that I\u2019m perfectly happy to do, I\u2019m also expected to be Chief Cat Herder, and that is the role I least cherish. <br/><br/>It has a lot to do with my somewhat quiet nature \u2013 I am rarely the overtalker even though many of my players are. So when it\u2019s past time for the game to begin or a when a few comments become a group tangent, I have to, rather uncomfortably, politely interrupt and draw all eyes to me, meanwhile thinking, \u201cGeeze, this better be good\u201d in regards to whatever I\u2019m interrupting with. Of course they rarely care and are even waiting for this leadership, but I still feel slightly resentful because keeping things on track is in everyone\u2019s best interest and should be everyone\u2019s job. <br/><br/>Now, the majority of the people I regularly GM for have little or no GMing experience yet. When I have the pleasure of gaming with people who have GMed a lot, I find that keeping the game on track is a role more equally shared and I think that\u2019s because they understand and never fully shed the GM role. I know when I get to be the player, I happily help keep things focused and I think the difference is because I\u2019m not the only one.<br/><br/>As a side note, sometimes I find myself quite envious of guys with strong, deep voices. They control the conversation (for better or worse) with the least amount of effort. When I have to speak over the overtalkers, I try to remember to use a deeper voice and even body language, otherwise my voice gets more shrill and thus lost in the conversation.<br/><br/>-Rachel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207473/#Comment_207473" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T18:49:27+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  6:49PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2009 6:57PM by Eric.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>5) I used to host most games I ran.

Yeah, that's right, I said it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI literally outrank all of my players. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it would be poisonous in the extreme if I ever asserted that authority, both in the social space of gaming, and in the workspace, as that is explicitly forbidden by the creed and basic ethics. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know that it doesn't still have an effect. Even at the table, I'm not "Lance". They still call me Sergeant, as is proper. If this were a home game, and we weren't all sitting around in uniform, I'd probably insist on being called by my first name, as I like a strict demarcation between work and home, professional and personal. Here, I can't do that, though. There is no home or personal. <br/>\n<br/>\nI digress, but it's a thought-provoking thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nHistorically, I end up being the authority by being more focused on the activity of gaming than everyone else. Even when I'm not the GM, I usually end up being the guy who does the double-checks to make sure that people's schedules are still good in the days leading up to the game. When the BSing is cutting into the gaming time, I'm the guy who, one or another, brings it back on track. Sometimes I'll do this by saying "Anyway..." or "Let's get back to the game". Other times, I'll just frame or continue a scene or a conflict, hence bringing the participants in that scene or conflict back into the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also often, if not always, the systems-expert. I'm the guy who knows. Many times, I'm the guy who pitched the game. Even if I'm not the GM, I'm usually the other go-to guy for rules questions, because I tend to read up on the rules, even when other players don't. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm usually the host. Even when I'm not the host, I tend to take on some hostly responsibilities.. I bring drinks and snacks, largely for me, but open for sharing with whoever wants some. I help clear the playing before and after the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy and large though, I find that frequently, there is one player that is the social leader. They assert my authority by bowing to it, and others follow their lead. That's the case in the current group, that was the case in the groups back when I was just a joe. It wasn't really the case in the group I had with Alex, where I was the most forceful personality, but that was the exception, rather than the rule. I think it's this that has made it an assumption that the authority of the GM isn't a given or a right, it is, like all authority, granted by those you have authority over.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flip side, authority given but not accepted, taken, used, and owned isn't authority at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207535/#Comment_207535" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T03:07:36+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  3:07AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            weird...  I thought more people would  "start"  things as I tend to here at Story Games.  So far only a few have gotten close.<br/>But first...<br/><br/>Everything I need to know to GM with better authority, I learned from doing presentations at work and in school...<br/><br/>Authority or taking control or getting attention.<br/>I tend to be doing lots of last minute gathering of game-stuff materials before starting actual play.  So when I have all my books in place, the table set for play (minis or wipe board),  I have my drink, etc...  When I finally sit down at the table I've actually found that I've taken alot of ideas from how I've learned to do business presentations or classroom presentations and brought them into games.  NOT things that would make a game/fun group feel like you're at work or think  "hey, what is this a business meeting??"...  Less actual format type things and more the style and customer-friendly assertiveness.  Things like:<br/>-  speaking up<br/>-  sitting/standing up straighter<br/>-  snapping/tapping your papers on the table<br/>etc...<br/><br/>I have found that the expectation that you MAKE during the first few games with a group sets the tone to GIVE that authority easily.<br/><br/>I'm pretty strict on no allowing non-game stuff at the table.  If you want to look at a book, make it one of THIS game's books.  I also have a 42" TV right in front of the group when we game in my apt-living room...  But many of my game gangs have never seen the TV on.  In fact, I've had some be surprised at how "clear" the HD channels are, etc... when they finally sit down to watch a movie at my place - since they've never seen the TV on.  <br/>I turn off the TV before anyone arrives.  <br/>I never allow video games, etc... at the table.<br/>If you have a laptop, I don't allow it to be open/used unless you're using it for game  (some folks like typing notes as we play).<br/>No books or toys unless they directly relate to the game.<br/>I tend to suggest that the game table-area be CLEAR of food/drink packages.  Everyone uses my kitchen to put all food/drink, only getting what individual portion they want.  That keeps the scuffle of snack bags and clutter out of the way.<br/><br/>And I also LEAD BY EXAMPLE by turning off MY cell phone before game.<br/><br/>My game gangs and my play style tends toward  "immersive"  so once you establish this UP FRONT.  No one ever thinks twice.  <br/>I never have problems with any of the above distractions or lack of authority.  <br/><br/>Its all about setting expectations and 1st impression.<br/><br/>Another fun thing...  Simply endeavor to make the game FUN to be  "in-character"  and the players will role-play and stay in-character even if the GM is not in the room.   EXAMPLE:  Many of my games and my general game style also includes allowing (encouraging) private "hallway conversations", where myself and one or more players step aside to talk about game stuff or so mini-scenes role-playing or go over  "spot" or "sense motive"  type information that's PRIVATE or only that PC rolls well enough to get.  <br/>I'm okay with playing games that have all the info open to everyone - with appropriate people "firewalling" what their PC wouldn't know.  But most of my games tend to want that private discussion and many of the players I game with rather enjoy NOT knowing so they don't have to firewall.  My unspoken rule with these "wallway conversations" is that no one player will get anymore than 5 minutes (10 minutes at the absolute max) of private time.  Each other player KNOWS they'll get similar time as warrented, so no one feels left out.  Also - I do my best to leave the OTHER players something to discuss about the game as I'm off in the private conversation.  Either a point to consider with other players,  something to consider about what the next "scene" will be,  planning questions or actions,  or role-playing in-character while I'm away.  Almost like giving them a topic for talking point as I leave.<br/><br/><br/>-to be continued-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207536/#Comment_207536" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T03:08:11+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  3:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay...<br/>Now.  Two big things I tend to do for starting games and getting player attention.<br/><br/>FIRST -  sometimes games can get loud and chaotic due to the excitement of many people wanting to talk and talking over one another.  I learned along time ago that you (as GM) need to be a little more agressive about quieting the group.  If you don't those people that either are:<br/>a.  naturally quiet and won't speak up<br/>b.  get frustrated but hold it in and won't speak up when people speak over them<br/>Those people WILL get ignored.  <br/>So, to combat this I tend to literally say.....<br/>"ME - EVERYONE LISTEN TO ME!!"  following by saying something like  "because I have a huge ego..."  just to lighten the mood from shutting everyone up but not being a jerk and saying "SHUT UP!!"....  If you do it in a fun way and move directly to the point  (allowing each person to talk but IN TURNS)  everyone will understand and appreciate it.<br/>The second part of this is that I when the chaos happens, especially if action or combat is about to happen I simply call for INITIATIVE.  Get it on my big Initiative Wipe-Board and go in order.  Even if there's NO combat/action - this can help organize the chaos.  I also try to allow the player that WANTED to do something (that started the chaos) get a chance to START a "surprise round"  to allow them to go first since they asked first - even if their initiative was lower.  Many games have some sort of Initiative system and/or surprise round type order of Initiative to use -  but if not simply rolling a die or comparing dexterity, etc... works.<br/><br/>SECOND -  this is the bit I'm surprised no one else has said they do...<br/>Starting a game session.<br/>Ever since reading the D6 Star Wars RPG, I took and expanded on the idea of opening EVERY game I run with an "opening read".  Here's what I do for each and every game session and campaign I run - no matter how short.<br/>-  pick a theme music song for the campaign  (usually a cool/fitting piece from a soundtrack)<br/>-  I literally put the  "THX theme"  or the  "Newman theme"  (the drum roll before Star Wars)  before the campaign theme to play<br/>-  I get everyone's attention simply by hitting play on the opening theme,  sometimes I do this even when the players are in mind conversation (if I feel we need to get the game rolling).<br/>-  Turning the volume up to shut everyone up with the  THX/Newman  that says to them  "the movie's starting"  <br/>-  Then BAM, the campaign theme  (that begins EVERY session,  just like a weekly TV show)<br/>-  as the theme kicks in,  I slowly turn the volume down and read an opening.  Think of the opening to Buffy the Vampire Slayer  "To each generation a slayer is born..."  I make up an opening for EACH campaign, rarely changing it  (unless its for impact).  Sometimes its a simple read to inspire the campaign style,  other times it's a famous quote,  a rhyme,  etc...  always the same.  These are the campaign's "CREDITS".<br/>-  After the credits,  1 of every 3 sessions I'll ask the players to describe their  character...  many times asking them to "frame" the description in theme with our campaign.  If it's a super hero movie - describe it as opening the comic book and seeing the first panel of your hero.  If it's a movie - think of it in cinematic terms:  bird's eye views,  cross-cuts,  camera zooms on your characters face,  worm's eye view of your character's boots clacking on the ship decks,  etc... etc...<br/>-  sometimes I'll open (after the credits)  with a flashback scene,  or a cut-away to another part of the world or to the villain or plot point for the "audience" (that the players firewall),  or a simple "last time on..." as some folks have noted.<br/><br/>As with the "hallway conversations"  I try to make these session intros not TOO long, before actually getting IN the game scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I have lots of other minor tricks I tend to do... clacking my dice tin down on the table,  simply waiting for the (natural) uncomfortable silence that happens when you sit up and look at everyone quietly....  <br/>But overall -  its all about 1st impressions.  Set parameters.  Establishing your style and the expectations for what's acceptable at the table.  <br/>Doing it all in a friendly style UP FRONT.<br/><br/><br/>I've seen a few people try to use my opening credits music to run games after seeing me do it.  And in more than one case those GMs have either gotten embarrassed by feeling "cheesey"  or  feeling like it was unnecessary or that the players thought it was dumb....<br/>Me...<br/>I ham it up!<br/>Because in a way doing these things are how I get MYSELF pumped up to play.  I've learned from doing work presentations in front of 500-1000 people not to be nervous or be effected by people who might think it's silly or unnecessary...  I just do it.  <br/>The funny bit is that once you set the expectation even those players MISS if you don't do it.  <br/>I'll never forget a campaign I was running.  A player wanted to run a short-shot story and let me play.  When that player started the game and DIDN'T read the opening credits, etc... the player that originally made fun of me, spoke up and said  "what the hell?  where's the theme music?  We can't start yet!"  <br/>And with multiple of my other campaigns - players can't here the THX theme or the specific theme music without quoting my opening read!<br/><br/><br/>In the end you don't have to assert your authority as a GM if you set expectations with a STRONG first impression and don't be discouraged if/when some player makes fun of something you try to do to ADD to the style of the campaign.  Generally the only reason those people make fun is because they're uncomfortable "for you"...  Something they'd be embarrassed to do - so they can't watch someone else do it.<br/><br/><br/>Everything I need to know to GM with better authority, I learned from doing presentations at work and in school... heheh...<br/>thoughts?<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207540/#Comment_207540" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T04:13:04+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  4:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hand out XP on a punctuated yet unpredictable schedule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207559/#Comment_207559" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T07:13:39+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  7:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I did while running a OD&amp;D game last weekend:<br/><br/>"Ok guys - this is a pressure situation: the bad guys are fast approaching - you've got five minutes to plan your ambush and then we're going with what you've got."

I think one issue I have with answering the premise is that I've been doing it so very, very long. Someone mentioned the idea of GM as rank, and not just a role, and I think that's very true in all my established play groups -- even when I'm "just a player" I tend to be the spotlight whore, and the other players tend to defer to that. If I find myself playing with another spotlight whore (another play group's alpha dog) we quickly work out whether we're going to support each others' whorish behavior -- awesome -- or grind up against each other's ego -- not so awesome.<br/><br/>So last night I had to assert my authority. For realz! We were playing Agon. Eric had just positioned his dude, and Jason said "You know what? Hold up, I'm calling in an oath. Move me instead." Eric goes "What? No! I've already moved!" Jason: "Dude. Oath!" And back and forth for a few seconds, which I allowed to spool out 'til I saw they weren't going to see eye-to-eye. Then I asserted: "Okay, stop. None of that. There's no timing issue here. Eric, he's using his Oath. Let's move on." And that was that.<br/><br/>A slightly raised voice, directed at "the table" rather than one or the other of the players. I reached onto the table and forcibly put the pieces where they belonged. It was the first time in a long time that I've had to. Maybe. Shit. I probably do it all the goddamned time but now this thread's got my mind on it, so the event probably stood out for me.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207591/#Comment_207591" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T09:56:41+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  9:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's only strange to you because you're a civilian, I bet.

As I'm almost always the GM, on the rare occasions that I'm not, I end up being the "star player" (which I think is a better term than Spotlight Whore) most of the time. I've had to make a concerted effort to sit back and let other people make decisions and take the lead at times, and I've noticed that when I do that, it causes the game to stall out for a bit until people realize I'm not going to jump back in and take the reins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
