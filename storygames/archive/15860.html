Fifty feet of scaled terror glared down at us with smoldering red eyes. Tendrils of smoke drifted out from between fangs larger than daggers. The dragon blocked the only exit from the cave.<br/><br/>Sometimes I forget that D&amp;D\xae Fantasy Adventure Game is a game and not a novel I'm reading or a movie I'm watching. The original D&amp;D rules are a classic. They gave the first gaming system for fantasy role playing and, in my opinion, are still the best set of rules on the market. When I revised the rules I tried to maintain the spirit of the earlier rules.<br/><br/>Those rules were written for people with a background of gaming experience. This revision was designed to be easily read and used by individuals who have never before played a role playing game.<br/><br/>In the half\xb7dozen years since the original rules were published, the TSR staff has answered thousands of rule's questions. The answers helped find problem areas in those rules, areas which could either stand minor improvements or were difficult for novice garners to understand. This revision was aided not only by the collected gaming experience of TSR personnel but by the gaming experience of the thousands of players and DMs who sent us letters in the mail.</blockquote>\n<b>D&amp;D Basic Rules (Elmore Art), edited by Frank Mentzer, 1983:</b>\n<blockquote>Dedication<br/><br/>This game has undergone a startling metamorphosis from its earliest forms, written for hobbyists, to the current revision, usable and understandable by nearly anyone. The original flavor and intent has been carefully preserved. With the greatest admiration, respect, and thanks, this edition is dedicated to the president and founder of TSR Hobbies: E. GARY GYGAX.</blockquote>\n<br/>Do we need modern day versions of Tom Moldvay &amp; Frank Mentzer to do the same for popular Indie Games? <br/><br/>In some ways, early D&amp;D was quite similar to modern day indie games. I wonder if they could use the same solutions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360157/#Comment_360157" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T06:06:42+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  6:06AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey John!<br/><br/>How about <a href="http://playsorcerer.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://playsorcerer.wordpress.com/</a><br/><br/>Would that fit the bill?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360162/#Comment_360162" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T06:31:10+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  6:31AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always wondered if the reduced uptake of RPGs wasn't partially due to shift away from beginner-oriented boxed sets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360164/#Comment_360164" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T06:37:32+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  6:37AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex F</cite>Hey John!<br/><br/>How about <a href="http://playsorcerer.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://playsorcerer.wordpress.com/</a><br/><br/>Would that fit the bill?</blockquote>\nYes!

When I was doing the afterschool class with Tavis, the children <i>ate this stuff up with a spoon</i>.  They literally could not get enough of collaborative wish-fulfillment and challenge-overcoming.  They talked about their characters all the time, told each other stories about the world, and a few of them got so pumped up they ran the game on their own even though we hadn't given them any rules with which to do so.  There is a huge unmet need for social, structured, imaginative play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difficulty from a Forge-ite's standpoint is that these kids have about 10 seconds worth of attention.  They are not going to read a rule book that is 20 pages long.  They will not read a rule book that is 5 pages long.  (We got D&amp;D; down to a single double-sided page and it was too long.)  So spending all your time on clever design might get you status among designers, but it means shit for the actual audience (kids, or more meaningfully, their parents).  If you absolutely have to have a rule book, it's gotta be something like the monster manual with crazy-cool pictures of monsters and treasures on every page, so that a kid will want to study it lovingly even if he or she has no idea what it means.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the main thing is marketing and outreach and figuring out a way to crack the market to begin with, rather than coming up with some brand-new crazy design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360199/#Comment_360199" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T09:51:21+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  9:51AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post James!<br><br>We also know people who know the people in charge of deciding what games are featured in B&amp;N: <br><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15690" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15690</a><br><br/>It also appears that strategy games are the big sellers for B&amp;N.

We're looking at "structured" at the level of "you take turns and when you agree that something will happen if you roll the dice, you have to accept the result of the dice roll."<br/><br/>In my experience the afterschool kids have the most fun when they're making the rules up as they go along. It's not just that the barriers to entry have been removed; it's that they have lots of experience playing professionally well-designed pre-programmed games, so the wahoo thrill for them is getting to be game designers and not being limited by anything except consensus and the boundaries of their imagination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360239/#Comment_360239" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T11:59:24+00:00" title="February 17, 2012 11:59AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite><br/>The difficulty from a Forge-ite's standpoint is that these kids have about 10 seconds worth of attention.

It was Patient Zero to my crew.  No one taught us how to play.  We forged our own local tradition from those rules.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Do we need modern day versions of Tom Moldvay &amp; Frank Mentzer to do the same for popular Indie Games?</blockquote>\nI believe that we have some wonderful instructional texts today -- Fiasco and Microscope are my oft-quoted examples.  They are very clear about the kind of play they want to create, and offer brief, clear, and exacting procedures for how to achieve that.  Fiasco is stylish and seductive, too, just like the old box sets.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I think there are some indie games that could certainly benefit from a redboxing.  In A Wicked Age was a very tough read for me, but fell together almost instantly once someone taught it to me.  I'd love to see a more accessible version of that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360312/#Comment_360312" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T16:03:08+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  4:03PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Do we need modern day versions of Tom Moldvay &amp; Frank Mentzer to do the same for popular Indie Games?</blockquote>Eero's<i>Solar System</i>?<br/>I really dig Solar System, but I wonder what a 12 year old kid would make out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360317/#Comment_360317" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T16:59:57+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  4:59PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>Would they read a rulebook that is...<a href="http://celstyle.com/?p=346" rel="nofollow">a comic</a>?</blockquote>\nI see your rulebook that is a comic and raise you <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/ebook/the-supercrew/17491538" rel="nofollow">a rulebook that is a comic</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
