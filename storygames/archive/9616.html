As you correctly point out, all the "rim" rules are by definition optional, and you can run a fully functional BW game using nothing but Versus tests. On the other side are little plug-ins like the "Oh Shit!" rule, which is included as a Fight! option for scripting noobs and is intended to be discarded with more experience.<br/><br/>I can't think of any other games that do that -- offer up-front options that are meant to be removed with more experience -- but I'm sure I'd come up with some with a little thought. Sure seems like a good idea, truth be told, when the core game is especially tricky and players have a hard time making informed play decisions.<br/></blockquote>\nLike Paul, I can't think of any other games that do this. <br/><br/>Burning Wheel is somewhat vexing to me, since I like a lot about it, but have never managed to have a really awesome game with it. That said, I don't know that I've actually used the "training wheel" rules. Perhaps my nerd-pride forbids me.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any examples of rules like this? Did they work well?

I know in Deadlands and I think Shadowrun, the template characters were markedly sub-optimal -- if you played with one of them, your character would have a hard time and fail a lot.<br/><br/>When I played AD&amp;D, our group would suggest that new players play Fighters and maybe Rogues, since those classes have the fewest special features. After they got comfortable with the rules, they could try a spellcaster of some sort.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, you could consider the level system of D&amp;D to be a series of training wheels. 1st level characters have few powers and options in combat. So play is straightforward. Each level, you add one or two more things for the players to consider, and they have plenty of time to learn and become proficient with their new options before the the next level.<br/><br/>At some point Vincent posted some <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26103.0" rel="nofollow">optional rules restrictions</a> for In A Wicked Age to help people break bad habits from other games that made IAWA play not as fun.

In both\u2014and really, any time you become fluent at something\u2014you start with a very simple task, do it until you can do it fluently, and then add one more thing. It also relates a lot to Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1ly's concept of "Flow." You're always in that narrow corridor of challenge and skill, between too little challenge (boredom) and too much (frustration).<br/><br/>We also discuss how you could build up comfortably to even a very complex game by doing this. After all, we do this with language. The "Where Are Your Keys?" game differentiates between the "Barney" level of fluency (fluent at the level of single words), the "Sesame Street" level of fluency (fluent at the level of simple sentences), the "Larry King" level of fluency (fluent at the level of paragraphs), and the "Charlie Rose" level of fluency (fluent at the level of abstract or philosophical discussions). Notice, Charlie Rose still uses good old Anglo-Saxon words, too. He doesn't lose that previous level of fluency; in fact, the more complex levels build on that.<br/><br/>So, from that perspective, "training wheels" seem like an admission of failure. Really, I think you want a system that has a number of simple additions. It works at each level, and progressing from one level to the next doesn't present an overwhelming challenge. By the same token, you build on earlier levels. If you throw away an earlier level once you've outgrown it, I think that might show you that one level has too much complexity in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213775/#Comment_213775" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T18:49:58+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  6:49PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Selene Tan \u2014 that's a *great* point about D&amp;D play.

I tell people the same three initial actions (which I call now "The Script"), and that teaches the game fairly well -- removing some options that don't make sense without context, and directing you to choices that are fairly optimal for the first time player. The key to making it work, I think, is that the GM also has to follow the script -- no cheating in order to take advantage of people.<br/><br/>This week, my goal is to turn that into a one-page hand-out (without the awesome layout-fu that Fred used on the character sheet, since, you know, baby <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> so that I have it in time for GPNW. I may post it up on the net afterward, if it ends up working out as a handout rather than just my verbal directions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213902/#Comment_213902" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-22T12:02:29+00:00" title="June 22, 2009 12:02PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spirit of the Century has a "spend a Fate Point to get +1 to your roll" rule that almost always withers away once people get into tagging Aspects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214220/#Comment_214220" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T13:19:36+00:00" title="June 24, 2009  1:19PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite>The important thing about training wheels is that once you achieve basic mastery, you take them off and never use them again.</blockquote>I totally agree; that's this thread's core focus. And so Bloody Versus fails by that definition--sure, you might use it early on or for a demo game; later you might love Fight! and leave Bloody versus aside; but eventually you'll use it for some lame-ass mook fight that you accidentally threw at the PCs while distracted or tired (if one holds the opinion that one shouldn't have "mook fights" that don't hit BITs).<br/><br/>But the 4d6-keep-3 D&amp;D optional rule would qualify, if one takes the stance that eventual "mastery" of the D&amp;D game involves rolling up a 3d6 guys and stepping up to what it gives you. (Thought provoking aside: Would it be equally "hard core" to points build with 63 points [3.5 die average * 3 dice * 6 stats]? Or is the chance of having to play with a stat total less than the average is part of the "burn?")\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite>Yes, rules specifically intended to be used only for a couple games and then not used any longer.</blockquote>Some clarification might be necessary: I meant, literally, rules that let you undo or takeback an action, not rules that you would undo-as-in-stop-using.<br/><br/>So I'm saying that a LOT of "training wheels" in games (not even just RPGs) involve letting someone take back an action which is utterly, clearly suboptimal and (presumably) unfun. For instance, "jeopardy" calls in chess and "check" calls in speed chess - warns the beginner of something that he or she might not notice. Huh... wait, that ISN'T an undo so much as it's a preemptive action by the opposition to help avoid a future bad action.<br/><br/>So that could be a sort of training wheel rule that isn't based upon an undo, but upon a warning. Going back to BW, it would be like pointing out that a Spider has you at Close: Lock is damned-near inevitable, at that point, and the newbie can look for Lock's counter right on the cheat sheet.<br/><br/>OO! Cheat sheets! Any game of tactics which provides a chart of some kind to compare and contrast tactical options. The "master" BW player won't need the chart because he'll have memorized the maneuvers and gained a fell of the ebb and flow of Fight that doesn't require pouring over the comparison charts looking for maneuvers. Or, to get simpler, the cards they give you at some casino's for when to hit or stand or split, based on what you have and what the dealer is showing--a card counter doesn't need that in the slightest, and even passable blackjack players don't bother with one (having it memorized or even having a sort of "weak counting" subconscious process).<br/><br/>I reckon I think finding the categories of training wheels to be more interesting, as they can be more helpful to designers/writers than some examples. But keep either kind coming: I can extrapolate a category from an actual example (and, as above, might even stumble into new categories as I do so!).<br/><br/>Cool thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214224/#Comment_214224" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T13:37:16+00:00" title="June 24, 2009  1:37PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blood Red Sands sets stakes in a competive backwards poker fashion where I tell you what you're going to bid and you tell me what I'm going bid.

Something like an "undo" rule, but with granularity (you can undo some or all; non-binary). Also a bit like a warning rule.

To me, these examples are really true "training wheel" rules -- rules that the game designer specifically intended to make life easier for new player, but that are genuinely different from other game rules, and intended to be used less and less or discarded.<br><br>I think it's important that the game text SAY this, though. "Here's a rule you can use to make things easier at first, although you'll probably want to stop using it when you're more familiar with the game".<br><br/>I'm pretty sure Spirit of the Century does specifically say this in the text. Ralph, when this rule is presented in Blood Red Sands, does the text indicate that this is a rule that players are likely to find less useful as their game-fu grows?                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
