Which didn't make the crowd happy. There was a strong Pathfinder vibe representing! People were much more interested in the $5 blow up D20 balloon than anything to do with D&amp;D 4E, even though they could make a profit selling the books on Ebay. It was simultaneously hilarious and completely caught me off guard. <br/><br/>One thing about the show that I found endearing, everyone involved from the performers to the host to the announcer were much more tabletop RPG nerds than RPG video gamers. They included a few video game references to have a wider appeal but it was hilarious to be in a situation where video games were more alien than D&amp;D. Their next show is going to be boardgame themed!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317866/#Comment_317866" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-26T10:34:50+00:00" title="March 26, 2011 10:34AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unrelated but another strange event from last night...<br/><br/>Red Bull has a marketing team of women who drive around in a Red Bull car and costumes scouring the internet for events to market Red Bull to.

There was always tension between the story / talking in character / drama gamers and the tactical / minis / minmaxing / combat all the time gamers. But even though it was bumpy, we all tried to get along. But when D&amp;D 4E came out, it said, the way the tactical / minis / minmaxing / combat all the time gamers play D&amp;D is now the official way to play. And many gaming groups broke apart because people stopped being flexible and started saying, "there is only one way to play."</i><br/><br/>That said, they like many small hyper focused indie games even though they said they aren't presented as toolkits because it is a smaller investment. You can learn the rules in a day and play just a hand full of sessions. They are great to play in-between playing other games. And in the short term, focus was better because it meant faster play. But for longer term games, they wanted more flexibility. Especially because in longer term games they couldn't guarantee who was going to be around to play and what their play style is.<br/><br/>I'm not saying I agree with the above but just wanted to note how many different people were saying the same things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317874/#Comment_317874" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-26T12:05:56+00:00" title="March 26, 2011 12:05PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2011 12:07PM by JDCorley.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/macro/thusiwin.jpg"/><br/><br/>Just kidding. Sounds pretty cool. That's hilarious about the Red Bull people. I like it.  The boo-ing is crass. I frown in its direction. Edition wars aside, can you find someone who will enjoy those things? Of course you can.
