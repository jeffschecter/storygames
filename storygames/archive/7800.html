I struggle a lot with the issue of legacy.  If I could bottle every important experience I've ever had and distribute it to others I would.<br/><br/>One of those experiences was discovering The Forge.  I am still in this hobby because of the ideas developed at The Forge.  I would not be, otherwise.  But it did a lot more than enable my continued participation in this "fringe" insignificant hobby.  The concepts developed there trickled out into other aspects my life.  At the time of encountering The Forge I pretty much hated fiction.  The concepts at The Forge completely defined my view of fiction such that I could love it again.  Sorcerer in particularly redefined my concepts of "fantasy fiction" and "hardboiled detective" novels.  By redefining my view of fiction and my relationship with fiction, over time I've had a rather fundamental shift in how I view humanity as a whole.  And of course any shift in your view on humanity is going to affect how you interact with the world in general.<br/><br/>So yes, encountering The Forge and the ideas there has had a pretty radical impact on my life beyond "gaming."  I'm a happier, more confident, more positive and more creative person because of it.  So, the idea that someone who was in a similar disgruntled, unhappy mindset as I was back then and DOESN"T find that experience, scares the shit out of me.  If I could bottle the experiences that lead to that paradigm shift and pass it out at conventions I would.  The closest I come to that is running the games I enjoy most in the manner I enjoy most at conventions so that I know there is always a place local to me where maybe that cynical gamer might stumble across my table, "looking for something different" and actually find it.<br/><br/>However, I also know there is no one thing that may inspire that light bulb.  I mean the initial light bulb for me actually went off when reading a game that had nothing to do with The Forge: Story Engine.  The way things were presented in that book really began the wheels turning in the right direction that lead to the insights necessary for me to play Sorcerer effective.  So I realize that in the absence of being able to bottle my experience I need access to as many different approaches as possible.  TSOY will speak to someone while Dirty Secrets will speak to someone else.<br/><br/>So when Matt says, "my stuff will no longer be available" all I can think of is the handful (and that's probably all it will be) of people for whom Dust Devils or Nine Worlds would have been *it*, the thing that spoke to them the way Story Engine &amp; Sorcerer spoke to me.  But because they got there too late it won't happen.  A handful of people who never get the jolt I did and continue down the path of cynical unhappiness or as Ron sometimes puts it, "fun someday."<br/><br/>Yes, I realize this is the "But think of the CHILDREN!" argument and that is rather flawed.  But it's still how I *feel*.  It's an emotional response, not necessarily a rational one.  I also believe it has some merit as an academic ethic.<br/><br/>So, you may now proceed to think I'm an angst ridden nut ball.  But thank you for listening.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172937/#Comment_172937" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T13:38:54+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  1:38PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>It sounds like you have a calling to grab up Dust Devils and Nine Worlds, put them into bags and run them at cons like a motherfucker on fire with the devil chasing ya.<br/><br/>Judd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172941/#Comment_172941" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T13:41:07+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  1:41PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>It sounds like you have a calling to grab up Dust Devils and Nine Worlds, put them into bags and run them at cons like a motherfucker on fire with the devil chasing ya.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, but then that limits their range to within 10 feet of me.

My issue applies to all of that.  I do not like the very idea that there are works of creative effort out there I can not access if I so choose or direct someone too if they're looking for something specifc.  I do not like the idea there are movies out there I can not find (anyone have Stephen Soderberg's Kafka?).  Books I can not locate (there is stuff Ron mentions in Sorcerer &amp; Sword I STILL can't find).  TV Shows yet to be released (it was YEARS after I first went looking for them that they FINALLY released the original Mission Impossible).<br/><br/>And no, I don't think there will always be "something to take their place."  I know of NOTHING in modern fantasy publishing that can hold a candle to Karl Wagner's Kane stories for example.<br/><br/>The concept of "out of print" is a source of nightmares for me.

And, I can't even imagine what you'd be doing right now if Ron was doing what I'm doing. It's also not really great that this thing that has you tied up emotionally wasn't even worth $24 to you. If you can't spend $24 (plus shipping maybe, so $30?) to help other people see things like you, then what IS it worth to you? Jesse = Nutball, Think of The Children! If it's so important, why the "Oh, I didn't around to it yet"? You can see how this is pretty insulting to me, right?

I've provided a link to Dust Devils.<br/><br/>If I owned your games and played them exclusively, I STILL wouldn't be able to do that under the current circumstances.  I learn about games that don't necessarily "speak" to me personally all the time and often recommend them to others who seem to be looking for something that aligns with what I've read.<br/><br/>There are things that speak to me.  There are things that don't speak to me.  But I know that what doesn't speak to me MIGHT speak to someone else.<br/><br/>This is so much bigger than your games specifically.  This is about everything that has been created EVER.  What difference does it make whether I own a copy of it or not.  I own copies of out of print stuff.  That doesn't exactly help me expose other people to it.  It's with me.  And they can't get it.<br/><br/>And as someone pointed out in the original thread immortality is now basically free (at least in printing) throw it up on lulu and make an odd buck now and then or provide a link on free blog site somewhere.  YOU never have to touch it ever, ever again if you don't want to.<br/><br/>But it will be there.  Waiting for those who it will touch.<br/><br/>Put another way: Even if the *game* isn't important to me.  It's *availability* is important to me.  Because that means people to whom it WILL be important (who perhaps don't know about it yet) will be able to get it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172998/#Comment_172998" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T15:12:51+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  3:12PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, stop defending yourself.

What is lacking when a text falls out of print is the thing itself, not comparable things, not things with the "new idea" at the text's core, not better things (or worse things), not related things, but the text itself, the work itself, the author's touch itself. <br/><br/>Nobody is saying out-of-print-ness of something cool doesn't suck - but the fact is that it doesn't pick your pocket, it doesn't impoverish you, it doesn't hurt you. All it does is fail to help you.  And everything you don't read fails to help you whether you could have read it or not. <br/><br/><i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> might help you a hundred times more than this Kane junk, but you haven't read that, have you? (Don't lie, nobody has read Martin Chuzzlewit.) Well, then, what benefit is it to you? Only through its influence, the other works it has spawned, pushed, pulled, inflamed, or sparked.  And if Martin Chuzzlewit was removed from the market by a righteous and merciful God, or zombie Charles Dicken's lawsuits, the influence would remain, the benefit to you would remain, you would not be injured.<br/><br/>In sum, "oh boo hoo hoo".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173011/#Comment_173011" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T15:44:09+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  3:44PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Legend has it J.D.

I have 9W and both Dust Devils and Dust Devils Revenged.  And I was waiting for 44.  Dust Devil was the first "forge" game I ever played (making a mess of it, but at the time I did know nothing...). I lately did a demo of Dust Devil revenged for the narrattiva crowd and a public demo at Mosquito Games 2008.<br/><br/>This net me enough "points" to go nutball now if I want?<br/><br/>I have looked at the Indie Press Revolution site, at the sales chard. Dust Devils Revenged, a western game (not really a big selling genre these days) is 16th. <br/><br/>this is the chart:<br/>1. \tSpirit of the Century<br/>2. \tDogs in the Vineyard<br/>3. \tSpirit of the Century [Print+PDF]<br/>4. \tHouses of the Blooded [PDF]<br/>5. \tPrimetime Adventures<br/>6. \tDon't Rest Your Head<br/>7. \tBurning Wheel: Revised<br/>8. \tPolaris<br/>9. \tTrail of Cthulhu<br/>10. \tShab-al-Hiri Roach [Book+Cards]<br/>11. \tREIGN [Softcover]<br/>12. \tAGON<br/>13.   Dictionary of Mu <br/>14.   DREAD<br/>15.   Shock 1.1: Social Science Fiction <br/>16    Dust Devils Revenged<br/><br/>If you take out Trail of Cthulhu, Reign, House of the Blooded (that I consider another category of games) and join both versions of Spirit of the Century,  Dust Devils Revenged is 12th.  <br/><br/>If you consider only games (not supplements) Dust Devils is 11th<br/>1. \tSpirit of the Century<br/>2. \tDogs in the Vineyard<br/>3. \tPrimetime Adventures<br/>4. \tDon't Rest Your Head<br/>5. \tBurning Wheel: Revised<br/>6. \tPolaris<br/>7. \tShab-al-Hiri Roach [Book+Cards]<br/>8. \tAGON<br/>9.     DREAD<br/>10.   Shock 1.1: Social Science Fiction <br/>11    Dust Devils Revenged<br/><br/>AFTER Dust Devil Revenges, the games that sell LESS at IPR are: Universalis, Sorcerer, The Shadow of Yesterday, The Mountain Witch, 3:16, Grey Ranks, Best friends, Mechaton, Inspectres, In a Wicked Age, Breaking the Ice, Mortal Coils, With Great Power, Capes, Dirty Secrets, the Comitee for the exploration of mysteries, Donjon, lacuna, Carry, Cat, Beast Hunters. And a lot more products.<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad showing. Not a bad showing at all. I don't know how much copies this means, and how much money this means, but I think that it would be really difficult to paint Dust Devil Revenged as a product with disappinting sales. Not without saying that at most, only 10 indie games didn't have disappointing sales, ever.<br/><br/>Was it the number of actual play report? Or the internet buzz? I don't know, but there are techniques to provoke them, and you didn't use them, as far as I can see. It could ever be said that you actively tried to disappear from view: you reduced your posting on The Forge a lot (15 posts in the last 6 months, every single one of them answering questions about your game - two from me - or for the organization of the booth at conventions) you put off-line your podcasts and magazines, you changed a lot of times your blog software removing all your previous blog posts.<br/><br/>In any case, a search for "Dust Devils" at the forge returns around 800 different threads names. The Chimera Creative forum had 1358 posts, the 8th in post numbers of the publishers subforums (after Adept Press, Lumpley Cames, CRN games, Universalis, the riddle of steel, Heroquest, Dog Eared Designs)<br/><br/>So, I don't know how high was the sales or buzz level that would have satisfied you. I don't even KNOW if sales and buzz are the real reason at all (but these are the things you cited here), and in the parent thread I have repeatedly said that you have any right to put all your games off-line, if you want. But saying that you were ignored by the buyers is not backed up by these numbers (I mean, if you don't think that every indie game has disappointing sales and no buzz), and it' rather uncalled for.<br/><br/>(In other words: ouch!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173031/#Comment_173031" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T16:36:34+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  4:36PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno, I'm squinting real hard and still not seeing what you are claiming I said.

Exactly.  Have you noticed that some people understand what I have to say about Sorcerer and don't understand what Ron says about Sorcerer?  I don't say anything about Sorcerer Ron doesn't ALSO say, but something about the way I say it enables people who otherwise don't understand Ron to "get it."<br/><br/>That's why I write my essays about Sorcerer.  So that when I'm dead and Ron's dead people who come across Sorcerer in it's archived format along with the then defunct Forge will STILL be able to read Ron's version vs. my version.  Because when I'm gone, there will be new people who will still find my way of discussing Sorcerer more understandable than Ron's.<br/><br/>And so it is with literature.  And movies.  And TV Shows.  Only more so.  There's life lessons in their and if we lose one we lose one way of sharing that and those who would have found it, who would have understood it (yes, I realize those are two different conditions), now won't.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173052/#Comment_173052" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T17:56:02+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  5:56PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'know folks, I know that there's this whole internet ethos of "All information must be available, freely, forever, because you <i>never know</i> when 1969's grain yield statistics for southeast Iowa might be the crucial element to ending world hunger," but ... well, two things.<br/>\n<br/>\n(a) The loss of some things (even cool things) and their replacement by new things (even things not as cool as the original) is not a Big Honkin' Deal.
