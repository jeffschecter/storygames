                    (An extension of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1232" rel="nofollow">The Verb</a>.)<br/><br/>I'm not so much of a theory guy and I'm not so good at da engalish. So maybe you guys can put into more eloquent terms what I'm trying to figure out here.<br/><br/>In an early draft of that "learn from each other and make each other awesome" game I'm working on, there was no mechanical conflict. Stuff happened, but there wasn't any real grist in the happening. I went back to the drawing board to figure out some conflict and I was linked to this post on the difference between <a href="http://gamingphilosopher.blogspot.com/2006/09/ideology-of-conflict.html" rel="nofollow">conflict and resistance.</a> It would seem that I was leaning towards resistance beyond conflict in that early draft, which may work better for my game. <br/><br/>So that got me thinking that maybe there was some cool little shortcut to designing the core of an RPG:<br/><br/><b>Step 1: Pick a Verb.</b><br/>Protagonists in your game will always be able to do this verb. They'll always <i>want</i> to do this verb. This provides a convenient thematic focus for your game. If your system and setting are not encouraging your chosen verb, you might be veering off-track a bit. The Verb is the cause of â€” and solution to â€” all problems.
<blockquote>Example: Revolt. Betray. Judge. Rock! Snap. Die. Risk. Help. Learn. Change. Seek. Connect. Improvise.</blockquote>
If you feel that your verb is getting too specific, which is not necessarily a bad thing, you can move it down to the next step and make it an adverb.<br/><br/><b>Step 2: Pick some adverbs.</b><br/>No one likes to be part of the crowd. Even though the game is entirely about this one verb, the average session would get kind of dull unless there was some variation on the theme. 
<blockquote>Mightily. Dextrously. Enduringly. Wisely. Intelligently. Charismatically. Stealthily. Craftily. Daringly.</blockquote>
In essence, these the "stats" of your game. While The Verb tells the group what players be doing during most parts of the game, the adverb tells the group what  <i>characters</i> will be doing.<br/><br/><b>Step 3: Resist the Verb. Offer adverb-oriented solutions.</b><br/>The mechanics should provide some resistance, but not be a complete obstacle, to players doing this Verb. Antagonists should be able to be thwarted by clever use of the Verb (which is why they want to stop the protagonist from doing the verb, after all.) One way to encourage players to face this resistance is by making it the only way to do their verb/adverb better.
<blockquote>Your game's verb is to <b>fight</b>. Let's say you've chosen a fantasy universe for your game. You're playing a fighter in a group of stock fantasy adventurers. Because you've chosen the Dark Elf race, you're saying you want to "fight <b>stealthily</b>." Because you've chosen the Warrior class, you're also saying you want to "fight <b>violently</b>."<br/><br/>The resistance you face, be it traps or monsters, should directly challenge your ability to fight. (The simplest method of resistance usually being "you can't fight if you're dead.") Your game should encourage adverb-oriented solutions to overcoming this resistance. This encouragement should probably take the form of an increased efficiency in using whatever adverb the player has used to overcome the resistance.<br/><br/>So your group has come across a whole army of ravenous orcs. While everyone else does their schtick, as defined by their chosen adverb, you sneak around a corner and dress up in the orcish armor. You wade into battle, blending in to the crowd, until you come to the orcish general commanding the armies from horseback. There, you steal the ceremonial sword from one of his officers and impale the general through the back.<br/><br/>If you're successful, you blend back into the crowd, leaving the general looking like he had just been killed by one of his own men, leading to dissension in the ranks and outright civil war. Thus, you have overcome the resistance by fighting, you have done so stealthily, and if the orc-on-orc carnage is any indication, you have done so violently. You will now get rewarded with an increased efficiency in fighting stealthily and violently in future occasions.</blockquote>
<b>Step 4: Adverb vs. Adverb.</b><br/>The previous example showed two adverbs working together harmoniously, but you may also wish to have mutually incompatible adverbs in your game as well. <br/><br/>If characters are working together, these adverbs can represent abilities that complement each other. Be sure to encourage both adverbs equally so that each character gets their turn to be awesome. <br/><br/>If characters are resisting each other, these can represent differing methods or philosophies. This can present some interesting character-driven drama, so if you want to go down that path, your mechanics should encourage these adverbs to resist each other.
<blockquote>Say you're playing a game about mutants who are ostracized from normal society. The verb of this game is to <b>overcome</b>.<br/><br/>Imagine there are two movements in this setting. One movement that says mutants should live harmoniously with humans. The other movement says that mutants should overthrow humanity and rule over them. These two movements can be said to have the adverbs: <i>harmoniously</i> and <i>aggressively</i>.<br/><br/>These two adverbs, being mutually incompatible, should come into conflict with each other. The average session will probably have these two adverbs, represented by the two mutant movements, directly competing with each other. A session or two could revolve around the two groups being forced to work together for a common goal. On a more personal scale, you could have stories about individual characters struggling with the choice of either of these two adverbs.</blockquote>
Odd numbers are always better for these kinds of things, but I couldn't think of a fifth step. What are your thoughts?                </div>

                            Wow! I have been working on something nearly identical to this idea. I've been calling it the <i>Grammar Engine</i> and I also include the use of Nouns in addition to verbs and adverbs.<br/><br/>Yet another example of not "striking while the iron is hot" causing me to shoot myself in the foot. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Daniel, this rocks awesomely and rocks wickedly.<br/><br/>I like that "die" is one of the sample verbs. That'd make for a wicked Samurai Honour kind of game.<br/>At any point, I can Die Pointlessly or Die Valiantly.<br/><br/>But... in the first example, you have people picking Adverbs individually (because I am dark elf, I pick stealthily).<br/>And... in the second example, it appears adverbs have been picked collectively (because we are all mutants, harmoniously and aggressively).<br/><br/>Did I misinterpret?<br/>Or... are there options about how verbs and adverbs are picked? (individually vs. collectively)<br/><br/>Suggestion:<br/>Have either the Verb or Adverb picked collectively.<br/>So in the first example, Verb is Fight, everyone adverbs it up individually.<br/>In the second example, everyone can do stuff either Harmoniously or Aggresively, but they each pick what they do (verb).                        </div>

                            In both cases, I was imagining "splats" as in-world representations of adverbs. You could set up a game so that you literally choose an adverb as a stat, or you could have something in your setting that your character can be a part of. That thing can be a family, race, movement, nation or any other kind of joinable organization, but what you're <i>really</i> saying when you join is that you want to do the adverb that the group represents.<br/><br/>The first example's verb was "fight." You could choose to be a member of the Dark Elves, and that represents "stealthily." Similarly, you could choose to be a warrior and that represents "violently."<br/><br/>You're right about the second example being a little different. The verb there is "overcome." In that one I guess I had in mind that all characters had some capacity for "harmoniously" or "aggressively" by default. The two movements in that example still represented the two adverbs too, so then it became a game about choosing whether to follow one path or another when you could see the value in both methods. So, in truth, the game's verb could also be "choose (a side)."<br/><br/>I do find your suggestion interesting, that characters could have a unifying verb or a unifying adverb. The first would be very suitable for D&amp;D type games where everyone's trying to achieve the same goals. The second would be good for more superhero-type games where everyone shares the same methodology but doesn't necessarily do the same stuff or have the same goals.

It's more likely that I've misspoken somewhere. This is why I toss the heavy-duty theory writing to the big dogs up here. :P                        </div>
