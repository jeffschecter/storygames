In order to continue to do that, we need your feedback in the form of the ENnie Awards Fan Survey. This survey will help the staff of the ENnie Awards learn what areas they are strong in, what areas need improvement, and how we can better market the Awards. Please be as honest and thorough as possible when answering.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?p=323" rel="nofollow">http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?p=323</a><br/><br/>Note: Not all of the questions require answers but we would certainly appreciate it if you would take the time to expand upon your answers to certain questions.<br/><br/>Thanks for all of your input!<br/><br/>Tony Law<br/>ENnies PR Coordinator                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232216/#Comment_232216" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T08:19:07+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  8:19AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bad Survey Designer! No soup for you!<br/><br/>You have "Yes / No" questions that are both mandatory and that don't have a "no opinion" answer.<br/><br/>It's like asking me if I like snozzberries and not accepting "I haven't tried snozzberries" as an answer.<br/><br/>In other words, I filled out your survey. Love the ENnies, wish I was still going to GenCon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
