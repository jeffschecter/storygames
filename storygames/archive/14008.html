I'm not sure what counts as 1st-person, but you play PCs and NPCs in the same way, if your group usually play in 1st person WTWE will be 1st person, if you prefer playing in 3rd person WTWE will be 3rd person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ally%20Nauss" title="Ally Nauss"><img alt="Ally Nauss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ally%20Nauss">Ally Nauss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317410/#Comment_317410" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-21T17:40:15+00:00" title="March 21, 2011  5:40PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how that would work in any game I actually know of...<br/><br/>But I now have visions of a game in which two players play separate personalities of the same person.

The Players set the Events and such in Scenes to play off each other and burn resources to sway them to their differentiated goals ...
