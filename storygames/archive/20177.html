As you crawl through dungeons, hunt vampires, or flee from zombies, you must pay attention to small clues from your surroundings to discern what the aliens want from you next, in the dim but desperate hope of eventually escaping their clutches.<br/><br/><b>How to Play</b><br/><br/>Get hold of a published adventure module/scenario from your favorite storytelling game or RPG and play it through the way you would normally (or alternatively, use some simple task-resolution hack if you like the look of scenario but can't be bothered to learn the rules).<br/><br/>The adventure will for the most part proceed exactly the way that it would have if you'd been playing the game "straight." But the GM will also be adding in two additional types of scenes that were not included in the original scenario.<br/><br/>1, BUGS - Near-omnipotent though the aliens are, their VR programming is occasionally a little buggy. Sometimes NPCs will step weirdly out of character, monsters will suddenly turn friendly, or everything in the gameworld will mysteriously turn pink for eleven seconds. This can sometimes serve as comic relief, but to the indentured career adventurer, it can also start to wear on the nerves.<br/><br/>2. PAUSES - Sometimes the aliens won't like how the story is going and pause the scenario to make adjustments to the narrative, or to communicate with player characters about how they might provide better entertainment. This can come in the form of a friendly (or obnoxious) voice from the sky, a message in a bottle, a sudden windfall (magic swords) or obstacle (severed limbs), or more subtle clues from one's surroundings about the aliens' ultimate agenda.<br/><br/>After a few adventures have been played through, it should be possible for players to have figured out at least a little bit about the fundamental character of the aliens' entertainment needs, and acquired an opportunity thereby to beg, bargain, or fight for iberation from their virtual prison.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445219/#Comment_445219" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-14T15:25:18+00:00" title="May 14, 2015  3:25PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.

It was an idea that James Wallis (The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Once Upon A Time, Hogshead Publishing) had about a fantasy world where the non-trademarked equivalent of the PHB, DMG, and Monster Manual fell out of the sky and were perceived to be a message from the Gods, and have become the Bible/Constitution of the World. It always sounded amazing and hilarious (check out <a href="http://www.whatisfrup.com/?page_id=7" rel="nofollow">this preview from 1995</a>), but was tragically never released. There was even talks of a revival a couple years back with an all-star team doing design- including Jenna Moran (Nobilis, Chuubo's). That also never panned out. There is a blog that delves further into the whole story here: <a href="http://www.whatisfrup.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatisfrup.com/</a><br/><br/>I agree that this (Parasite Gods) seems quite cool, but a little underdeveloped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445228/#Comment_445228" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-15T00:45:55+00:00" title="May 15, 2015 12:45AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2015 12:49AM by Paul_T.">edited May 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FRUP... oh, yes.

Mighty warriors, fierce monsters, inbred nobility, inbred peasantry, valiant knights, fire-breathing damsels, dragons in distress, and all the rest of that.

FRUP does look fascinating, though I guess you'd need a pretty sophisticated group to play it with.<br/><br/>Much as I'm fond of this idea, I'm also somewhat reluctant to give it a more complete write-up. I think any GM who'd be willing to take it on would probably have a preferred, genre-neutral task-resolution system already in mind. If I ever run this myself, I was thinking  of going with <a href="http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus.htm" rel="nofollow">RISUS</a>, which seems to me to set about the right tone). And there's a bunch of different ways one could conceive of the near-omnipotent aliens, so that's another place where I'd be unwilling to impose too may further constraints. <br/><br/>Can anyone think of anything else that might be added to make this a somewhat more "complete"-looking proposal?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lord_goon" title="lord_goon"><img alt="lord_goon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lord_goon">lord_goon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445241/#Comment_445241" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-15T19:00:41+00:00" title="May 15, 2015  7:00PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/open_sketchbook">@open_sketchbook</a>, I think it'd work better with multiple scenarios.

I'd want to know at least some possible parameters before attempting to play this by trial and error.<br/><br/>What do the aliens want to find out?<br/><br/>What would convince them to "release" the adventurers?<br/><br/>Is the (actual, human) players' goal in the game to discover the aliens' wants, or just to have fun being silly making a D&amp;D parody, or what? Is this a creepy Matrix/Dark City kind of mindfuck, or a goofy slapstick dungeon-crawling comedy?<br/><br/>Those are the kinds of things I'm not clear on from your description. (And I find it vague enough that I wouldn't play it - unless I happened to think about it for a while and come up with some brilliant answer, of course, but then I'd feel the really work had been done by me and not the originator of the concept. I feel that the setup presents a problem, but the solution is not provided, and the solution is where the meat of the "game design" challenge lies.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
