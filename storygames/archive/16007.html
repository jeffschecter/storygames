I revised the <b>winter comes to an end</b> move shortly before publishing and bungled it up a bit. (A) The characters obviously should be able to pick moves from their own playbooks, which isn't clear from the text. (B) there should be an additional option that says "transfer your character to a new playbook".<br/>3. There is very little to no guidance about bonds. I realized this yesterday during our game.

It's kind of an odd detail. Usually the singular "they" is used to obscure gender, so you don't have to write out "he or she" or whatever.<br/><br/>Personally, I think it's really weird and surreal to see/hear it used in a context where a specific gender is known or obvious, but people do it sometimes, like when a straight man says something like "the last person I dated, they used to do this thing..." I assume it will probably become more accepted in the future.<br/><br/>Your written English is quite good, overall. I don't pick up any idiosyncrasies that are obviously hold-overs from another language pattern.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365097/#Comment_365097" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T14:33:54+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  2:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2012 2:36PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One custom move I'd like to see for the Woman playbook:<br/><br/><b>Carrying On</b><br/>When your husband is away raiding, trading, or revenging for an entire season or longer, replace your custom moves with the custom moves in the Man playbook until he returns.<br/><br/>The moves in the Woman playbook sorta work for this (very common in history and saga) situation, but not quite. It might be weird in play but I bet it'd work OK.
