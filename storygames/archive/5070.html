I dearly loved <i>James Bond 007</i>, but I could never get my group to embrace it as fully as I, so we stuck with TSR's spy offerings, killing off Commie spies and pols and soldiers by the scads in various Central American and European locales.  It wasn't always <i>Rambo: First Blood, Part II</i> level, but sometimes the carnage came pretty darned close.<br/><br/>I wonder if there's a way to replicate the genre conventions of those '80s action films -- <i>Missing In Action</i>, <i>Death Before Dishonor</i>... or just about anything from Cannon Films, really -- without just focusing on the mechanic of blasting lots of hapless bad guys.  <i>Wushu</i> and games of its sort get right down to the piles o' bodies aspect, but there are some great story games out like <i>Contenders</i>, clearly influenced by <i>Rocky</i>, that get to the thematic heart of the film(s) by which they were inspired.<br/><br/>I'd certainly like to see somebody take a crack at it, because it's well beyond my ability.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114371/#Comment_114371" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T10:43:50+00:00" title="December 14, 2007 10:43AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you talk more about the thematic heart?

Everything in <i>Contenders</i> -- from the way characters are meant to earn money as arm-breakers and like, to the hope versus self-destruction motif -- is straight out of <i>Rocky</i>.  And I might point out that <i>Rocky</i> (deservedly) won Best Picture, something <i>Raging Bull</i> did not.  <i>Contenders</i> should be happy to flow from such inspiration.<br/><br/>Anyway... I started this thread more as a thinking-out-loud kind of thing and I'll continue that now.<br/><br/>It occurred to me that during the '80s we had a sort of twisted moral relativism in terms of heroes versus villains.  Whereas characters in films <i>now</i> do terrible things and then torment themselves about it, the films of the '80s sometimes showed some pretty awful acts on the part of the heroes without a trace of irony because we were good, the Commies were bad and they had it coming.<br/><br/>This tendency toward introspection has bled through into our roleplaying, and probably reached its apotheosis in the <i>Vampire</i> series which, at times, threatened to turn itself inside out what with all the mourning lost humanity, etc., etc., ad nauseum.  By contrast, take a look back at <i>Rambo: First Blood, Part II</i> and see how terribly cynical it is.  At the time, though, this subtext was completely lost on us; we saw the film as a rah-rah for the USA when it really wasn't.  And neither was the vastly superior original, either, but who's counting?<br/><br/>An idea about creating a plot/play mechanic that increases the advantage to the players depending upon their cruelty to deserving enemies is right at the edge of my imagination, but I can't figure how it'd work.  One of my favorite guilty pleasures is Sylvester Stallone's <i>Cobra</i>, which is such a fascistic spectacle that it has to be soaked in like Palmolive.  If a villain did some of things Cobretti does in that movie (like hanging the lead villain on a smelting hook and then setting him on fire), we'd be repulsed, but because the savagery is inflicted by the Good Guy on the Bad Guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114391/#Comment_114391" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T11:17:50+00:00" title="December 14, 2007 11:17AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam I Am</cite>Everything in<i>Contenders</i> ... is straight out of<i>Rocky</i>.</blockquote>\nMan, I really need to leave this alone.

But once again I'd love to discuss how to build the mechanism of these films' plots into a story game.  I don't want to give away anything about the latest movie except to say <i>go see it</i>.  Even if you think Rambo has nothing to offer you after 20 years, the movie will convince you otherwise.  Also it will make what I'm writing about here make a little more sense, though if you've seen the initial three films you already kind of get my drift.<br/><br/>By the time <a href="http://movies.break.com/rambo/" rel="nofollow">Rambo</a>'s climax rolls around -- no Commies in sight this time -- not only do you want to see the movie's bad guys die, but simple death seems too kind.  The protracted, even cataclysmic, violence at the end of the picture is entirely necessary to satisfy the audience, largely because the spring has been wound so tightly throughout the previous hour-plus.<br/><br/>So how to code that into a game?  It's not about the violence itself, or describing how a bunch of baddies get mowed down, because that's easily handled by a game such as <i>Wushu</i>.  This is violence as <i>story point</i>, and directly proportional to the badness of the villains.  The only way I can think of to describe what I'm trying to get at -- and I'm no game designer by any stretch of the imagination -- is a pool of violence into which the depravity of the antagonists goes, only to be tapped out by the protagonists in a furious burst of cathartic bloodletting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121914/#Comment_121914" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T11:30:31+00:00" title="January 25, 2008 11:30AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm all for a vengeance pool.

I guess for one I should let everyone know that Rambo IV is the Citizen Kane of action movies. It's the new standard by which all others should be judged, because it simultaneous embraces the genre's strengths (its' drama and heartpounding pace) while eschewing its' vices (heroes with no personality, gunfights where no one dies). It's seriously made me rethink the genre as a rich, emotive artform. You're doing yourself a grave disservice if you dismiss the film as mere action fare.<br/><br/>Sam, I see exactly what you mean. Without spoiling the story, the introductory sequence definitely alludes to the background of the story, standing the audience at full attention to the conflict within the story. As a technique for better story gaming, this is as simple and explicit a tool as it gets: Exposition of narrative.<br/><br/>Ramping up the story is as easy and difficult as being a good storyteller, methinks; but consistently challenging the players without railroading them could be the trick. It seems, much like many of the abstract qualities which make for a wonderful game and wonderful story, the hidden magic lies deep within the social contract. <br/><br/>So, in my mind, this comes back down to mechanizing social contract. Soon as I get that down, Gestalt will be in your mailbox. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
