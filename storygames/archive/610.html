                    All right. I have a first draft for a character sheet for this Meat Loaf LARP. <br/><br/>In the style of LARP I'm running, the rules should be clear from reading the character sheet. With that in mind, could you read through this character sheet as though you'd just been given it at the beginning of a LARP? Give me any reactions and, especially,  ask me questions about anything you don't understand.<br/><br/>I'd really, really appreciate any help on this. It would help me a great deal.<br/><br/>Here's the sheet.
<blockquote><b>Kenny</b><br/><br/>You are a teenage truant, bored with life and desperate for a change.<br/><br/>Tonight, you are at a biker rally at the Lost and Found, a dive bar on the edge of town. You are here looking for excitement. <br/><br/><b>The Cards</b><br/><br/>At the start of the game, you will be dealt two hands of cards: a hand of Black Fives and a hand of Red Fives. Keep these hands separate. <br/><br/>Your aim is to get rid of the Fives and get as many other Black and Red cards as possible. <br/><br/>Throughout the game, Aces are always low.<br/><br/><b>Love</b><br/><br/>Red cards represent Love.<br/><br/>You can get Love cards from someone by Making Love to them. You, Kenny, will generally want to make love to  older, glamorous women.<br/><br/>To make love to another (female) character:<br/><br/>1. Give her any one of your Love cards. <br/>2. She gives you any one of your Love cards.<br/>3. If the card you gave her is higher than the one she gave you, the love-making has gone wrong. You must stop Making Love and decide exactly what went wrong.<br/>4. If the card you gave her is lower or equal to the one she gave you, you reach First Base with her.<br/>5. If you reached First Base, repeat this process to attempt Second Base, Third Base and hit a Home Run.<br/><br/>At the end of Making Love, you both keep all the cards you were given. So you keep her cards and she keeps yours.<br/><br/>After Making Love, you must wait 5 minutes before trying again.<br/><br/><b>Rock</b><br/><br/>Black cards represent Rock. You, Kenny, can claim Rock cards from other players as follows:<br/><br/>Ã‚Â· Claim 1 Rock Card from everyone you beat in a bike race .<br/>Ã‚Â· Claim 1 Rock Card from Jenny, Samantha and Marvin if the biker gang lets you join.<br/>Ã‚Â· Claim 1 Rock Card from a gang member if you get to Second Base with them.<br/><br/>Also, if you are the first person to die tragically, claim 1 Rock card from everyone in the room.<br/><br/>You can also win Rock cards by Drinking Contests and Fighting.<br/><br/><b>Drinking and Fighting</b><br/><br/>When you have a Drinking Contest or a Fight with another player:<br/><br/>1. The other player draws one of your Rock cards, at random.<br/>2. You draw one of the other playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rock cards, at random.<br/>3. If your card (which the other player drew) is higher, you win. If it is lower, you lose. If they are equal, draw again.<br/><br/>Whoever wins keeps all the cards that were drawn.<br/><br/>Afterwards, decide with the other player exactly what happened. If a biker wins a fight with another biker, perhaps he smashed him over the head with a bottle; if a teenage girl wins a fight with a biker, she probably kicked him in the balls.<br/><br/><b>Bikes</b><br/><br/>There will be three races tonight: one at sunset, one at midnight and one at dawn.<br/><br/>If you want to compete, you will need a bike. Someone may be willing to lend you one.<br/><br/>In addition, you know how to repair, modify and even sabotage bikes. This means that you can add blue 'Modification' cards to bikes or add them on; and you can remove red 'Damage' cards or add them on. Doing any of these takes two minutes, during which you must kneel beside the bike.<br/><br/><b>The End Of The Game</b><br/><br/>At the end of the game, discard all Fives from your hand. Then count how many Love cards and Rock cards you have.<br/><br/>The player with the most Love cards rides out of town to a new life. They may choose one other character to take with them. They have been saved by Love.<br/><br/>The player with the most Rock cards dies gloriously in a bike crash. They have been saved by Rock.<br/><br/>Everyone else is condemned to spend the rest of their lives in this God-forsaken town.</blockquote> </div>

<blockquote>1. This is just one of many sheets, right?</blockquote>
Yes. Each character gets a different sheet.
<blockquote>2. Are the cards Kenny gets all fives for a reason, do other players have diferent mixes of cards?</blockquote>
Each character gets a different rank of card to start. The Gang Leader starts with Kings, the schoolkids get low cards, down to the gang dogsbody who gets Aces (which are low). <br/><br/>So, at the start, the Gang Leader will win all his conflicts, but gradually he'll start losing.
<blockquote>3. How does one get in the gang? just through talk,or is there some mechanicor fightrace?</blockquote>
Essentially, just through talk. But it's up to the players playing the gang members. If they want to insist new members win a bike race or a fight, they're welcome to.
<blockquote>5. How does one die tragically?</blockquote>
I don't know. I'm hoping they'll surprise me.
<blockquote>6. How does the race work?</blockquote>
I'm not 100% sure yet, but I've got ideas. In any case, I'll explain the rules when the race starts.<br/><br/>Thanks! Very useful.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<blockquote>I'd suggest, just for symmetry, that you have to wait 5 minutes after a drinking or fighting contest, too.</blockquote>
Now, the thing is, not everyone waits 5 minutes to have sex again. Kenny only waits 5 minutes because he's a teenager. The Gang Leader has to wait half an hour. It depends on age and sex (generally, women and young men are good to go again very quickly). This is meant to encourage infidelity.<br/><br/>But, yes, some way of preventing drinking and fighting recurring too soon would be good. Perhaps a rule where, once you've had a drink and fight with someone, you have to drink or fight with someone else before doing it again.
<blockquote>Should that be "Claim 1 Rock Card from everyone else in a bike race you won"?</blockquote>
Actually, no, it's "Take 1 rock card from everyone who you did better than". I'll make that clearer. Different characters have different ways of claiming cards for bike races. Some do have an "If you win..." condition.
<blockquote>The rules for bike races are notably lacking.</blockquote>
Yes, those won't go on the character sheet. I'll explain them at the start of the race.<br/><br/>Very useful, thank you.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I'm glad the comments are useful, Graham. <br/><br/>That five minutes thing is cool, I didn't think it might be character specific.<br/><br/>With regard to delays between tests, I have found this good and bad. I ran a large, one-off, Mad Max style game which had a rule for this - after a fight, the winner couldn't just hammer on the loser again. This caused annoyance for some people (who really wanted to take an enemy down) but was good for others (people jumped by gangs and outclassed). I was fairly happy with this result, because the second effect was the one I was aiming for. Not sure if that's useful to you, but there it is.<br/><br/>I think you should at least mention on the sheet that the bike race rules will be explained when the first race happens. And what if people want to organise their own? I can see a couple of rivals racing just as often as fighting...                        </div>

                            bq. Yes, those won't go on the character sheet. I'll explain them at the start of the race.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I'd want to at least have _some_ idea from start of play what I needed to do to win a race.  High black cards?  Full mechanical details are required, but a little hint at whether I should bother, or what I should be doing if I want to try is important.  Relatedly, how cool is Kenny's ability to mod bikes?  Race winning?<br/>
<br/>
bq. If two players have only one Rock card apiece and those cards are equal, there's no out.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, as I read this, we each draw each other's cards, tie, and then nothing.  Because in order for "the winner keeps all cards drawn" to work, they need to be kept separate.  So each draw diminishes your hand.  What's needed is the zero-card hand condition.  What if someone challenges me to a fight and I have no cards?  What if, by the process of fighting, two players run out of cards at the same time?  (Tragic death?  Exchange love cards?)<br/>
<br/>
Any chance this will be published?                        </div>

<br/>
Yes, you're right. At the very least, there needs to be an indication of what will stand you in good stead to win the bike race. <br/>
<br/>
On second thoughts: If the two cards are tied I think that, for simplicity, the conflict should be tied. Which means that the whole question of "Does a draw diminish your hand?" doesn't come up. Oh, hang on, it comes up while Making Love, so I'll put a sentence in to make that clear.<br/>
<br/>
Not much chance it'll be published, really, but I appreciate the enthusiasm.<br/>

<blockquote>Could you at least make the cards available? this is so cool I want to spread it around.</blockquote>
They're playing cards. The Gang Leader starts out with Kings, his girlfriend starts out with Queens and so on down in order of status. The high school kids are way down the pecking order, with Fives, Fours, Threes and Twos. <br/><br/>Oh, wait, I said that earlier in the thread. Are those the cards you meant?<br/><br/>You'll need more than one pack of playing cards: say about three or four. <br/><br/>Right at the bottom is the member of the gang that everyone hates. He gets Aces, which are low. I've called him Hamster which, in my mind, is a tribute to the "Rat" in Troy Costisick's game Cutthroat. <br/><br/>(If you like the idea of this game, Troy's game is well worth checking out).<br/><br/>Thanks for thinking it's cool. I'm very happy about that. Personally, I thought I'd be the only one enthusiastic about a Meat Loaf LARP.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            All right, I think I know how to do the bike races.<br/>
<br/>
To start, everyone racing must play one Rock card (given to the GM). Whoever plays the highest card starts in the lead, whoever plays the second-highest starts second and so on. The racers stand in a line to indicate this.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone not racing is a spectator.<br/>
<br/>
Then, there's five rounds.<br/>
<br/>
Each round, the bikers write on a piece of paper what they're trying to do. For example: "Drive really fast", "Force Jimmy off the road", "Overtake on the inside". The GM writes something about the road conditions on a piece of paper: "Sudden curve", "Oil on road".<br/>
<br/>
Everyone shows their piece of paper at the same time. The spectators then decide what actually happens: Does Jimmy go off the road? Does anyone crash?<br/>
<br/>
In particular, the spectators decide who overtakes who. If someone overtakes, they change their position in the line to indicate this. A racer may only overtake one other racer per round.<br/>
<br/>
Repeat until the race is won.<br/>
<br/>
To use a bike modification, you write it on your paper as part of what you want to do. For example, if you've got the "Blades On Wheels" modification, you might write "Use Blades to force Jimmy off the road". When the spectators decide what happens, they're encouraged to think of modifications as <i>really cool</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Damage works in a similar way. If you have a damage card on your bike, you <i>must</i> write that damage on your card at some point. For example, if you have the damage "Dodgy exhaust", you should write "Exhaust gives out cloud of smoke" at some point during the race.<br/>
<br/>
Something like that?<br/>
<br/>

                            bq. Not much chance it'll be published, really, but I appreciate the enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
You're breaking my heart here.  Not even a PDF?  <br>
<br>
I mean, especially after the cycle race that's based on audience approval.  (Of course, a Battle of the Bands would work equally well, or a demolition derby, or...)    <br>
<br>
Any rules for how the currently playing song from ??Bat Out of Hell?? effects the mechanics?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I like the idea of different songs affecting the mechanics, but the game is three hours long, and even I don't want to listen to Bat Out Of Hell three times back to back.<br>

<p>Dear Graham,</p>

                            Hey,
<blockquote>This is a con-LARP again, right? All the rules on the character sheet, plus a "stern talking-to" by you (the organizer of the event)?</blockquote>
Yep. You've done this before, obviously.
<blockquote>Love-making: What is the preferred gaming-style here? (My take: set a precedent, or make note of cool Innovations from players, so that other players emulate that instead of falling back on something worse or less Loafy.) </blockquote>
I'm not sure quite what you mean. I'm envisioning two characters would talk for a few minutes, then one will say "Want to make love?" and they'll go into the mechanics.
<blockquote>Bike-racing: Ditto. Your idea of "letting the crowd play it out" is fine, but I'd like to hear some ideas from you on how it'd look when playing it. Would the racers be narrating the event, duelling-banjo style?</blockquote>
No, the spectators narrate it, commentary-style.<br><br>It'll be heavily GM-ed, to take people through it. For example...<br><br><i>GM: OK. Turn one. Bikers, write on a card what you're doing.<br>[Pause while bikers scribble. Let's call them A, B and C.]<br>GM: And hold up your cards.<br>[A, B, and C hold up cards saying "Drive like hell", "Overtake on the inside" and "Knock B off his bike", respectively. GM holds up a card saying "Sudden curve"]<br>GM: OK. Spectators, what happens?<br>Spectator 1: B gets knocked off his bike while he's overtaking<br>Spectator 2: And the guy who's driving like hell has to brake for the sudden curve<br/>Spectator 3: So C goes ahead<br/>GM: Nice. C and A, change places. Round 2.</br></br></br></br></br></br></i><br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></div>
