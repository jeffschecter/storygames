It's not happened yet, but I'm not sure what to do if it does. <br/><br/>Unless I've missed something, if the Dogs come in to a town and the big 'problem' is that Br Jed has decided that his wife Sr Mary is no longer the one for him and the King of Life is happy for him to set up home with Br Henry as his new wife if the Dogs just go 'yeah, I've no problem with that, nothing wrong here' everything is just kind of instantly better. If I've decided that's why the demons were there, wouldn't they just shrug their shoulders and leave, or would they latch on to a different 'sin' in the set up and just change allegiance as they were in the area?<br/><br/>I may be worrying over nothing, a mix of pitching the heresy right and the unspoken contract of 'we're here to deal with heresy so something here must be heretic' could just gloss it over, although I know the latter is what we did in the first game I ever played and because we felt we had to be upset by what was happening it just didn't feel 'fulfilling'.<br/><br/>I'd be interested in hearing if other people have dealt with similar worries, or just some general 'don't worry' type advice :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424355/#Comment_424355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T08:07:51+00:00" title="November 18, 2013  8:07AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2013 8:08AM by renatoram.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whatever the Dogs decide is right in a town is right (in the eyes of Faithful Law): they have the absolute religious/civil* authority given to them by the Elders in Bridal Falls.<br/><br/>*as long as it's about Faithful: a Sheriff that's not one of the faithful will probably have something to say...<br/><br/><br/>The faithful know that an will generally abide, but that doesn't rule out someone rebelling: they'll have to decide how to deal with them.<br/><br/>If the Dogs come to town, see the behavior you wrote down as "the problem", and decide that's not a problem at all then that's their decision.

It's about presumptuousness and contempt for those whose good will you depend on, and all the evil effects that emerge are the consequences of that attitude.

It's not like everyone in town is going to respect the Dogs' authority, any more than they would if the Dogs showed up and said 'everything you are doing is wrong! everything!' Some people <i>want</i> the Dogs to say that "the problem" is a sin. Everybody wants something from the Dogs, and the whole town never wants the same thing.<br/><br/>Moreover, town generation is pretty clear about the course of demonic influence -- demons only arrive after the town is thoroughly dysfunctional, usually because of major clashes between the personalities and desires of its inhabitants. Again, the Dogs just being like 'this is all fine' does not somehow make that so. It may make it so in terms of religious doctrine, but the town generation rules aren't about religious doctrine -- they're about social and cultural conflicts that have spiraled out of control. <br/><br/>So yeah, the Dogs can do that, and some people will be happy and some people will be upset, but the likelihood that it will solve the problems of the town are relatively low.

And if the Dogs decide to just leave... I guess as a GM you should drive towards conflict and don't let them, but the option of postponing the effects of their non-action to a later game in the same town seems a good option too (if playing a campaign, obviously).<br/><br/>Am I remembering it wrong?

Dogs don't have absolute religious law authority. Their job is to solve problems in a town that its steward can't solve, not to pronounce religious law. <br/><br/>I mean, they can pronounce religious law if they want, if doing so helps them solve a town's problems. They can pronounce any fool thing they want to pronounce. But pronouncing something doesn't mean they're right about it.<br/><br/>There's no such thing as <i>right</i> or <i>wrong</i> in Dogs in the Vineyard. The only thing there is, is <i>did</i> or <i>didn't do</i>.<br/><br/>The girl married her boyfriend and it was a sin, and now the Dogs say that it's fine: all that we know from this is that it was a sin, and now the Dogs say it's fine. This doesn't mean that it's no longer a sin. It's not suddenly fine according to religious law (because you decided that it wasn't during town creation) or the will of God (because there is no God, or if there is, His opinions are unknown to us). <br/><br/>It just means that the Dogs are contradicting the doctrine of the Faith, that's all.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424441/#Comment_424441" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T09:26:02+00:00" title="November 19, 2013  9:26AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reed,<br/>  There are a couple of issues swirling around here:<br/>1) What happens if the player shutdown your town problem?<br/>2) What happens if you and the players do not agree what is heretical?<br/>3) What are satisfactory solutions when GM and player interpretations are disconnected?<br/><br/>RE: 1) There is a progression if you do town creation, punch it up to the next progression. If you followed the town creation process, it leads to stuff that is simply not acceptable (murder eventually). You may need to retcon the original offense, or change the perspective that the sinner is coming from. But it should be salvageable.<br/>RE: 2) This depends on how salvageable this is. If it is just a semantic thing, then carry on. If what is happening is heinous enough that they are breaking more than one rule, then you are good. If the problem cannot be easily adjusted, maybe it is time to talk to the group? Ultimately, this question seems like it is more about how much you trust the players to "get it" and play along. If this is a serious concern for you, then you need to work that out with your players, right?<br/>RE: 3) Barring that, essentially, you only have a few options: a) keep escalating until the players are roused to action, b) retcon to make the current scenario match the new interpretation, c) adjust the motivations behind the action to make them more heretical, d) Let the town go to hell after the Dogs leave town, e) Let the town be uneventful.<br/>  These options are just taking the good advice provided and putting them in a practical frame of mind.<br/><br/>  I sure hope this helps!<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424442/#Comment_424442" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T09:32:11+00:00" title="November 19, 2013  9:32AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main solution to this is that in town creation you already know what will happen if the Dogs do nothing.
