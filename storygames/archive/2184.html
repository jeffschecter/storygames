                    I'm running a little experiment at <a href="http://conception.modus-operandi.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Conception</a> at the end of the month that I've dubbed <a href="http://collective-endeavour.com/node/81" rel="nofollow">"Playtest Camp."</a> It's arisen from my plan, as in many other years, to take some of my in-progress designs along and subject them to friends. Except this year, I've opened this up, and hope to take a small number of other games along to playtest. But more than that, I'm planning on printing a bunch of these docs out and getting <i>other people</i> to playtest them at the con, not just me.<br/><br/>As I've been putting together playtest docs of my own to take with me, I've been doing so with an eye to the possibility that someone else might pick them up. So I've been asking myself some questions, and I'd like to throw them open to you guys too. I'm not just talking for the purposes of Playtest Camp - I'm talking for the purposes of playtesting, period. I'd like to talk about how we playtest our games, or rather, how we can facilitate other people playtesting our games.<br/><br/>How can we make our playtest documents as user-friendly as possible? How can we maximise the chances that someone will not only pick the document up but will <b>read and play it</b>? How can we avoid overwhelming/befuddling the user so they don't play? And how can we make it as easy as possible for the user to provide the designer with the most useful possible feedback?<br/><br/>My ideas at the moment are revolving around reducing the amount of time the user has to spend learning the game rules to start playing. I'm thinking some up front briefing sheets to get the players as comfortable and onboard as possible, and on with playing the game and seeing what works.<br/><br/>Also, I think actual, factual directed questions and design outcomes wouldn't go amiss at all. If you can point the user in the right direction, even if it's something as simple as "we've tried this, we think it works - does it work for you?" I think it can only help. And, as with usual design threads, these questions have to be more specific than "whaddaya think."<br/><br/>So what else? Feedback sheets? Post-game debriefings? Design commentary? Examples a-go-go? What?<br/><br/>It also occurs to me that this might go hand in hand with Paul <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1859&amp;page=1#Item_15" rel="nofollow">talking</a> <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1904#Item_9" rel="nofollow">about</a> <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1912&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">ashcans</a>, but I'm not sure yet.<br/><br/>Talk to me!                </div>

It is, to an extent, but a playtest will always run into useability problems that a finished game won't ... or rather, it will run into different problems. People pay money for a finished game and therefore feel more obliged (guilty? likely?) to play it, to work it into their regular schedule. The game's useability comes into effect at the play stage, but not necessarily the purchasing stage.<br/><br/>A playtester has no such obligation, and may have more trouble fitting it into their regular schedule as a result, unless they put aside time for such things. The game's useability comes into effect here, making the difference between successful play and unsuccessful play, but there's also another useability issue - that of the useability of the playtest document itself, which can mean the difference between the playtester not even wanting/trying to play it.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think open forums are the best place to get your post-game debriefings, unless you have issues with transparency.</blockquote>
Yes I completely agree. I conducted the Dead of Night playtest in a closed and private forum - this was one of my biggest mistakes with it, and I regret it to this day. <br/><br/>I'm planning on bundling some feedback sheets with each of the playtest docs at Playtest Camp, to make feedback into even more of a no brainer. The people who play the games at Conception can fill them in then and there and give them back to me to feedback to the creator online. If they're so desired they can also post a report online, but even if they never take that step some feedback has still been given.                        </div>

                            Hey Andrew,<br/><br/><span style="color: #993300;">People pay money for a finished game and therefore feel more obliged (guilty? likely?) to play it, to work it into their regular schedule.</span><br/><br/>I don't think this is true. Gamer culture attaches no responsibility to the customer who purchases a game. The transaction is simply considered to give the purchaser ownership of the game object, to read it or not, use it or not, however as he will. Producer and Consumer are roles within the context of commerce. Not being further obliged to a Producer after a purchase transaction is a social protection we afford to a Consumer within this context of commerce.<br/><br/>So, with the goal of actually provoking playtesting, some folks try incentives, esteem rewards, non-monetary transactions, or social mojo. These can work, but they can also be quite uncomfortable. Because the relationship still has an Authority/Resource context analogous to the Producer/Consumer context of commercial transactions. And so it becomes an uncomfortable social pressure.<br/><br/>I think if your goal is to provoke playtesting what you need is a alternative kind of transaction that engages the purchaser differently than the traditional Authority/Resource or Producer/Consumer purchasing transaction contexts.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

Yes, it needs to be different somehow, less of the ... hmm, I wanna say prelude to the finished thing, but that robs playtest of its importance to the design process somewhat. But I know what you mean. The relationship between playtester and designer needs to be different from the relationship between customer and publisher, or even player and designer, even if they're the same people throughout. Is that what you're telling me, or have I mangled your intent.<br/><br/>I've just reread the ashcan threads I linked to up top and perhaps that has helped crystalise some of my thoughts. I think what I'm trying to get at is, how can we lubricate the design wheels so that playtesting happens more easily? What makes up a good playtest doc/ashcan, so that any barrier between play/not play are removed?                        </div>

And yes, you're quite right of course. I just have to look behind me at my gaming bookcase as testament to that fact. Sure, I've bought all 4 shelves worth of games in my time, but has that given me an obligation to play all of them? Nope. It's just meant I've paid money to own them.                        </div>

Will there be an opportunity for silent observation?  Maybe with an audio or video recorder so you're less of a presence?                        </div>

                            The very best playtests are also an advertisement for your game.<br/>
<br/>
"Hey guys, I playtested this fucking cool thing from the Internet."<br/>
<br/>
I strongly think that playtests should be conducted by strangers to you and you should not be involved in the game.<br/>
<br/>
If they fumble and misstep and are miserable and they all hate your game, that is important information.  If they don't understand something, that is important information - more important than their understanding of the thing they don't understand.<br/>
<br/>
As to how to be a good playtester, here are my rules of thumb (not always adhered to completely):<br/>
<br/>
Use every piece of the game more than once.  If there's a character creation section, make 20 characters. If there's a situation creation section, make 20 situations.  If there's a setting section, design 20 campaigns and/or adventures.  If there's a combat section, run 20 combats.<br/>
<br/>
Go from setting to system and back.  If the setting makes you think "hey, I bet my guy would be climbing this mountain", go to the system and see if you can have fun mountain climbing.  If the system makes you think "I bet everyone here carries swords, they rock!" flip to the setting and see if everyone indeed carries swords.<br/>
<br/>
Take notes on everything.<br/>
<br/>
This is hard work and usually necessitates compensation, in the form of money, food, or credit.                        </div>

                            While I think the parallels to usability testing (apparently I'm not the only one with that day job) are maybe a little sketchy, I think getting an audio/video recording of a playtesting session (in which you are not involved) would be extremely valuable for evaluating a certain subset of results. What people actually do and what people self-report themselves as doing are often very different. The thing is, I think most designers care about both -- it's important if people think your game is awesome, and it's also important that your game actually be awesome when people play it. Presumably you're not just playtesting the mechanics, but the entire experience of the game.                        </div>

I had thought about this, with some sort of improved hand-holding, designer commentary and so on to help them find their way through it and get playing faster. But then I thought, hey, isn't that sort of stuff useful, full stop? And I think the answer is yes - advice and design commentary is useful, no matter who it's for.                        </div>

So would you say that it is valid for the ashcan version to contain different advice, guidance and design notes that won't appear in the final version?                        </div>

Well hopefully we can help one another - that's the point of this topic, after all!

That's a good idea, and a great way to get all the players in on the rules from the start, not just the guy who's read it. But, wouldn't this be a good idea for the game, playtest or not?
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite><br/>My question is, should I just give you a mechanic and let your bang on it in your own way, or should I tell you tell you what I'm trying to acheive?

I think both ways are equally valid, although I think a lot of it depends on where you are in the playtest. Early on you might want to let the groups bang away on their own and see what they come up with. Perhaps a little later when you've overcome some design problems, you might want to add a note in the margin and comment that you had a problem, this was how you fixed it, and flag this up to the playtesters.

The real advantage of an open forum isn't so much the amount of detail you get, but the interaction between the various playtesters, and other non-playtesters. Feedback sparks discussion which hopefully will make your game better.                        </div>

Up to you, but I'd say the including the names of everyone who helped you is a minimum.  Comps aren't always practical - at this point I'd be giving away 52 copies of Grey Ranks.  I can't afford that!                        </div>

Yes, although I expect any good text I write will find a way into the final. I find it very useful to write a harshly condensed version of parts of the rules in order to help myself figure out what's important and what's not important about the mechanics and setting.                        </div>

That sounds like a good process, and must help when playtesting. I guess a good playtest document is stripped back to the core of what it is and what it does. I mean, do you need to "playtest" a setting?                        </div>

                            Really? I'm serious Jason, really? Tell me more! Once you recover that is!<br/><br/>I've always playtested settings in the past, but I always assumed that was just as part of playtesting the rules. I'm not sure we ever said "this makes no sense, this doesn't work, you need more here." Or maybe we did and just never realised it?                        </div>

                            *blink*<br/><br/>I do write little procedural documents, mostly for my own use, as outlines:<br/><br/><i>2.  Choose situation elements, one per player, based on character Grid positions.  Share these and note them somewhere everybody can refer to.<br/><br/>3.  Choose a Mission Leader.  The chosen player should outline the scope and particulars of the Mission, with everyone's input.  <br/><br/>4.  Form the Scene Pool, with each player contributing two dice - one based on a Reputation aspect and the other based on their character's position on the Grid.</i><br/><br/>That sort of thing.  It all gets folded into the final text.                        </div>

                            Setting playtests are absolutely vital because settings are of paramount concern to many gaming groups. Remember that not every group buys "system does matter" to the same degree and nobody is going to be convniced about it by reading your game text because their group's social structure will shit on your game text every time. Plenty of people cheerfully play GURPS Forgotten Realms, Storyteller swords and sorcery, and I myself scoff at people who whine about the "feel" of a game. (God dammit, I have no feelings, I am an unfeeling monster, what I want is meat, not suet!)<br/><br/>The questions to be answered in setting playtests are crucial:<br/><br/>Does the setting I've created both permit and encourage the kind of play I want to see?<br/><br/>Is the setting easily customizable to individual groups' tastes? (And have I given decent advice on how to accomplish this customization?)<br/><br/>Are players moved and excited by the setting material to want to play in this game? To want to make a character? What sort of characters do they make and how do those characters fit into the setting?<br/><br/>This is another area where it's important to do hands-off playtesting. If you wanted a political, Machiavellian setting and you got back a bunch of crime-and-punishment action-and-melodrama play reports in your setting, you know your setting materials have failed to produce what you wanted them to produce.  You might look at your espionage setting and see "Smiley's People" but if a big chunk of playtest GMs look at it and say "Hm, looks like Spies Like Us", you have an issue. <br/><br/>Note that not getting to where you want with a playtest - whether it be system or setting - is not necessarily a bad thing. If you're getting a wide variety of reports but everyone's having fun, you're on the right trail, even if about eighty percent of the reports have nothing whatsoever to do with your "vision" for ideal play.<br/><br/>Setting playtesting is of vast, VAST importance. For a lot of groups, it's more important than your system because they don't care about your system. I know, I know, everyone who is virtuous and good and right-thinking does, but as Lyle Lovett says, "down here among the unclean, all your good just comes undone."                        </div>

                            Hmm, I hadn't really considered that before Jason. But of course you're right - it's something I've done before as part of a playtest, only I didn't really consider it then, it just sort of happened. It often prompted comments like "there's not enough about this" or "tell me this" which is absolutely valid.<br/><br/>Of course, a lot of setting playtesting is almost implicit as part of playing the game, not as consciously or directly addressed as mechanics.<br/><br/>But setting does have an important connection with the mechanical aspect of a playtest. I remember a few months back I ran a playtest of the Inn at the Edge of Forever, and it flopped. But when we discussed it afterwards the players concluded that the problem lay with not having enough background/setting information, which in turn meant that they weren't sure what they were meant to be doing, the theme or context that the mechanics and game were meant to work with.<br/><br/>So do you include setting information in a playtest document? Do you/can you/should you playtest both setting and mechanics side by side? I'm guessing the answer to all is yes.                        </div>

                            Grey Ranks is about two-thirds setting, and the procedural information is embedded in it so tightly it wouldn't make much sense alone.  <br/>
<br/>
I have done some purely mechanical playtesting, by saying "Forget everything but the die rolls and movement, let's just see how this flows."  The problem is that there are thematic choices players make that this sort of testing can't address.                        </div>
