There are a large number of instances where that would be a really dumb thing to do, including of course works of historical realism, etc.<br/><br/>My expectation from a contemporary author is that they accurately point out the problematic content as problematic. If your work is set in the real world in any historical period including the present, for example, then your "setting" includes sexism. My "ethic" expectation is then not that you fail to represent women in your work (if men's stories are the only stories that matter, then you're channeling and upholding the sexism of your setting), but that you do tell the stories of the women, as well, including but not limited to stories about their struggling against dominant sexism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Abstract_Machine" title="Abstract_Machine"><img alt="Abstract_Machine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/129/nO5PORA7XV4QA.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Abstract_Machine">Abstract_Machine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442289/#Comment_442289" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-30T10:21:26+00:00" title="January 30, 2015 10:21AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \u201c<i>Every people deserves to conserve its identity without being ideologically colonised</i>,\u201d Frankie quoted. \u201cExcept of course by us, because we\u2019re not an ideology but a naturally occurring condition of the world.

(I'm sure it's not the only philosophical question under the sun we disagree on - no big deal.)<br/><br/>To me it seems pretty probable that a better social arrangement for a forward-reaching civilization is to embrace imagination, discourse and a plurality of values. I've often written here at Story Games about my principles on this: even the questionable, wrong-headed and loathsome are part of the grand discourse, and we should have no fear of them if we truly believe them to be wrong. An overlay of rote morality does nothing to help in this process, not unless you believe that the task of cultural creation is to indoctrinate rather than expose ideas for further dialogue. I would disagree with that: I think that the creator's task is to communicate ideas, not impose their own values (or the values of a moral majority for that matter) on their audience.<br/><br/>Things become even more complex when we realize that art can depict things in multiple modes of meaning, and these modes are often interpretations of the audience, not the creator. This means that we cannot even say categorically that the wrongheaded sexist content is intended to be taken as a serious political, propagandist statement; it might be a critical deconstruction, humorous satire, angry mirror of human condition or a hilariously failed attempt by a neo-nazi to justify themselves, instead of an earnest appeal to conservative values or comfortable blindness to the artist's underlying assumptions. It is a very simple idea that a work featuring e.g. sexism is necessarily "channeling and upholding" sexism.<br/><br/>The kind of equal-attention recipe you suggest for art is tantamount to saying that specific subcultural groups in society cannot - or should not, rather - talk to themselves via public art, for doing so would be exclusive of others who do not partake of their concerns. That's often what is going on when male art is criticized for being non-inclusive: it's art created by men, often of specific interest, for other men like them. War veteran memoirs are a pretty good example of what I mean; are they ethically suspect for, more often than not, being stories about men, for men? (I won't ask about stories by women for women - I understand that this isn't an issue because the underprivileged are allowed their freedoms, including the freedom of internal discourse.)<br/><br/>I'll add that I do see a real issue in the male-emphasis (and other similar biases, such as the emphasis on the white race, anti-religiousness, etc.) in the mainstream of rpg culture: the substantial harm involved is that gamers who would like to play games with other sorts of elements may find themselves under-serviced, and socially in the margins for their interests. The actual cause is not that men like to talk to men, though; rather, the issue is that women are not perceived as a credible and interesting audience by the people actually creating game texts. Whether this might be improved by more women writing game texts (on the principle that they'll be more interested in writing games for women), or by supporting women as a more economically and intellectually interesting part of the audience (to inspire creators to talk to them, specifically) is an intriguing question. I would certainly agree with the sentiment that art belongs to all, and it is worthwhile to do things about this; haunting people for doing their own thing just doesn't seem like a very well thought-out strategy in this regard.<br/><br/>In summation: I believe that the pro-equality position and pro-plurality position in this matter can be interpreted harmoniously by focusing on the actual issues in how people treat each other, rather than trying to make artistic expression conform to a single format of liberal value expression. It's an ill-considered approach, trying to brow-beat people into including a party line in all of their creations in an effort to force specific values into the culture. Reminds me of socialist realism, the artistic school adjunct to the political goals of the Communist party in the USSR. Setting aside this focus on pressuring artists and instead creating better art and better conditions for human equality in the hobby seems like a more worthwhile approach, and one that I'd expect most to agree on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442291/#Comment_442291" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-30T11:15:01+00:00" title="January 30, 2015 11:15AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2015 11:36AM by AsIf.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +100.<br/><br/>Whenever a person alters or limits their own work based on the expectations of others, they are acting as a marketer, not as an artist.<br/><br/>For those who insist on bringing ideological hobbyhorses to the gaming table, a short reminder is in order: Democracy is not about everyone having the same ideas.

(I won't ask about stories by women for women - I understand that this isn't an issue because the underprivileged are allowed their freedoms, including the freedom of internal discourse.)</blockquote>\nPersonally, I like to focus on pragmatism rather than ideology in this regard. That is: one facet of privilege is that talking to your own group via public art is, by definition, always available to you; another facet of privilege is that you don't <i>have</i> to qualify which group you're targeting, as your group is by definition the default target. What I'm urging privileged creators to do is developing an awareness of their privilege and acting on this awareness.<br/><br/>Maybe when you're aware of your privilege you'll decide it's not that good an idea to target your own group exclusively with your public art, or maybe you'll take extra steps in defining what "your group" exactly is without blindly assuming it as the default, or something.<br/><br/>My own moral philosophy, and possibly our only point of disagreement, is that I believe privilege to come with an attached burden of responsibility, where the responsibility is one to act toward counteracting your own privilege rather than furthering it \u2014 and no, I don't believe any action can be "neutral" toward the status quo. That is, if anything balances privilege out it's that you can't escape public scrutiny for how you wield it, even with your own choices as an artist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442293/#Comment_442293" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-30T13:15:24+00:00" title="January 30, 2015  1:15PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad to hear that we're not so very apart in opinion.<br/><br/>I can subscribe to your recommendations as <i>virtuous heuristics</i>, speaking of moral philosophy. I mean that I agree that it is probably, all things being equal, a good idea for considerate social actors to follow the guidelines you suggest for artists. By being aware of social privileges, and making conscious decisions, the art - and communication in general - will be sharper and better.<br/><br/>(I phrase myself in a somewhat peculiar way in comparison to usual American social justice dialogue for a specific reason - I want to emphasize that I do not see this privilege consideration as a duty, but merely as a good idea for pragmatic purposes. Therefore failing to follow it is not a moral evil either, merely a social behaviour that could be foolish.)<br/><br/>My own ethical statement is a sort of transcendental-existential-futurist-utilitarism - we don't know what we're striving for, but we'll know it if we see it, and in the meantime we want to move forward rather than backward, because we already know that "it" is not back there. Applying to the particular question of privilege, I believe it to be a phenomenon with societal origins, and that phenomenon has both useful and harmful facets at particular times in history. Privilege brings with it the moral duty to use it for excellence, but not an entailed duty to eradicate it. There might be, for particular types of privilege at particular times, specific reasons for its eradication, in which case the duty to do so falls to everyone, privileged as well as non-privileged. It's not fair, but then Immanuel Kant usually isn't <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(Because privileges are usually only discussed in negative light in this context, a simple example of a privilege that might be positive: meritocratic privilege is often considered a moral good because it empowers those best capable of acting well, and it encourages people to better themselves. Considering such examples, I cannot in good conscience support an universal eradication of privilege as a societal phenomenon)<br/><br/>I will be the first to admit that the fact that my moral philosophy does not consider liberal virtues such as egalitarism and democracy to be fundamental values, but rather merely instrumental, is intuitively pretty troubling - I've certainly struggled with it. Can't help but go where the logic leads, though <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442294/#Comment_442294" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-30T13:37:35+00:00" title="January 30, 2015  1:37PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (This is not a direct answer to any specific comments in the thread so far.)<br/><br/>It's worth remembering that there is a difference between (using gender discrimination as an example) depicting a world in which sexism exists, specifically depicting acts of gender discrimination, and writing sexist fiction.<br/><br/>The latter would be where, for example, not only does the society depicted hold men in higher regard than women, but it seems to be a truth of the world that this is justified.<br/><br/>Depicting acts of gender discrimination I don't think anyone objects to. If that's the subject matter you want to explore, then by all means.<br/><br/>Conversely, writing sexist fiction I think is difficult to support without holding those sexist views oneself. Possibly as some sort of experiment, and in that case I think it would be dishonest to present it as just any other work of fiction.<br/><br/>The third option - depicting a world in which sexism exists - is what I take the opening quote to be about. Once you learn to notice this property of your proposed fictional universe, you are making a choice to keep it that way. It's not a forbidden choice. It's just, is it important to you, to your story, that the societal injustice is aligned precisely with your picture of the past? Is there merit in changing things around to provide inspiration for those currently suffering injustice? Is there merit in keeping things historically accurate - because of your own enjoyment, that of your audience, or for educational purposes? The point is, you're making a choice.<br/><br/>Just dropping "historical accuracy" is a bit of a cop-out answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442299/#Comment_442299" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-30T14:29:08+00:00" title="January 30, 2015  2:29PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2015 2:31PM by AsIf.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">@JonatanK</a> - What about "Cultural accuracy"?  "Psychological accuracy"?  "Genealogical accuracy"?  I'm curious what you think about those.<br/><br/>(The below is not a direct answer to JonatanK, but an example for the group to consider.)<br/><br/>For my long-running AD&amp;D world, I spent a lot of time (actually went back to school and majored in anthropology) in order to present a highly detailed analog for every Earth culture in what I called its "highest pre-industrial form".  When I say detailed, I mean that I developed whole genealogies for the current cultures by conceiving and mapping the movements and interminglings of their predecessor cultures, many of them dead, thousands of years prior to the time of the campaign, all the way back to the neolithic stage.  I did the same for languages and major technologies, mapping flowcharts of descended concepts which modeled those of Earth in terms of content but flowed along different paths than those they took on Earth.  These models of cultural change, divergence, warfare and absolution were as detailed and necessary (to my mind) as the models I built for ocean currents, trade winds, climatic zones, tectonic plates, etc.<br/><br/>Point that should be clear from the above is that was not actually <i>historical</i> accuracy I went for; it was more about developing a set of cultural <i>genealogies</i> that mapped closely to those of Earth.<br/><br/>While I kept the cultures distinct and fairly separate from each other, it was not unheard of to encounter people of a culture, skin color, religious cult, etc, different from one's own, and it was <i>very</i> common for a person of one culture to generally distrust those of others, and sometimes to the point of hatred, which of course would be an example of diegetic racism.<br/><br/>As for inequality, it certainly existed among the cultures as well as within them, but at the same time, each culture had its own region of control in which its own customs were the dominant idea.  The general separation (mostly geographical in nature), allowed me to create isolationist models of high cultural accuracy within each region, and allow the players to make up their own minds about how to perceive them, while creating NPC examples of both kindly color-blind diplomats and ragingly chauvinistic assholes of every known human type.  Because that's the full range of real humans, like it or not, and it's older than recorded time.<br/><br/>Did the world have racism in it?  Fuck yeah!<br/>Does that fact make me a racist?

We've been doing things from similar inspirations a lot around here over the last few years, and I have to say that a lot of the social, economic, religious material just plain wouldn't make sense with a clumsy Star Trek morality lathered on top. Not that I wouldn't be interested in seeing somebody try running the Italian Wars milieu in a world with absolute gender and racial equality... but anyway, the point was that despite this big historical fiction kick, nearly all people I play with are committed liberal humanists of one or other flavour, and a significant minority are actually politically committed to this shit, working actively for say refugee integration, sexual minority rights or whatever. It'd just be plain ignorance to assume that we enjoy a grim historical setting because of how nicely it massages our personal convictions about medieval mores.<br/><br/>I do think that I get the point of the original quote - it's saying that historical realism is not a justification per se, not unless you're also willing to man up and own your artistic goals. I just don't think that the artistic goals are often very wile, people are ascribing much too nefarious motives to ordinary gamers.

It's an ill-considered approach, trying to brow-beat people into including a party line in all of their creations in an effort to force specific values into the culture.

The delusion that the fictional stuff is real and happening of its own accord is an extremely productive one.<br/><br/>Once the creating is all <i>done</i>, then yeah, attempting to deny responsibility is simply a cop-out.<br/><br/>I think Hudson's quote makes most sense as a reaction to <i>bad art</i>, which risks nothing by simply being re-created without the icky bits.  If she were talking about <i>good</i> art, though, the claim that "the only reason something happens in a story is that the writer chooses it" is superfluous at best, willfully ignorant at worst.  There's a reason why there's a racist black cop in Boyz N the Hood, rooted in the world the film portrays, and to suggest that Singleton could simply have portrayed that world differently is to suggest that he make less honest and less relevant art.<br/><br/>I did like Eero's take, though, so at least we can agree on that.<br/><br/>Separately, I think there are different thresholds for racism, sexism, etc. in finished works which audiences consume as opposed to roles which players inhabit.  I would be much more comfortable writing a fantasy novel in which villagers are skeptical of female adventurers than I would be in publishing a fantasy game in which female players actually have to deal with that.  I'm all for including the shitty human behavior that makes a fictional world plausible, but I'm not for putting real-world players on the receiving end of it unless they actively want that themselves.

I mean, in a way, "I want to write about historical [whatever period], racism, sexism and all, and don't flinch" can definitely be a valid choice. If that's what happened, then "historical accuracy" is not just a cop-out excuse. It becomes a cop-out when the thought process stops there. When someone asks you "hey, why does it have to be the man that leaves his home and saves the kingdom while his sister stays behind, and not the other way around" and you answer "well, historically that's more plausible" it kind of suggests that your thought process <i>stops there</i>. That's what I'm calling the cop-out.<br/><br/>Because of this, your particular case of lining up pseudo-fictional cultures, genealogies, and going "an accurate depiction of what I think real human beings would do in this situation includes racism", well, that's miles more informed and justified in my eyes.<br/><br/>In the end it comes down to being aware of the choices you're making, and, if you care about people questioning you, showing that awareness.<br/><br/>(This isn't the whole story though - the points about creators losing themselves in their own ficition, and gamers doing the same, not viewing themselves as creators in the moment, are really good ones as well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
