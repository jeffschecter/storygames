Amongst them; me.<br/><br/>Today I tested GMing it, to prepare for a spring-campaign. Very useful to have a single session on my back, before venturing into the grand epic.</i><br/><br/>The session went well, even though I did not have the method all in my head and in my fingers.<br/><br/>The games it easy for you to create something that functions. I really like the simple scenario-structure. Looking forward to exploring it further, in campaign mode. There may be some golden gaming laying in wait for me and my players ...<br/><br/>The game encourages a social/hierarchical/political use of NPCs, something I am really fond of. The atmosphere of the game is supportive of social interplay, both between characters and with NPCs. It seems to lend itself to intrigues, feuding and revenge-motifs. <br/><br/>Creating characters is a bit time-consuming, in my view, but it is certainly geared towards useful characterization, giving the players useful choices all the way, without taxing them too much. With easy means the players define their characters very nicely, and ready themselves for playing them. It was interesting to see how their initial character.concepts grew and solidified during the process.<br/><br/>The nine conflict-types that is defined in the game, gives me, the GM, a broad range of conflicts which is easy to transfer into actual play, giving the game a nice potential for variation. In my small test today, I set up the finale as a conflict of argument, and it turned into a really nice climax of the scenario. <br/><br/>The game is open in form. That is; it encourages that the GM serve the players with hints on secrets and intrigues, giving them ample stuff to work on and a sound basis to know "what is really going on", even if their characters don't succeed in revealing anything of substance. I really like this, as it is in less danger of leaving players out in the dark, with no knowledge (or appreciation) of the heart of the drama. The rule of "binding results" is a really nice tool in this respect; even though YOU know this is wrong, you character don't, and so you are bound to act up to it. Most players I know love this kind of "I really know it, but my character don't, and so I must play him loyal to his beliefs".<br/><i><br/>I am really looking forward to my spring-campaign. It will be in Norwegian, with my own maps (based on the woods where I live) and hand-drawn char-sheet, and central parts of the text translated. I can smell a grand epic brewing, an epic of war and conspiracy amongst mice, and revenge ...</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
