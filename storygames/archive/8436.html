What tricks have you used that really drove good play?  What should we look out for?  I've played Polaris in one-shot mode several times, and two of us played TABAW at a convention once as well, but that's the limit of our actual play experience with either game.<br/><br/>Thanks for your hard-earned advice!  I'll keep a running tally, because I hope to get a lot of good ideas:\n<ul>\n<li>Hearts: resist the temptation to "Darth Vader" - remember that your characters are supposed to be good guys! I've played a few games where one character went to the dark side fast and hard and without much attempt to stay good. Darth Vader syndrome isn't so much a problem in Polaris, which has no defined end point. But in TABAW, if one character is pushing experience much, much faster than other characters it winds up having the effect of that character hogging the story. It also makes the ending not so satisfying for the other players, because they don't get a chance to struggle with fate.</li>\n<li>Really make big statements. If you want something, state that you get it, and the Mistake will bargain it back.</li>\n<li>But don't just start up scenes and start dropping big statement-bombs.  Take your time.</li>\n<li>Don't view the ritual negotiation as a vehicle for making fictional contributions better or more awesome, rather than a method for mediating between different player contributions to arrive at a consensus.</li>\n<li>Respect the ritual elements of game play</li>\n<li>As the Infidel, State something awful and wait for the poor Heart player to say "You ask me far too much...". Then bring forward your hard hitting statement. Your second statement has to be lesser OR different, remember </li>\n<li>As the Mistaken, be cruel. Find the point where you can most hurt the Heart and then hurt him there.</li>\n<li>As the Moons, take sides. You can put pressure on the Heart or Mistaken by using your characters to assist one side. If you can persuade your allied player that your character's actions are helpful, then you can get your ally to "See What Will Come Of It" when the other player tries to wave it off with "But It Was No Matter"</li>\n<li>Play the game hard by advocating hard for your side.</li>\n<li>Do hold grudges.</li>\n<li>Do have an aesthetic sense that tells you when it's time to ignore all of the above advice. But, as a default, do play hard.</li>\n<li>Each player should show up with a Bang to toss at the protagonist for whom he is the Infidel.</li>\n<li>The moons should act as hecklers as well as cheerleaders - Seth</li>\n<li> As a moon you should align your interests with either the Heart or Mistaken in a given scene. - Seth</li>\n<li>Every Knight will eventually betray the people unless he dies first. So, once your Knight clicks over to Veteran, you should be angling to get your Knight to die before he betrays that which he loves. -Seth</li>\n<li>As Infidel, you can make the pursuit of a tragic death very very hard - Seth</li>\n<li>The rivalry between Heart and Mistaken drives the game, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. -Seth</li>\n<li>when you are the Mistaken, be a jerk. I don't mean that you should be cruel to the other player, but you should be as cruel as possible to the character. Show no mercy. -Seth </li>\n<li>he game is about the Heart characters, so, in some way, make it obvious why the Moon characters are not protagonists. Their lives are not full of tragedy, they're full of something a bit less noble.</li>\n<li>As Infidel, consider that the Christians may be the good guys.</li>\n<li>Once you get a handle on how conflict works (and only after that) you can use incompleted statements in really fun ways. For instance, say that you and I are about to have a sword fight, and I want to draw it out. I could just say "I cut off your head" and negotiated from there. That's fine, and legal. But I could also say "I swing my sword at you" which in this case is an invitation for you to block or dodge my sword swing without going into conflict.</li>\n<li>After you have played a touch, look at "Song of Truth." Consider the ramifications.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186480/#Comment_186480" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T06:15:59+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  6:15AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really make big statements.  If you want something, state that you get it, and the Mistake will bargain it back.  This is sort of different from how some other games encourage asking for very small things and building those up into big things.<br/><br/>If you just say "I try to do X", then the Mistake can't do anything about it, nor can anyone else.  It's only once you say "I do X, which has Y and Z effect" that people can start invoking ritual phrases and such.<br/><br/>That's been the hardest thing to learn and do in our Polaris game.  It's advice that's in the book, but it really is important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186483/#Comment_186483" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T06:40:36+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  6:40AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think formal negotiation systems, like the unstructured negotiation that happens constantly in most roleplaying, can cause problems when players approach the negotiation system as a method for making fictional contributions better or more awesome, instead of as a method for mediating between different player contributions to arrive at a consensus.  I have definitely been in Polaris games in which players regularly used "but only if" and "and also" to escalate the scope and potency of actions, to the point where things got ridiculous and disconnected from the emotions of the players.  We killed an army of invading demons with an opera, sure, but, while that is a cool thing <i>to have done</i>, it wasn't satisfying to pull off in play, because it was merely the result of a "but only if" statement and not something that we progressed towards. You can have similar issues in the post-conflict resolution in In A Wicked Age, often as a result of spending too much time negotiating a result that satisfies both players.  In both cases, negotiation can run the danger of killing the freshness and immediacy of play.<br/><br/>To avoid such things, I think it's important, perhaps, to run a few example conflicts (maybe in the form of those pre-game training conflicts in Dogs initiations, so they actually have some relevance to the game) and build a shared sense of the social boundaries of negotiation, as well as just the strictly mechanical ones.  Ideally, I think, negotiation should happen relatively quickly and not drag on with more and more conditions added on to the resolution.  Just like a bill trying to work it's way through congress, the potency of the initial declaration is often diminished by each additional clause added, especially if the clauses seem unrelated to the original point.  Sure, it's important to engage in some negotiation, because that's the whole point of the system, but make sure the negotiation is focused on the original declaration and the consequences thereof.  If everybody understands that, it should rock.<br/><br/>I have some other thoughts about how the moons work, but I'll let other people comment first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186485/#Comment_186485" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T06:51:13+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  6:51AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>Really make big statements.</blockquote>\nAgreed, but *build up to them*.

Moon characters should have their own agendas that are petty, immature, greedy, etc.  The game is about the Heart characters, so, in some way, <i>make it obvious why the Moon characters are not protagonists</i>.

That's what I get for not checking in. There's a lot of fantastic advice that pretty much covers most of what I'd say, so I'll just note something specific to TABAW:<br/><br/>Hearts: resist the temptation to "Darth Vader" - remember that your characters are supposed to be good guys! I've played a few games where one character went to the dark side fast and hard and without much attempt to stay good. Darth Vader syndrome isn't so much a problem in Polaris, which has no defined end point. But in TABAW, if one character is pushing experience much, much faster than other characters it winds up having the effect of that character hogging the story. It also makes the ending not so satisfying for the other players, because they don't get a chance to struggle with fate.<br/><br/><br/>Let me know how the game goes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187021/#Comment_187021" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T20:07:43+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  8:07PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to interrupt...<br/><br/>I just checked over at IPR and <i>Thou Art But A Warrior</i> is not in stock.<br/><br/>Is there any place to buy it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187056/#Comment_187056" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T04:24:46+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  4:24AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>Let me know how the game goes!</blockquote>\nWe definitely will, Anna!

Now, that's not your statement, obviously. If we were playing Polaris, it might be "But Only If you cut down your superior officer in cold blood" or "But Only If you spare the demon's life". And, remember that you can always tag an experience check onto a Heart as part of negotiations, in addition to any that the Heart would earn from his actions.<br/><br/>Also, remember the power of manipulating the Heart through "You Ask Far Too Much". Here's how this works:<br/><br/>1) Ask for something really awful that the Heart won't want to do that you'd like to have happen.<br/><br/>2) Wait for the Heart to say "You Ask Far Too Much".<br/><br/>3) Say the <i>other</i> really awful thing that you'd actually really like to have happen.<br/><br/>4) Watch the Heart sweat.<br/><br/>(Can you tell that I really like playing the Mistaken?)<br/><br/>Also, remember that most of the really powerful statements (e.g. "And Furthermore...", "You Ask Far Too Much", and the like) require exhausting an Aspect. Eventually, if you're hammering hard enough, the Heart will want to take an Experience check just on the off-chance of picking up a refresh.<br/><br/>Finally, remember that failing an "It Shall Not Come To Pass" roll earns the Heart an Experience check.<br/><br/>Of course, if you're still getting a feel for the system, it can be hard to see how you can pull dirty tricks like these. But, this is what I meant by playing hard. That aesthetic sense that I mentioned needs to come into play <i>after</i> you internalize the lessons about being truly cruel to the Heart.<br/><br/>Here's an example:<br/><br/>Raquel was playing Bellatrix. Through various manipulations of yours truly, Bellatrix was pregnant with a demon child. For reasons that I don't remember right now, Bellatrix eventually decided to try to kill the child within her. So she drew her sword and stabbed herself in the stomach to kill the child. I used "And Furthermore..." to get out of that particular mess. This eliminated "But Only If..." as a reply...which meant that I also eliminated her possibility of asking for death. Yes, she was a Veteran, but Veterans only die when the Heart says, "But Only If I die." And I took that away.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying this just because I'm sadistic. (Maybe that's true, though....) But, unless the Mistaken gives the Heart something to push against, the Heart's story will be the poorer for it.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188042/#Comment_188042" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T08:16:25+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  8:16AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe part of the problem was that it's too early for anybody to have investment in secondary characters?

There's a list of things knights can and cannot do and we went through it point by point after each scene.  Usually there was at most one point where the PC was in variance.  One time there were three, but that was as crazy as it got.  Here's an example:  I set up a scene where Clinton's guy discovers that his wife is having an affair with a Muladi knight who is in his Infidel area of the cosmos.  He confronts the guy.  End result - they are cast out of Cordoba, the Muladi "and his whore", after Clinton's guy discovers that they are both closet Christians.  So none of the restrictions about dealing with Muslims apply, given his range of options he treated them with mercy, and so forth.  Most of the scenes went this way - people took conservative courses of action.  My guy defied the Emir (ka-ching) to go find his kidnapped son, but that was the only point in which he was in variance with the precepts - treating the Emir with discourtesy.  Remi's guy watched his wife and son be butchered by Christians rather than go back on his vow of pacifism, which was pretty awesome.  He got dinged for not respecting things under his responsibility or something - one item on the list - and got what he wanted out of the conflict (driving the Christians away without fighting).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188076/#Comment_188076" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T10:17:51+00:00" title="January 13, 2009 10:17AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we played TABAW, we usually treated the forbidden acts as a menu from which to choose what to do in a scene (I know I did, anyway), so we had tons of experience checks.

If you're getting experience, just not much, that's fine. It puts you on track for a 4-6 session game. Which is not a bad case.<br/><br/>So the code of conduct in Polaris (TABAW I think is likewise the case) is not coherent. There are many situations where even the most conservative knight will necessarily violate one or the other. I can't figure out how to do it with TABAW because I don't have the code points memorized, but my favorite one in Polaris is when your lover is possessed by a Demon. If you treat her like a demon, that's callousness. If you treat her like your lover, that's sympathy for a Demon. And if you give up, that's despair. Lose-lose-lose.<br/><br/>In the case you're talking about, there's probably an analogue to apostasy (a Muslim who "converts" to Christianity is an apostate, but not "no longer a Muslim."

But then in the second session we were all understanding our roles and the games and the story better, and lots of shit happened and it was more satisfying.  And lots more experience was rolled.  <br/><br/>So this might just be a normal part of the learning the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188108/#Comment_188108" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T12:13:26+00:00" title="January 13, 2009 12:13PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason:<br/><br/>So in my head, there exists three different versions of the game. <br/><br/>1) There's the long-form, in which people play characters who are genuinely good people who try to hold on to their convictions despite being put in a situation where it's not possible to do so. This features slow but inexorable experience advancement as the Infidel continues to force the Heart to make tough choices one by one. This version is probably my favorite.<br/><br/>2) There's the short-form, in which people play characters who initially struggle to hold on to their convictions before giving up in the face of overwhelming odds. This usually starts out with people excercising restraint and holding on to their code, then at some point saying 'fuck it' and pursuing personal agendas while the kindgdom burns around them. This is satisfying too, but very different from the long form.<br/><br/>3) Then there's the con game, in which people push as hard as humanly possible to try to force an ending in just a couple of hours. A lot of Darth Vadering usually happens in con games. This can be fun, but bears almost no resemblance to the first version.<br/><br/><br/>I suppose that would have been a good thing to articulate in the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188114/#Comment_188114" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T12:40:21+00:00" title="January 13, 2009 12:40PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're definitely going for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188129/#Comment_188129" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T13:56:49+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  1:56PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are we?
