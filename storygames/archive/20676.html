Ayway, one thing took me to the other and got me thinking into this idea:<br/><br/>Players list different bonds and relationships on their character sheet. On some games there give you mechanical bonuses, on some Jrpgs you even burn these relationships to get those bonuses as a mechanic contraption to show how your character loses her humanity each time they go. But what I'd like to try is just having players roll as many death saves as bonds their characters have with the world round them.<br/><br/>So, in the end it's more like, what reasons doesn your character has to go on? Is it because of that promise he made to their teacher? Is it because someone has to get your fellow party members out of this?<br/><br/>I'd even let players come up with their own reasons to live instead of, well, kinda punishing them at those moments for not having enough bonds. While it would be cool to see them develop bonds through the game it isn't too good to have them do it decause otherwise they will have less death saves. So, perhaps just letting come up with reasons on the spot and letting everyone in advance of this ruling should be enough.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453907/#Comment_453907" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T23:31:27+00:00" title="June 16, 2016 11:31PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2016 11:32PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The mechanical version seems fine, potentially interesting. The 'make them up on the spot' version sounds disastrous and exhausting. <br/><br/>A sufficiently motivated player could presumably come up with dozens of such reasons, and if not then you are just punishing them for a lack of spontaneous imagination -- if this sort of player-based evaluation is part of your approach to play, I guess that could be ok, but personally I would find this sort of mechanic pretty awful. And I say that as someone in the 'could make up dozens of reasons if it really felt necessary' club.<br/><br/>If the goal is simply to always give people a bit of a chance, I would suggest allowing players to make up ONE new reason on the spot -- this seems much more reasonable, both mechanically and fictionally, as you can easily imagine a character who _thought_ they had nothing to live for suddenly realizing, as they lie there bleeding out, that -- no wait! -- they actually really need to visit their mother's grave one last time, or tell that NPC how much they love them, or see the sunset, or take vengeance on the Lich King, or swim in the lake by their summer home, or...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453908/#Comment_453908" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T00:49:25+00:00" title="June 17, 2016 12:49AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2016 5:59AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love this idea.

That's your motive to live? Ok, then go chase it!
