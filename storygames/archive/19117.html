I see your dilemma.<br/><br/>Exclude Jimmie Joan, of course. Specifically, were I Billy Sue, I'd explain to Jimmie Joan why it's not a good idea for them to hang. Note that adult people have no problems with something like this: it is completely routine for us to be accepting and agreeable about the fact that <i>I</i> am not the one who decides who <i>you</i> invite in your project, birthday party or whatever. This goes double for when there are goals and reasoning involved.<br/><br/>Not being willing to do this smacks of cowardice to me, of being unwilling to accept that somebody somewhere might potentially not like you. Billy Sue needs to accept that either they're friends with Jimmie Joan despite not sharing this community, or they won't be friends because JJ can't accept being excluded. It's not Billy Sue's responsibility to be the guardian of Jimmie Joan's feelings.<br/><br/>I say this with full understanding of the fact that I am, for many potential communities, Jimmie Joan <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> On the other hand, I am often also Billy Sue, and I've learned to exclude ruthlessly (yet hopefully nicely) in direct proportion to the importance of my goals. For example: the more serious my ambitions are for a given roleplaying game, the more ruthless I am in choosing a player base who can actually execute those ambitions. Jimmie Joan gets to play with me when I'm playing something that suits them, or when I'm playing something casual where I don't care if it'll work; however, they are not welcome if their participation would derail the entire reason we had for getting together in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426688/#Comment_426688" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T14:46:27+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  2:46PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "A fun community for everyone" smacks of Geek Social Fallacy to me.

I set up London Indie RPG and, thank goodness, we've had some great people join and our community is still growing.  There has been very little dickish behaviour with only a couple of exceptions.  The first time it happened someone chose to carry out a personal attack on me in my role as organiser on an internet forum.  A lot of the people there meet up IRL and this person was called out by that community as well as London Indie RPG regulars.<br/><br/>They then dropped out of said forum.  Almost a year later they tipped up at the group as if nothing had happened.  I was speechless.  A couple of months later they left the group during the opening pitches as the game they wanted to run did not run because we prioritise new people choosing the game they want to play first.  A new person turned me and asked if they'd done something wrong in their choosing.  I said, "No, 'Jimmie Joan' is just being a dick."  Actually I might have said "arsehole."<br/><br/>As Eero said I could play some fluff with Jimmie Joan for 3 or 4 hours but I'd never do anything longer or deeper with him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426693/#Comment_426693" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T15:29:16+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  3:29PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, <a href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">@Matthijs</a>, this sounds very close to home, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Can we clarify something?

I mean, I'm doing this for my principles, right? Then staying true to my principles is more important than the community being "successful" by any other meter. You've got to take a stand and, if it comes to it, suffer for your beliefs. If I kick J.J., I fail. If I stand firmly by my principles, I succeed. Thus, not only I'm not gonna kick J.J. but, in fact, in order to improve my chances at "succeeding" (by staying firmly my ground) I'm not gonna police this community <i>at all</i>. Fuck, I'm not even gonna build a "kick" function into it!<br/><br/>If the point of it all, OTOH, is to have a place that I like, then I'd make it crystal-clear since the beginning that it's ultimately <i>my</i> place. Then I'll be super-welcoming and extra-kind to everybody, because that's part of how I like it. But if someone annoys me, I have no qualms about showing them the door. Of course, before doing that I'd try to sort it out with them, 'cause I might be wrong about them, and I'd really like it if I could be friends with everybody, etc. But if I really end up disliking J.J. \u2014 disliking them myself, not nurturing some abstract and theoretical "somebody might dislike them" thought \u2014 if I really grow to think they're making my place worse, I'll show them the door, in the end. And won't need any principle or rule to do that: it's my place, I tell them I don't like it to have them hanging around, tell them to go, and I don't care how they react as long as, in the end, they go. I need no justification except that it's my place, and I believe conjuring up razionalizations is gonna hurt the community in the long run.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426729/#Comment_426729" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T21:00:14+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  9:00PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, as long as you're upfront about what the expectations are nobody can complain too much about it.<br/><br/>But, here is where it gets tricky in my view.

Being "open to everybody" and being functionally egalitarian are different things. Rafu is discussing the former, and it <i>is</i> a matter of principle, not an endless series of iterative responsibilities over the mental states of other people.<br/><br/>It's like this: you're saying that being "open to everybody" necessarily has to include handicap-accessibility. I think that this is an unsupported reading of the idea of public, open space, considering the cultural history we have for the concept - of course we can define words however we want, but handicap-accessibility, topic-sensitive censorship and other similar active inclusiveness measures are not traditional parts of public space, at least in European tradition. They may be nice to have, but saying that your space is not open to everybody if it doesn't fulfill these new requirements is essentially raising the threshold for something being called "open".<br/><br/>(In case it's unclear what <i>is</i> part of the cultural history of open, public spaces, my own understanding is that we essentially have to look at the shared norms of civilized behaviour, as encoded in tradition and law. From this we see that things like non-aggression, individual rights and freedom of speech are given elements of the rules for public forums, while various types of actively egalitarian measures are not. Whether for good or ill, the cultural tradition understands "openness" as "open to equal participation by the average baseline person, even if this might shut out people with special needs".)<br/><br/>Of course Matthijs might have originally meant something more radically egalitarian and inclusive by this hypothetical open community, but that's besides the analytical point. I just wanted to show how Rafu's viewpoint about principles-first openness can be entirely sensible, and how it doesn't make a community less "open" if it interprets the ideal of openness in that way instead of Quincunx's way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426799/#Comment_426799" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T14:59:36+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  2:59PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dicks aren't the hardest. You can always tell what they're doing wrong, and show them the door if they don't believe. And you won't feel too bad doing it, because the person was a dick. <br/><br/>No, a far worse problem are people who just aren't in the groove at all. Something like younger siblings. Often they don't have another close community and they really want to belong to this one, which not only makes them both too clingy and hard to kick out. You don't want to make the guy feel bad, but being with him is a chore. Mind you, I'm not saying that people like that should always be kicked out, the specific context is important here. <br/><br/>My dad's advice for me was that if I really want an exclusive club with handpicked members with that special chemistry, I should mostly shut up about it in public.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426806/#Comment_426806" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T15:51:44+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  3:51PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs,<br/>  I'd like to support the idea of making the undesirable behavior against the rules of the group, rather than making the person against the rules of the group.<br/>  Not out of a desire to please all people all the time, but for two reasons:<br/>1) Give that person a chance, maybe with this constraint they will be worthwhile to have<br/>2) Head off people that you don't know are a problem yet.<br/>  The hard part is, you have to enforce it with a draconian vigor or it is just a tool to pick on Jimmie...<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
