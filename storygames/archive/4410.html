And very nice it is too.  It has, as people who might be familiar with it as a product, absolutely no gaming stats or anything in it at all.  It's completely systemless.  Which is ace, because there's a pretty high chance that no matter what system it'd been written for, It'd probably be one I don't like.<br/><br/>So here I am, having not really had a chance to read or look at it and thinking that there are a few ways I can put it to use.  Mainly:<br/><br/>1) Run it with Savage Worlds.  Two out of the three players in my group have played Savage Worlds before and know the system.  The third player will have zero problems with it.  I've run it before, know it and like it.  It works well for a certain type of game.  This is far and away the easiest option.<br/><br/>2) Thing is, I kinda want to try some of the stuff that's in Burning Wheel.  But the down sides are that I'd be trying to get them to play what is actually a pretty fiddly system which I have to admit I've never really felt I completely understand.  So there will/would be a lot of learning for everybody involved.  Another concern is that perhaps the lifepaths will not entirely fit with the Freeport setting, although I haven't looked into that properly.  This will produce a different game, one which will be interesting but not necessarily better and definitely a whole lot more work for me and everyone else involved.<br/><br/>3) Or I try to drift some of the niftier things about Burning Wheel, probably Beliefs and Instincts into Savage Worlds.  SW already has the Bennies currency which would hook quite nicely into this as well as the Hindrance mechanic which I can see becoming something along the lines of SotC's negative use of Aspects (Compels?).  Probably as much work for me as using BW straight up, but much easier on the players.<br/><br/>So, anyone who knows BW, SW and Freeport got anything to add?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
