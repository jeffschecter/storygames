Thank you so much everyone. The instant support, creativity and awesomeness shared thus far has shocked and astounded me. Truly! This thread was seriously the little push I needed to get this thing rolling. I feel all warm and fuzzy inside from my favorite online community. And just in time for the holidays. Aw. Thanks guys. You rock.<br/><br/>I really appreciate all the different kinds of feedback, from detailed fictional concepts to the types of systems things I could look into to the simple game design advice. I'm really glad that the one sentence of ideas I wrote in the original post (the hook, I suppose you could call it) sounded so intriguing to everyone. And the advice to use that in my design is a really good idea, it'll keep me on track. You guys are totally right, I don't need to poll the internet, I guess it just feels good to have some affirmation. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I should work on this goddamn game.<br/><br/>It'll definitely be a labor of love. I dunno what it is, of all the things in fiction and storytelling I love, I feel the most attached to cyborgs. From terminators to cylons, Alphonse in fullmetal alchemist to Rei Toei in Idoru. But, I dunno Luke, that Commando game looks frightening. I'm not sure I love cyborgs THAT much. I'll try anything once though, so you're on!<br/><br/>So, I guess keep your eye out for some badass sexy cyborgs. It won't be top secret, if I have design questions I'll probably post those too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304833/#Comment_304833" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T09:13:28+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  9:13AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, you might consider checking out the Praxis/Game Design forum here.

Police. The latter really deals with the dirty, sexy, monstrous, nasty, illegal, and painful parts of cyborgs.<br/><br/>...and somewhere in the back of my head is some male voice, lamenting his new metal body...<br/><br/>oh, yeah, it was Metallo, from the Superman animated series.

I can't believe how much I fell in love with this series. The movie has always been a classic in my library, but I always thought the anime was kinda cheesy till I sat down and watched it all on netflix. But you totally hit on something I'm giving some big consideration... I think I'm going to use the "cyborg" definition in lots of different ways, metaphorically and physically. I would consider all the characters in the Ghost in the Shell series cyborgs, cause they all have neural nets. Part man, part machine.

Both his parents had cybernetic implants. So even though he didn't have any, he still identified as a cyborg. <br/><br/>Identity and change are indeed sexy, crazy fun stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera" title="XanatosChimera"><img alt="XanatosChimera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera">XanatosChimera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307506/#Comment_307506" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-09T07:56:02+00:00" title="January  9, 2011  7:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exploring cyborg/non-cyborg identity can also touch on themes and ideas tied to gender identity vs gender morphology.  A heavily cyberised individual may think of themselves as human while Seven of Nine after being severed from the collective and only having the essential cybernetics for survival from the Borg conversion identifies as Borg most of the time while Picard (it's never made clear if he has any implants left from his time as Locutus, he does have the artificial heart though), identifies as human.  Both Picard and Seven/Annika have similar cyberisation levels and both depend on cybernetics for survival (cybernetic heart in the former, and nano-tech in the latter).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307693/#Comment_307693" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T13:57:52+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  1:57PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2011 2:10PM by Wordman.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just assuming that anyone writing a game about anskty, sexy, badass cyborgs has seen <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_(film)" rel="nofollow">Nemesis</a> half a dozen times, but it pays to be sure.

Personally, I've always dug the <i>internal conflicts</i> that cybernetic stories deal with. What does it mean to be human and what does it mean to be a machine? I love watching a character struggle with those ideas, and act on what they think is the best.<br><br>I envision some kind of sliding scale, and the actions you take move you closer to either humanity or machine.<br/><br/>Rather than full-on cyborgs, I think taking the cybernetic augmentation approach would make for more interesting conflicts. You could play up the decision to stay as "human" as possible, and then play up even more the decision to finally get a modification. I imagine a dramatic scene of a defiant character tearing out a cyber-eye or some such thing, and another scene where a character full of grim determination gets the last augment he needs to finally achieve some goal. Like the boxer who finally breaks down and gets cyber-arms like everyone else. I'm reminded of R.A.X. Coswell from the game <i>Eternal Champions.</i><br/><br/>So, in short, I'd play it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307755/#Comment_307755" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-11T06:18:05+00:00" title="January 11, 2011  6:18AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>I'm just assuming that anyone writing a game about anskty, sexy, badass cyborgs has seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_(film)" rel="nofollow">Nemesis</a> half a dozen times, but it pays to be sure.</blockquote>\nLester, you took the words right out of my mouth.  I was thinking that if someone wanted to do a cyborg game that didn't cover the same well-trodden ground that <i>Cyberpunk</i> and <i>Shadowrun</i> have, looking to something like <i>Nemesis</i> wouldn't be a half-bad idea, especially with its exploration of the difference between people who've turned themselves into machines and machines that have turned themselves into people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307758/#Comment_307758" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-11T07:14:31+00:00" title="January 11, 2011  7:14AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2011 8:05AM by Suna.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All has already been said what should have been said.<br/>Could you please start a brainstorming phase in the praxis forum, if you already haven't? If you have, please link. I'm curious. There's lots of fiction, games (not only rpgs) about cyborgs, but it depends on how you decline your idea. Yeah like it was a verb. Cyborging. Sorry, that sounds horrible.<br/>So it's about the duality human vs. cyborg.  Cool. Cyberpunk 2020 ridiculously failed at approaching the theme, so it would be a great thing if we had a game focusing on that aspect and succeeding in making it cool.<br/>What sort of story would you like to create through your game? What aspects will it privilege? What do characters do in your game?<br/>Please do go on.<br/>Oh and. An advice I've been given. Don't be obsessed with originality.
