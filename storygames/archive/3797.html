It's written by a psychologist who suffered from schizophrenia for ten years. Among other things, she talks about how schizophrenic hallucinations can serve different purposes: They are manifestations of problems and emotions that the sufferer has trouble coping with - but they can also be tools, strategies for getting what you want, be it much-needed attention or freedom from chores.<br/><br/>It made me think about "Under the Bed", and how the child's toys can all be seen as strategies for the child to use in difficult situations - some helpful, some more harmful than helpful.<br/><br/>Perhaps it could be interesting to play a variant where the child is a schizophrenic (probably in his/her teens), and the toys are hallucinations? <br/><br/>The problem, of course, is that while the toys in UtB always want what's best for the child in a harmful situation, the hallucinations are often manifestations of the harmful situation itself.

So, for instance, if one hallucination is going "they're all possessed by demons! you can't trust them! you have to run away and never speak to her again!" that's still a coping strategy, and functional for a conflict in Under the Bed.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
