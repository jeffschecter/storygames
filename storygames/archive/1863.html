                    So, it seems that the small press/indie games scene in the UK and Ireland isn't quite as vibrant as it is in the US. So what can we as a community do to promote small press stuff, get people playing, talking and designing? Well, a bunch of us here in the UK have got together to set up <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com" rel="nofollow">The Collective Endeavour</a>, a collective (funny that) of small press publishers based in the UK. <br/><br/>So here's our press release spiel...<br/><br/>The Collective Endeavour has been set up by a group of British small-press games publishers to help and promote games design and play.<br/><br/>The Collective Endeavour website (www.collective-endeavour.com) is a place where you can sign up and talk about design, play, conventions and other gaming related things of interest. If youâ€™ve got an idea for a game in your head, want to ask how to publish something youâ€™ve already written, arenâ€™t sure about how to get a games PDF out there or any number of design and publishing related questions, then itâ€™s the ideal place to ask. The founders of the site will always be on hand to help out with questions such as this, as will other site members. And youâ€™re also encouraged to post reports of your actual play experiences: what was fun for you and your group, what made the game cool, what things did you take away from it? Play is the heart of our hobby, and your experiences can help improve the experiences of others.<br/><br/>Weâ€™d love to see people pitch up at the website with a little idea for a game and in six month, a year, or however long it take, have their own game out there in print, PDF or whatever format they chose to distribute it. The Collective Endeavour is there to promote and assist just this kind of thing. On the site youâ€™ll also find blogs, project reports and other notes and queries from the site co-ordinators. The Collective Endeavour will also have a presence at many UK conventions, promoting small-press games.<br/><br/>Who Are The Collective?<br/><br/>After many discussions about small-press publishing in the UK, a number of independent small press games designers came together to form the Collective Endeavour. And they are: Malcolm Craig (Contested Ground Studios), Gregor Hutton (BoxNinja), Andrew Kenrick (Steampower Publishing), Matt Machell (Realms Publishing), Iain McAllister (Contested Ground Studios), Joe J Prince (Prince of Darkness Games).<br/><br/>End of spiel...<br/><br/>Now, please don't feel that this is purely a venue for discussion by those base din the Uk and Ireland. We'd love to make it a place where, like story games, people from all over the place can contribute. However, it's kind of useful for things like publishing, print and production to have a view from our side of the pond, as sometimes things can be a little different over this way.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we'd like to welcome any and all people to come and join the Endeavour. The more support we can get, the bigger a success it will be. Hopefully people will see value in our efforts, not as competition to sites like here, the Forge and RPGnet, but as complementary to the efforts carried out by all these other sites.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>

                            Thanks Jason.<br/><br/>We're hoping that by dint of some effort, we can really raise the profile of small press games in the UK. For example, at Dragonmeet in London next week, we'll be having a stand promoting The Collective Endeavour and small press in general. We'll be selling our own games, but also promoting the small press stuff that our friends at Leisure Games have in stock. So not only will we be running demos of our own games, but we'll also be happy to run demos of other games as well. We'll also have flyers for Indie Press Revolution to further support the cause.<br/><br/>We're aiming to really ramp up the small press presence at UK conventions.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>

                            That's fantastic.  I expect that we can return the favor - grouping UK publishers under a unified banner should make cross-promotion easier, and a nontrivial group of buyers will be particularly interested in seeing what you've been up to.                        </div>

                            I'm really pleased with how things have worked out in the last year or so. We seem to have reached the tipping point of having enough active designers and players to have a solid community in the UK.<br/><br/>Having a single banner to work under should give us an extra level of oomph to promote cool games and get the word out.<br/><br/>2007 should be very interesting.<br/><br/>-Matt                        </div>

                            I've noticed more and more indie games dominating the local cons here in the UK, and this is without any sort of concerted attempt to organise and run events. I think if the Collective can start making appearances at various conventions all over the UK (and beyond!) we can really drive the indie scene forwards on these fair isles.<br/><br/>Can't wait for Dragonmeet! 7 days and counting!                        </div>

                            Very cool guys.  Andrew (Kenrick) has already mentioned the site to me and I've signed up.  I'll also be there at DragonMeet and will be happy to help out (if only to pay Andrew back for running games for me to play ;o) .)                        </div>
