I encourage a lot of "realism" in their characters and therefore run into issues sometimes when one character is going to his kid's recital while the rest of the 'party' investigates a murder scene and otherwise interacts with plot points. Their believable characters believably split up, A LOT, and I hate seeing players left out of interesting or pivotal scenes because their character is off taking care of some solo business.<br/><br/>The Question: What's the best way you've seen to involve Players when their characters aren't involved in the scene? I'm not expecting a definitive answer, but I'd love to hear about some of your favorite methods. What I'm not interested in are PTA-style methods of having the characters "jump into" a scene they aren't otherwise around for. Sometimes, that just doesn't make sense from a narrative standpoint. What I am interested in are different ways that you've seen games handle this particular issue.<br/><br/>When it just doesn't make sense for Joe's character to be here right now, how do we keep Joe involved and entertained until his character shows up again?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212344/#Comment_212344" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T10:25:22+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 10:25AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a couple of options; how well they work depends on the expectations and conventions of the group.<br/><br/>(1) Play opposition. Give the OOS player(s) an NPC "monster" to run. This works best when the NPC's options are clearly delimited: a mook in a combat scene, a walk-on bit part rather than a "boss." Some players will find this unfun if they feel they don't have any real chance to affect the game or the fiction, or represent their character.<br/><br/>(2) Be an active audience. To the extent that some in-game or meta-game resource can be available to be distributed by OOS players (e.g., fan mail), those players can be given the job of recognizing "good form" by the in-scene players. This falls down if any PVP strategizing enters the picture.<br/><br/>(3) Activate sympathetic connections. It may happen that OOS players can be given the ability to introduce some resonant fictional counter-point or actual game-mechanical advantage during play despiter their absence from the scene (via flashback or some other narrative device, perhaps mediated through FATE-like Aspects). "He remembers the training I gave him" is the simplest example. Some may find this phony or prone to abuse.<br/><br/>(4) Play simultaneously. On his or her turn in the "round" the OOS player takes action in his or her scene. This only works when there's enough to do in both locations to warrant such a set-up, and can get complicated quickly. <br/><br/>That's about all I got.

Not just "the barkeep", but Major NPCs. Including protagonists and antagonists.<br/><br/>Sometimes I ply the major NPC once or twice to have the players get a feel for my vision of the character before I "hand them off" to another player who isn't in a scene. But sometimes I'll just as easily hand off a major NPC to a player at the start.<br/><br/>I did this in With Great Power, where the characters were all in the Seattle Night Watch: The first time they met their boss, a powerful (but not Mary Sue) protagonist, I handed the character to a player. Told him "Here's a few things about the Boss: X, Y and Z. Go." and he took on the role with no problem.<br/><br/>If there was anything that I needed (as GM) to happen, like a secret, or a plan, or something, I would make corrections as needed. Like, for the most part I'd turn over major antagonists and protagonists to the players, but if they accidentally said something that directly contradicted my plans, and there wasn't a way to make them commensurable, I'd jump in with a suggestion, or just take over.<br/><br/>Matt (as Boss): "This is the worst thing I've seen since the riots in Cambodia in 1970..."<br/>(and it's really important to my notes, and incommensurable, to have him NOT in Egypt at that time)<br/>Andy: "Ahhh, actually he wasn't in Cambodia, he was in Egypt at that time. That'll be important later."<br/>Matt: "Ah, ok."<br/>(thinking)<br/>Matt: "This is the worst thing i've seen since a string of political assassinations back in Egypt."<br/><br/>or:<br/>Matt (as Boss): "I'll tell you what. Go investigate the murder, and report to me what you find."<br/>Andy: "Ah, actually I've got this part, if it's ok. I've got something in mind"<br/>Matt: "Ah, ok"<br/>(mentally, ownership of the character passes back to Me As GM)<br/>Andy (as Boss): "I'll tell you what, you've had a hard day today, go ahead and get some rest. I sent Alex and Nicodemus to look into the murder, they'll let us know what they find later. Seriously, you need some rest, get the hell out of here."<br/>Other PCs: "Alright, boss."<br/><br/>Just an example of each method.<br/><br/>I love this method, because often the players will come up with things that are<br/>* Unexpected,<br/>* Yet totally work within the framework of the scenario.<br/>That is, my plans for characters and The Story will often change based on the players' portrayal of major NPCs, in a cool way. And yet, if there's something that I just need to have happen (not like constant needling of the players, "Nope, he would say X instead. Nope, he wasn't in Cambodia. Nope, he doesn't know that") and it absolutely cannot change, then I simply either chime in, or I take over.<br/>And if it's possible in the system, I reward the player for taking on a major NPC role for a scene, usually with a Fan Mail style chip or something.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212462/#Comment_212462" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T15:55:29+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  3:55PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the thoughts, all of you.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Play opposition.

The only problem is this game (Orpheus) has a lot of mystery to it so many of the baddies have bizarre abilities and habits that the Players don't quite understand. I'm worried it will take some of the fun out for the players if they start to see the mechanics behind their enemies. Sort of catching the little old man behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Be an active audience.

I really dig the idea, but does it work in a mystery story? If two PCs are interrogating a murder suspect played by another player, is it still fun for that player if I tell him "You're really guilty, but your an excellent liar. Lay it on thick!"

By establishing certain types of NPCs as "examples of the everyday" the players learn to watch those types of NPCs for cues as to how the world/culture normally works. Even if a character isn't involved in a scene, the player can watch for the everyday NPCs to gain insight into the world.<br/><br/>2. Some mysteries are built for the characters to solve, but sometimes I'll create a second mystery behind it, something that isn't necessary to conclude the story, but functions as a puzzle for the players to work through. If they solve it they often get some general insight into how the game world works and establish a good frame of mind for approaching problems within the main plot. To do this the players must be able to listen in on any scene, which isn't appropriate for all types of story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tony%20Pace" title="Tony Pace"><img alt="Tony Pace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tony%20Pace">Tony Pace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212516/#Comment_212516" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T22:34:03+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 10:34PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another possibility, especially when one group engages in combat, is to have the left out players adjudicate the combat while you focus on playing the opposition.

During this fight, though, I'll give you an action point (up to once per round) if you  reveal something about how baron's triumph will undermine family ties, loyalty, and tradition--preferably by showing us something about the baron and his minions in the scene. Also, other PCs can ask you to spend an action point to give them an extra action, but they have to let you establish something about the relationship between the two PCs. Okay?"<br/><br/>The point of this is to keep the player involved by allowing them control of some game-mechanical currency which ebbs and flows based on resonances between the in-scene and off-screen action. It's not full participation, but it's something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212546/#Comment_212546" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T05:39:37+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  5:39AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you've played Houses of the Blooded, you know its resolution system determines whether it is the player or the GM who describes the outcome of an action.

I really dig the idea, but does it work in a mystery story? If two PCs are interrogating a murder suspect played by another player, is it still fun for that player if I tell him "You're really guilty, but your an excellent liar. Lay it on thick!" Does he 'lose' something by knowing too much about the underlying mystery?</blockquote>\nGood question!  It made me think about my situation a little bit more.<br/><br/>So the game I did this heavily in was the With Great Power (rules) game of Night Watch. In Night Watch, there's always something that happens - sometimes even a murder. But the thing is, even though there is definitely a person who did the murder/thing (and they are outed/revealed later), the stories are always about what happens in the wake of that event.<br/><br/>So for example, the campaign began with a murder, a human forced by the hand of a mystery NPC to become an "Other" (a superhuman, in this case a Water-based Mage), and a harbringer of apocalypse arriving in town. The murder was there, but rather than the game being all about the players quizzing the NPCs as to whether they did the deed or not, the game quickly spiraled into a series of events that happened in the Wake of the murder. <br/><br/>So, basically, I had in the back of my head these NPCs in a fictionalized Seattle: The boss of light, the boss of darkness, a few light Others, a few dark Others. In my head, I decided that the conspiracy was all due to the lieutenant/assistant of the Boss of Darkness, and came up with some "puzzle pieces" as to the reasons behind the murder. And yet, I also decided that the characters would not really interact with that character more than once or twice in the entire adventure; Sure, he was the hand behind everything, but he was really not that important to what was happening in the wake of what he did.<br/><br/>Here were my puzzle pieces:<br/>* A harbringer of historic apocalypses (nice girl, but a little skittish) shows up in town. She doesn't have any plans, she just happens to be visiting.<br/>* The characters receive a vision of a natural apocalypse which is going to strike Seattle within the next month.<br/>* Later, they realize the apocalypse is water-based (which cues back to the reasons behind the turning of the Water-Mage character)<br/>* The water mage is being spied upon by some Dark Others, but the Boss of Darkness knew nothing of it.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a lot of other "not mystery plot, but totally interesting" events were going on:<br/>One character, a kind of muse, was having a falling out with her boyfriend, and at the same time was being hunted down by an organization called the Inquisition for things she did a few decades ago.<br/>The other character, a kind of Harry Dresden with No Magic (all trinkets) character was coming to grips with his magical weakness, and a side-story about his paternal grandfather, a liche, trying to steal his body.<br/><br/>As the side-events were wrapping up, and events surrounding the puzzle pieces were put together, only then were the last pieces thrown out:<br/>* The characters learn that whomever set up the murder and water-mage-transform is the same person planning a tidal wave that will hit Seattle in two days.<br/>* The murderer believes that this will lead to the creation of a huge amount of supernaturals ("Others") in one event.<br/>* (and to make the villain sympathetic) the final piece is that the dark others are not planning some "create a bunch of dark others and bum rush the light others" as expected, but rather that the villain's family were killed my humans who couldn't understand them, so he simply wanted to turn all area humans into supernaturals in order for people not to fear the supernatural anymore.<br/><br/>But literally, the characters interacted with that villain twice: Once halfway through the campaign, when they needed to ask him a few questions about Other Events (he was in the city planning hall, and they had old architectural questions for him based on other puzzle pieces). Then, at the end of the scenario, they figure out who was behind the whole mess, and they go to his stronghold and fought him.<br/><br/>So basically, some of those Puzzle Pieces I planned out in advance (the general reason for the murder, why the villain did it, and what the villain's goals were), others were made up later on the fly.<br/><br/><b>BUT, TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT (too late):<br/></b><br/>The important thing wasn't the mystery. I mean, there was a mystery, and I had chosen the villain. And I pawned the villain off on the players when they first met him (to answer those innocuous questions about city architecture), but at the endgame I took the role.<br/>The important thing was what the mystery leads to.<br/>In a nWoD Vampire game, I could see running a similar event. The Prince of the City dies (or could be a peon, something not so groundbreaking). It's not like the PCs are simply going to don hats and magnifying glasses and look for clues: Rather, what's more likely to happen is that the villain had plans; he put events into motion, and the PCs, and everyone, are caught in the whirlwind.<br/><br/>A prince dies. The PCs aren't going to go all Sherlock Holmes on it; I mean, they have interest in finding the killer, and may even be tasked with it. But most likely, the adventure should instead focus on the complications and events that happen next, as three people suddenly vie for power over the vacant throne, and each PC has their own subplot to deal with at the same time... It's like they won't have time to solve the mystery without interruption. They're not going to go from person to person asking "where were you the night of so-and-so?", but rather will be visiting various major NPCs trying to bring stability (or more chaos) to the situation... meanwhile, every now and then a clue is offered to the players, a reason behind the bigger puzzle of Why the person was murdered, rather than Who Did It (which in the end, is far more interesting, right?).<br/><br/>Make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212693/#Comment_212693" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T13:40:10+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  1:40PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>The important thing wasn't the mystery.</blockquote>\nTrue enough Andy. Perhaps my example wasn't quite up to snuff.<br/><br/>In my game, mystery isn't as much a theme as it once was, but the unknown is still incredibly prominent. Let's say a pack of werewolves sneaked (spellcheck just taught me "snuck" isn't a word!) into the city above and are posing as normal humans while they observe the vampires in town. When the PCs bump into these guys while they're using their disguises, can I hand their NPC leader to a free player? Keep in mind that not only would the surprise of their werewolf-ness be better revealed later (in my haughty GM opinion of course), but let's say these PLAYERS have no idea werewolves exist in the game let alone how one would act/react.<br/><br/>I think that's more like what I'm talking about. I feel like handing the sneaky werewolf to a player without enlightening him about the NPCs werewolf-ness will sell the character short while mentioning the werewolf-ness will unnecessarily reveal it to the player. Then again, secrets are only fun when discovered and maybe that'd be sort of a prize for the out of scene player. Your character misses out on the fun, but you as the player get a nifty reveal before the rest of them.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>- Constrained control: Give players specific elements to control.</blockquote>\nThis is <i>exactly</i> the thing I proposed to one of my players last night! My exact words were "I could be the writer/director, while I could leave 'lighting' to you." I'm actually thinking about incorporating Keys into this game anyway. Would it be feasible to grant players (constrained) narrative control over the themes or objects covered by their Keys? Sort of the way Mountain Witch uses Fates?<br/><br/>I have a vision of a trad game where I bring in an NPC villain and his mooks and suddenly Player 3 says "Just as the villain orders the mooks to charge, he pulls a gun and shoots Mook 5 in the back before saying 'I always hated that guy...'" Player 3 can make subtle alterations like that because he has the Key of Betrayal or some such. I love the narrative influence in Mountain Witch and I specifically like the tie-in with Keys. When Player 3 is in the scene it's all about Betrayal, but even when he's out of scene Betrayal can still be a prevalent theme.<br/><br/>I'm sure this needs work though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213075/#Comment_213075" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T03:24:00+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  3:24AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2009 3:24AM by Jarvis.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found a little gem called a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=86779" rel="nofollow">Coolmap</a> in another post. Mike posited that players could be given control over an element on the Coolmap, becoming its 'owner' and introducing or excluding it at will...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>Now, "ownership" of the entities is decided by either informal discussion, a bidding system of some kind, or the use of a limited number of chances in much the same way as the above. "Owning" an entity means that you are, basically, the god, spirit, angel or patron saint of that entity - you are its GM. You can declare anything to be true about it (whole group may veto), and if anyone else wants to declare something true about it they need your approval.</blockquote>\nPerhaps controlling an aspect of the game in this way will be enough to entertain those players. I'll probably try this or the Key method I described previously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213137/#Comment_213137" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T10:26:45+00:00" title="June 18, 2009 10:26AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>They can go and make the tea.</blockquote>Or put them in charge of packing bong hits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
