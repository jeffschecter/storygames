If you don't know me, and that is okay, I am a professional artist. I've never worked for WotC, although I have worked for TSR waaay back in the day. Just wanted to get that disclaimer up.<br/><br/>I just wrote an article addressing WotC's announcement of a "5th" edition Dungeons and Dragons is in the works. My article, Romancing the d20, is aimed at what the art should, could be for upcoming unofficially named "5th" edition. It is on my Live Journal. <br/><br/>I don't pretend to be much of a writer, I am a paint and ink slinger after all. But I do have some passion and emotion about this one. While certainly not an idie or storygame, D&amp;D has had an enormous impact on us, I hope you will take a look.<br/><br/><a href="http://storn-cook.livejournal.com/47531.html" rel="nofollow">http://storn-cook.livejournal.com/47531.html</a><br/><br/>Thank You!!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354598/#Comment_354598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T06:04:50+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  6:04AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2012 2:36PM by jenskot.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I completely agree with, <i>3rd and 4th edition art lost a \u201csense of place\u201d</i>, in general (with exceptions). Strangely many of the artists in D&amp;D 4E are great at depicting sense of place but their skills weren't utilized. D&amp;D Essentials fixed a lot of this but relatively few people have Essentials.<br/><br/>If I was in charge of D&amp;D Next I would utilize an assortment of art styles from artists from every generation of D&amp;D and match the art to the optional rules that best represent that generation. It doesn't even have to stop at optional rules, do this with spells. Have a spell that was introduced in 2E, use artists that were famous from 2E. <br/><br/>It would be hard, but I would invite all these artists to this coming Gen Con, and have them work on a giant mural together during the show that blends all their styles. Include the final piece in the book as a symbol of what's to come!<br/><br/>I would reach out to...<br/><br/>Clyde Caldwell<br/><img alt="image" src="http://dungeonsmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/clyde-caldwell-ravenloft-300x196.jpg"/><br/><br/>Larry Elmore<br/><img alt="image" src="http://dungeonsmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/larry-elmore-basic-set-300x224.jpg"/><br/><br/>Fred Fields<br/><img alt="image" src="http://dungeonsmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/fred-fields-red-wizard1-239x300.jpg"/><br/><br/>Jeff Easley<br/><img alt="image" src="http://dungeonsmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/jeff-easley-dmg-220x300.jpg"/><br/><br/>Brom <br/><img alt="image" src="http://dungeonsmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/brom-02-248x300.jpg"/><br/><br/>Tony DiTerlizzi <br/><img alt="image" src="http://dungeonsmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/diterlizzi-cat-lord-243x300.jpg"/><br/><br/>Wayne Reynolds<br/><img alt="image" src="http://dungeonsmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/reynolds-eberron-02.jpg"/><br/><br/>And then I would reach out to fantastic artists from other RPG communities, like...<br/><br/>Jennifer Rodgers<br/><img alt="image" src="http://images.epilogue.net/users/devilbunny/bdgtpcover.jpg"/><br/><br/>Zak S<br/><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SzkWcfVLs3w/Tw5XeZJyyBI/AAAAAAAADSo/m3ZJcZz14Yc/s400/118.jpg"/><br/><br/>Will this be expensive? Yes! Will the advantages outweigh the costs? Yes! Especially if these artists enjoy their work and are excited about D&amp;D. I would even name magical items, spells, or feats after them. You also don't need to exclusively use these artists. Include 1-3 pieces from each, include artists with similar styles, and then include artists with completely new styles because this isn't just about the past but also the future!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354696/#Comment_354696" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T10:54:18+00:00" title="January 17, 2012 10:54AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2012 10:54AM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fervently believe that the art is what makes a game and attracts people to gaming. <br/><br/>Say, you're in a bookstore and know nothing about RPGs but you're a little hip and little nerdy, so you know what's what.

I wonder if that's more than a correlation...<br/><br/>I don't know if I'd say the older art sensibilities had a "sense of place" -- I'd say "sense of narrative" instead.  All those old illustrations that Storn talks about gave a sense that the viewer was seeing a freeze-frame of a larger narrative.  The newer art feels more "posed."  It doesn't invite the reader to consider what has happened, or what's about to happen.

If I'm doing a superhero book and I want a semi-realistic style (ie, less spandex) and you give me Bruce Timm cartoony art, you ain't getting the job.  But if you can take Bruce Timm and put folds in some clothes and give a bit more roundness to the face and come to a more semi-realistic melding with your style.  Maybe you get the job.<br/><br/>But just let artist do whatever they want?  Those are called Fine Artists and they can bring their stuff to the gallery.  Illustrators, for better or worse, are blue color artists.  We serve the needs of the client.  We hit deadlines and we try to please art directors and we try to support the text.  We try to sell the product.  And being flexible in approach of subject matter is a good thing.  So, if a male artist puts a bit more frill and flowy dress, cool.  If Jennifer Meyer wants to push her inner Frazetta... cool too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354750/#Comment_354750" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T16:04:55+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  4:04PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I hear that a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I see a lot of bad art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354817/#Comment_354817" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T07:01:03+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  7:01AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing missing in lot of latter-day D&amp;D art is a sense of whimsy.

All those old illustrations that Storn talks about gave a sense that the viewer was seeing a freeze-frame of a larger narrative.  The newer art feels more "posed."  It doesn't invite the reader to consider what has happened, or what's about to happen.  There's no fruitful void.</blockquote>\nJust a little counterpoint to this, which I am hearing all over the GamerWeb and really wonder about. The difference here is<br/><br/>"Narrative" art - tells a story; says "this is the kind of story you can experience with this game". What if I want a different story than that? I sometimes think some of the call for this style of art is about people wanting to lay claim to a particular "core story" for D&amp;D and cut off the stuff they see as "not D&amp;D". I don't mind some of this, but honestly a lot of it just turns me right off.<br/><br/>"Character shot" art - yes, some of it sucks, but it doesn't suck because it's character illos. A character shot says: "this is the kind of character you can be in this game." As far as I am concerned, lots and lots of this, with massive diversity of style, implied setting, race/sex/appearance in general, implied play style... this is great, ESPECIALLY when it is stripped of somebody else's idea of what sort of things that character should get up to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354925/#Comment_354925" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T23:07:06+00:00" title="January 18, 2012 11:07PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would love to see a splash page on the front of the character creation section that had a grid of like 20 no-background PCs: one giant sword anime one, one grim snaggle-toothed Old School guy with a backpack, one Junko Mizuno one, one underdressed Frazetta one, one Kev Walker comic booky one, one Warhammerish Simon Bisley one, etc. etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354953/#Comment_354953" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T09:42:00+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  9:42AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2012 9:42AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with that is a sizable portion of the audience doesn't just want their style promoted, they want other styles destroyed, marginalized and excluded.

Even when taken with the recommendation that a system is wicked cool; reading block text becomes labourious without some visual references, or at least inspiration. They are textbooks, for sure. In this line of thinking, design is just as important as the actual illustrations. How often have we been flabbergasted by poor integration of writing, referencing, chapter design and art in our textbooks?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to 5th ed art.... I have such a fondness for 'art done at the table', like Storn does ALL the time (and posts them!), not as the sole art for the game, but as neat little margin doodles, or character sheet impressions. The whole 'glossy magazine print run page' can be a bit much sometimes. I like coffee stains, character portraits on graph paper and pencil stetches that 'blend' into a fully realised illustrative piece. Its as if the artists are gamers, that their inspiration comes from living and breathing and playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted By: Zak SI would love to see a splash page on the front of the character creation section that had a grid of like 20 no-background PCs: one giant sword anime one, one grim snaggle-toothed Old School guy with a backpack, one Junko Mizuno one, one underdressed Frazetta one, one Kev Walker comic booky one, one Warhammerish Simon Bisley one, etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nZak, I LOVE this graphic image. Characters make our games, and I am so inspired by collected portraits like this. I especially like searching the Paizo galleries by 'class' and seeing all the fighter drawings, or clerics, or wizards, or dragons for that matter!

I'll give an example - in the last two editions if you look at the art, I think you'll see a lot of characters that look like super heroes. They all look like they've been to the gym recently, they don't have backpacks for traveling through the dungeon - the guys are well shaven. In our recent art we've added a more diverse, modular approach - you've got people that look vastly different. You'll have the halfling who's a bit overweight with some food stains on his clothes along side the more heroic look dashing sort.</blockquote>\nYeah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
