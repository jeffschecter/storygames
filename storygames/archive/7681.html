To British people, that'll be a <i>Blake's Seven</i> game; to others, it's a <i>Firefly</i> game.<br/><br/>I'm finding it difficult to make failure satisfying. For example, if any of the following things fail:<br/><br/>1. You fail to hack the electronic lock to the military base.<br/>2. You fail to hack the computer.<br/>3. You fail to sneak past the guard.<br/>4. You fail to persuade the merchant to sell you the crystals at a knock-down price.<br/>5. You fail to make the ship take off.<br/><br/>...what would be a satisfying failure?<br/><br/>I'd appreciate some help: either tell me what would be a satisfying way to fail each of those five tasks; or give me a solution to the general problem.<br/><br/>One quick point: I'm trying to avoid the PCs being captured. One problem I have is: if the consequence for failure is "There are guards coming", it often leads to the PCs' capture, which kills the story.<br/><br/>Thanks for any help!<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170613/#Comment_170613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T05:10:44+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  5:10AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd question the assumption that capture = story death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170622/#Comment_170622" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T06:30:24+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  6:30AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. <b>You fail to hack the electronic lock to the military base.</b><br/>The automated defense system pops up and starts shooting at you.<br/>You can't get in.<br/>You meet a group of UFO enthusiasts who show you the secret way under the fence, trouble is, they now like you<br/><br/>2. <b>You fail to hack the computer.</b><br/>Your ID is tagged so that you can be traced whenever you pass a checkpoint or spend any money<br/>Your computer is infected with a virus that starts to systematically corrupt all the data/programmes/kit that it can access<br/><br/>3. <b>You fail to sneak past the guard.</b><br/>The guard demands a bribe<br/>You get taken to see the boss who demands that you do a job for him<br/><br/>4. <b>You fail to persuade the merchant to sell you the crystals at a knock-down price.</b><br/>He offers you something else at a knock-down price instead, only it's stolen/infected/alive<br/>All merchants see you as an easy touch and prices are adjusted accordingly<br/><br/>5. <b>You fail to make the ship take off.</b><br/>The reverse thruster intake valve has broken, you need a new one<br/>You've run out of plotinium, get some more                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170627/#Comment_170627" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T06:56:31+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  6:56AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When there's a failure that happens, I've also seen:<br/><br/>- you muddle through, but Someone Is Watching / Tipped Off / Sneaks On Board (but, this does lead to Guard Are Coming)<br/>- someone gets hurt / KO'd / pushed into a sideplot<br/>- some key piece of gear is borked and needs a sideplot to get working again<br/>- you have to do it the Hard Way (but the Hard Way has to have its own consequences)<br/><br/><b>1.

Not more than once per episode, though. So if you want to avoid capture as a consequences, don't roll for such things unless you can think of a satisfying alternate route, or say that they succeeded but very poorly (in an interesting way).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170628/#Comment_170628" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T06:57:40+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  6:57AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, there's always the case where a mundane failure activates someone's crippling backstory.

There are only so many times "guards can get closer" before it doesn't seem like a threat. I think you need a solid mechanical consequence (like IAWA's wounds / exhaustion) and then go from there. I.e. a failure does damage, but if the damage desn't take you out its not that bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170632/#Comment_170632" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T07:16:40+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  7:16AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2008 7:23AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm leaving aside the capture issue for a moment, which is an interesting problem in its own right.<br/><br/><br/>Hi Graham,<br/><br/>I'm going to give your question on the skill checks some thought because you've nailed exactly one of the reasons that GDW's Classic <i>Traveller</i> rules failed me -- even as a youth!  And the problem still niggles at my brain.  I wanted those cool, Hard SF skill checks to matter and to make sense... but what do you do when the PCs fail?  After a while, it always just got dull.  However, I don't think I ever saw the problem so starkly phrased and understood it so well as I do now having read your post.<br/><br/>You have nailed one of the reasons I abandoned Task Resolution once I realized I could and have never looked back.  (Max: Mea Culpa)<br/><br/>That all said, it always seemed that in a cool SF game (like <i>Traveller</i>, or yours) you <i>should</i> be able to make such science and tech skill checks cool.  But I never figured it out.  I'll be starting up a <i>Traveller</i> game Sunday, jettisoning all pre-2001 rules concepts and using the mechanics of <i>Sorcerer</i> (sans demons) in part because I could never figure out a way around this problem. <br/><br/>The reason I want my brain working on it is because <i>I think it still should be possible to make such things cool</i>.  As it stands, I find conflicts between interests to always lead to more interesting results, either in failure or success.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Off the to of my head I think you'll be heading to a "story-structure-interesting" solution-- like <i>PsiRun</i>, for example (there are others) -- where a roll to do something provokes flashbacks, flashforwards and other bits of narration that let us, as audience members and creators, get a better handle on who the characters are and deepen the conflicts and characters. That wouldn't work for <i>Traveller</i>, but since you're posting this at story-games, it might line up with your agenda more properly.<br/><br/>So, my first question is, are you trying to find a solution that is old school, hard SF skill check Task Resolution, or are you open to narrative-structure chicanery (like on the TV show <i>Lost</i>, for example), where the stress of avoiding capture triggers background moments of character?<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170652/#Comment_170652" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T08:53:24+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  8:53AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a simple option.

You fail to hack the electronic lock to the military base.</b><br/><br/>Your team leader and love interest loses faith in your abilities.<br/><br/><b>2.

Oh, it wants a new graphics card too.<br/><br/><b>3. You fail to sneak past the guard.</b><br/><br/>The guard recognizes you an old army buddy. He won't let you in, but he won't turn you in either. He may become a recurring character as well.<br/><br/><b>4. You fail to persuade the merchant to sell you the crystals at a knock-down price.</b><br/><br/>It turns out that merchant is one of the few honest ones on this planet and his crystals are genuine and reliable. You might not have gotten a bargain, but you won't have to worry about premature crystal burnout either (automatic success when rolling on the Crystal Failure Table).<br/><br/><b>5. You fail to make the ship take off.</b><br/><br/>You have to fix a race to win a bet to buy new parts and you end up with a freed slave-boy apprentice as an unexpected bonus!<br/><br/>Okay, that was mostly under duress, but I'm trying to give good answers to be helpful. I agree with other posters that these circumstances are largely inherent problems with all tasked-based systems. You shouldn't make anyone roll for anything unless the outcome will add to and not detract from the story and the fun. In particular, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> is very lame. I've played games (Star Wars) where you're supposed to roll for a successful takeoff or starting up the ship and it's almost always a bad idea. Even if you turn it into something good, there's no justifiable reason for starting out with something so lame.<br/><br/>Another kinda-meta idea is to track failures and have them add up to something big and bad later. In each of the circumstances above, the players can skate by because enforcing the failure result would stiffle the story (or anytime the GM can't think of an interesting consequence for a particular check). But after five failures of this kind, something bad happens story-wise and the party has to deal with it. Maybe up until that point the players were calling the shots and taking turns framing scenes, but after five collective failures the GM gets a scene and gets to advance the villain's plans significantly - and the villain knows what the PCs have done up to that point! That would make each skill check count and when you get to four failed checks it could make a normally boring check very tense as everyone watches to see if this will be the roll the triggers the next bad guy scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170781/#Comment_170781" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T16:17:04+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  4:17PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2008 10:07PM by Peter_Aronson.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's more.<br/><br/><b>1.

You can try again, if you like.<br/>2. <b>Locked out</b>: You fail. You can't try again.<br/>3. <b>You need this</b>: You can't succeed until you do or get something.<br/>4. <b>Deal with this</b>: You fail and this thing happens. Deal with it.<br/>5. <b>Deal with this later</b>: You fail and this thing will happen later. <br/>6. <b>Suffer this</b>: You fail and get a disadvantage.<br/><br/>Here, 4, 5 and 6 come in a "you succeed" flavour, too. ("You succeed, but this thing happens. Deal with it.")<br/><br/>With 3, 4 and 5, there's an implication that you need to make a mechanical roll: to deal with the thing or to get the thing you need.<br/><br/>With 6, there's an implication that you're mechanically hampered in some way.<br/><br/>That's useful, because I can give the GM specific limits to narration ("You can say the Criminals need something.
