Turns out none of them are terribly keen on the post-apocalypse, but when I made an offhanded mention of Dungeon World to make a point about the system they latched on instantly and wouldn't let go. They are <i>very</i> enthusiastic about the idea of D&amp;D With Good Mechanics. Now, I love Dungeon World: I love what it does with AD&amp;D, I love the design space it's working in. But now that I'm being asked to run it I'm wondering if I actually want to, because I feel like I'm going to have a hard time keeping it grounded and taking it seriously.<br/><br/>And I need to keep games I run grounded and serious. I've discovered repeatedly that I'm not at my best unless there's a juicy "human interest" story going on, even when the game gets fantastic. One of the reasons I love Burning Wheel so much is that, as fantastic as its stories get, Beliefs are unavoidable mechanic that grounds play solidly in human needs and motivations. We can relate to the underlying emotional context of Beliefs even if the actions they provoke are totally foreign to us. Dungeon World doesn't have any kind of "grounding" element like that, and it makes me a bit wary of it. D&amp;D has a very specific vibe to it which Dungeon World seems to resonate strongly with, and that vibe does not lend itself to being taken all that seriously or dealing with anything deeper than a rollicking good adventure. You can do it, but the system's not helping you.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I look at the incredible <i>Dark Heart of the Dreamer</i> and see that it's taking itself deadly serious, and I start wondering whether there's really an issue here. Is it really as "simple" (hah) as tweaking the Agendas and Principles and writing some new hard moves?<br/><br/>So, the questions. Is Dungeon World any more difficult to play "straight" than any other system? For those of you who've played a Dungeon World game that took itself seriously or had some degree of human drama, was there anything in particular that you did or were mindful of?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400936/#Comment_400936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-15T18:51:54+00:00" title="December 15, 2012  6:51PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious about this too.

To me D&amp;D is very serious, because it's about caring about characters who are going off into an uncaring world to live by their wits or die horribly. There's even no palliative of the sort you usually get in horror games where you're supposed to expect and enjoy your character's death. I've encountered few roleplaying games as serious as the one that gambles with the fact that your game session might end in utterly nihilistic devastation and ruin just because your luck was a bit off. (I admit that people usually externalize this creative risk by pretending that it was the GM's fault that the party died, and in normal play it should never happen - but then that's not how I play, so that doesn't apply to me.)<br/><br/>Not familiar with Dungeon World, on the other hand, so no idea if this particular facet of D&amp;D is in there. Probably not, it doesn't seem like the kind of game that would embrace a nihilistic void.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kestral" title="Kestral"><img alt="Kestral" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kestral">Kestral</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400940/#Comment_400940" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-15T19:40:22+00:00" title="December 15, 2012  7:40PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, embracing a nihilistic void is definitely not in Dungeon World's wheelhouse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400941/#Comment_400941" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-15T19:54:00+00:00" title="December 15, 2012  7:54PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D 'silliness' is so many things to so many people.

The 'setting' as re-inforced by the playbooks and moves is agnostic in terms of mood. You can make of it what you will. In fact, the GM's agenda to 'make dungeon world seem real', can infuse all of your provactive questioning, fronts, dungeon moves and custom moves to guide the fiction into whatever 'tone' you feel like putting on the table for the players to latch onto.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400943/#Comment_400943" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-15T20:47:44+00:00" title="December 15, 2012  8:47PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            World of Dungeons is a good choice for the nihilist void that Eero talks about. I know you can do it in DW too (I've heard stories about the Cavern of the Flaming Skull), but it takes some intentionality because the core game itself puts off a more AD&amp;D2/3E vibe than something OSR, in my opinion. But if you say to the players, "Hey, this game is about a bunch of desperate people going down into a grimy, deadly hole in the greedy hope of finding treasure," and everyone is like "Yep, that's what we're doing," then you're probably good. It might help to re-write some of the Bonds, though, or get the players to come up with their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo" title="theloneamigo"><img alt="theloneamigo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/546/n3LSBO7Z43MJI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo">theloneamigo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400944/#Comment_400944" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-15T22:22:34+00:00" title="December 15, 2012 10:22PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say that the setting as reinforced by the moves and general is relatively mood-agnostic, but I wouldn't play it "for serious" without a few tweaks.

I think the Walking Eye's DW episode was the first AP I had heard.  I emediately emailed Sage/Adam to ask about the tone of DW.  "Is it really this gonzo?"  You see, to my reading of the rules and play experience, DW had been somewhere between Burning Wheel done lite and Apocalypse World in its sense of gritty drama and anguish.  DW is really robust, DW won't stop you from going more serious.  <br/><br/>The little thing you could do would be to have players write only one bond each before the first session and save the rest of their slots for filling in during the first session, by which time you will have established the more serious tone.  <br/><br/>The bigger drift you could make would be a perversion of the X card.  Take a marker and write a single word on it, the tone you are going for - serious, darker, romp, Robert E. Howard, whatever.  Have a short discussion before the first session, about what you want the tone of the game to be.  If at any point, during play, someone thinks something in the fiction doesn't fit the theme, they can pick up the card as a non-verbal cue to rewind 30 seconds and say it again but this time more to tone.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400954/#Comment_400954" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T07:47:13+00:00" title="December 16, 2012  7:47AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a simple trick I learned from running Apocalypse World: make the PC-NPC-PC triangle and/or pay attention to which NPCs people are really digging, and then, after they've grown a bit attached, do <i>horrible</i> things to that NPC.

The default tone is, probably Ghostbusters level of seriousness, but that doesn't mean it can't be grounded and intense if the group is on board with it.  The gonzo-ness comes from its popularity as a one-shot (inherently sillier) and because a lot of people get a very intentional "first time doing the FRP thing" vibe from it, putting them in a 13-year-old-kid mindset.  That's all intentional, but...  <br/><br/>You can apply the principles and agendas with that in mind or hack them a little, if it'll help.  Change out "portray a fantastic world" with "portray a grounded fantasy world".  Change out "give every monster life" for "ground the world in realistic motivations" or add that as an adjunct.  A lot will flow from the GM asking the right questions.  Look at their alignments and target them, say "Why did you do that?  How do you feel?  Are you afraid of losing your friends because of this?  Who have you hurt?  Was it worth it?"  Alignment is always something that gets oversimplified in short-term games or with groups that see it as a straightjacket - you can pry it open and feast on the delicious story-ness inside with some thoughtful questioning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401039/#Comment_401039" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T00:49:11+00:00" title="December 17, 2012 12:49AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>(Just a heads up:  the Druid's shapechanging ability seems to invite a certain silliness, so watch out for that.)</blockquote>\nI'll often ask "what do you lose when you change your shape" or "are you less than human, now" etc when the Shapeshift is brought into play.

He came to realize that killing a guy wasn't REALLY a sacrfice because he wasn't personally losing anything. So, shortly after gaining the orison for guidance move he cut off his own hand and met his god face to face. The meeting led to disillusionment, soul searching, and alignment changing. Ultimately, Itaro usurped the "wraith king" (the leader of the Obizmidian religion at the time) to become the new wraith king, and he changed the religion to a source of good in the world. The whole game was pretty serious -- both motivated and mechanically supported by stuff that was written right on the character sheet.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401061/#Comment_401061" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T08:37:58+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  8:37AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man that sounds rad.
