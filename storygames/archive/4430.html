High Charisma can be seen as a flag, but its a little on the vague side. I like "I am the most charming guy in the room" or "I was born to lead!" with big arrows and blinking lights saying <i>Here be Flags!!!!</i><br/><br/>From your post, it seems like you're playing a game that does not make much overt use of flags. "Seems like high Charisma is a flag..." is very different from "List three beliefs that drive your character" or "What are your Keys?" My recommendation is put all the character sheets on the table and get everyone talking about them. Do the flags we see work together? Are there inherent conflicts and cooperations that they point to? Can we make them cooler? Or more direct? Can we aim them at each other, or at shared goals? Do they suggest NPCs that we can invent during Chargen? <br/><br/>If your players are up for it, I'd even suggest they write "FLAGS" on their character sheet and start listing the things that drive their character. That way the GM and the other players will know exactly what the player wants. Sometimes the player even realizes that wasn't what they wanted the PC to be doing, and they can change things before the game begins. <br/><br/>We created character and world for a <i>Blossoms are Falling</i> game last night and my Beliefs were "I will reduce the Minamoto so that my clan can rise again," "My cousin's aborted marriage provides the opportunity to forge closer ties to the emperor," and "I will win back the Court's favor." So my character is all about marrying his cousin off to influential circles in court and getting our family (and himself!) back to its former status. My cousin of course is all about marrying his true love, who is a member of a Minamoto branch. Right there, we got game. And <i>everybody's</i> got that kind of stuff going on, where honor, duty, love, hate and ambition are all driving play and screaming "Here! This is what I want to see!"<br/><br/>Edit: You know. I probably could have said the same thing more efficiently by just writing "Yes!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100089/#Comment_100089" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T03:16:50+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  3:16AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks for your help <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>(and the high Charisme thing was just an example I lifted from a podcast I listened to)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100093/#Comment_100093" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T03:59:13+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  3:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JC,<br/><br/>I'm of the opinion that you wave your flags big and bold.  Talk about them before you start and at any point which it seems appropriate (after sessions when they weren't hit for example).  If you're playing a game with a GM, make your flags explicit to that GM.<br/><br/>Sure, a GM can look at a character sheet and maybe figure out what your flags are and therefore what type of stuff you want in the game.  But can you think of a single reason why just explicitly talking about them and removing that guesswork isn't better?<br/><br/>I can tell you one way in which it's sometimes deadly to leave it to GM guesswork: Sometime people buy high stats because they hate that part of the system and the implications of failure at same.  Like a player who creates a character with a really high "Detect Invisible Ninja" skill or something because there were invisible ninjas in a game he played once who snuck up on him and that pissed him off.  He's actually saying "For the love of god, no invisible ninjas!" rather than "Please fill the setting with invisible ninjas, for I wish to detect them!"<br/><br/>Speaking your flags to the GM and the other players before you create your characters is even better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100095/#Comment_100095" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T04:20:01+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  4:20AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2007 4:21AM by Rich Stokes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a semi related random thought really:<br/><br/>"Sekrit Rools" and the taboo some gamers have with not talking about stuff like this seems to stem from having had spent extended periods in their past in the very common (and perfectly valid and cool) mindset that they were trying to experience a game setting from the POV of their character.

But it can also be helped if you re-name "Charisma" as "Handsomest lad in all the land" or "A stare that can stop a charging gorgon" as appropriate.<br/><br/>You might also find <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4090" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> informative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100136/#Comment_100136" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T07:40:44+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  7:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Also, a considerable number of players do not know at character generation what they want to be doing with the character.

Thus, it isn't a matter that once characters are built the Players have to shut up and live only within their characters.  The ability to <i>speak at the table to one another as the people at the table </i> seems a strange idea for some groups, but it's vital if new information and focus of play is to be communicated.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100161/#Comment_100161" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T08:40:33+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  8:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's situational.

In that discussion can tend to drain a little bit out of the themes, take a little energy from them. Better if they're discovered in play, IMO. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, again, that's if it's going to work. If you're really unsure, then a little prodding is fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nJD, I'm with you if there's an understanding that if the player simply can't discover any flags, that they can retire the character and start a new one. Yeah, it's somewhat of a waste of time if/when this happens, but I do agree that it's fun to discover what you like about a character after you've started play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think that it's worth worrying about to the extent that you have to get all proactive.

This isn't directly related to flags, but it could be used in flag-ful games too.<br/><br/>Huh.<br/><br/>I just had an insight.<br/><br/>In system-heavy games with no explicit flags, more knowledgeable players will often make characters for people who understand the rules less well.  This has the upside of making their characters more effective, but also means they may wind up with characters they are less invested in.  I mean, I always knew this, but looking at it in terms of flags makes it more clear why this is.  It means there needs to be really good communication between the person building the character and the person who is going to be playing that character.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100399/#Comment_100399" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T06:16:36+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  6:16AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite><br/>In system-heavy games with no explicit flags, more knowledgeable players will often make characters for people who understand the rules less well.</blockquote>\nThis has just sparked off a really interesting chain of thought.<br/><br/>Back in the day (and by "The Day" I mean the years 1988 - 1993) I used to run a whole lot of GURPS and later Shadowrun.  Anyone who's played or read either or just created a character will know that it can be a total arse ache.<br/><br/>With Shadowrun, (and we're talking first and second ed here) there was this whole priority thing, then optimising your attributes so that you made the most efficient use of the points to get your derived attributes like Reaction etc as high as you could, then there were racial modifiers on top of that, anything up to one million NuYen to spend on cyberwear, which also gave you bonuses to attributes which sometimes changes your derived attributes etc etc.  It was pretty complex, even before you started shopping for bullets and katanas.<br/><br/>GURPS was simultaneously less arduous and worse, because there was the core book, plus a book for modern era stuff, Sci-Fi stuff, Supers stuff, Magic stuff, Psionic stuff, Martial Arts stuff etc etc.  GM, I was the one who decided which bits from which books were going to be used and how they all tied together.  Plus, y'know, spending 200 points on a character with little or no guidance is pretty bloody hard.<br/><br/>The players didn't own the same 10+ books for each system which I happened to have, so expecting them to create functional characters on their own seemed pretty unreasonable.  So what I used to do was have a short session where I'd explain the concept behind the campaign and the approximate power level and get everyone to tell me what type of character they wanted.  We'd have everyone there, these were the days before email and mobile phones and I didn't get to see these guys outside of the regular club slots so it had to be done as a group or not at all.  I'd write up notes of what the players said they wanted from their character, what they wanted to be able to do (within the power level of the campaign) and any specific tricks they wanted to be able to pull off.<br/><br/>I'd create the characters between sessions and present them to the players the next week.  They'd look them over (they understood the meaning of everything, they'd played the games just not studied the books like I had) and point out anything they wanted doing differently.  This didn't take long.  I'd do any re-tooling between session and we'd then have characters ready for next time there was a long slot at the club.  I'd keep the notes I made from the character creation data capture and it would end up being the recipe for each session: Lister wants to kill stuff, add something for him to kill, Stuckey likes to investigate, make a puzzle or some shit, Bill wants to play the lecherous character, make sure there's some hot chick for him to hit on etc etc.<br/><br/>I never thought of it like this until today, but that was some clever shit I was accidentally doing right there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I'm fairly sure that example is lifted from my show. I obviously didn't do well in explaining that good flags are designed to be easily seen, so hopefully they don't need to get spelled out a lot. So in D+D you might want to check in with the fighter with a high charisma, In Burning Wheel, or many other Indie games it should be more obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven't encountered any games with clear flags you might look at keys in The Shadow of Yesterday. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/tsoy/book1--rulebook.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the text only creative commons version of the rules. It's very close in some ways to D+D, and in some ways it's a world apart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100422/#Comment_100422" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T08:59:54+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  8:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hey Clyde <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>(feels kinda weird talking by forum to someone I actually heard talking on a podcast...)<br><br>I'm really getting into this RPG-theory thing, and I like your show a lot!<br/><br/>and yeah, that's where I got the "high Charisma" example from <br/><br/>I think my problem stemmed from the fact that I was under the impression that flags were, for lack of a better word, indirect (actually, "implicit" might be a better word)<br/><br/>either because 1/ the mechanics don't allow explicit flags (which doesn't really make sense, now that I think about it)<br/><br/>or because 2/ the player doesn't consciously know what he wants from the character<br/><br/>or because 3/ there's an understanding that the GM is supposed to pick up the flags strictly from the character-sheet<br/><br/>thanks to everyone who clarified these topics in the posts above                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
