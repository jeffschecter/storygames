There seems to be a bit of a clash in playstyles, and it has created some concern within several members of the group, that the way I run the game favors one playstyle over another.<br/><br/>To be more clear, I try not to define the possibilities of a situation too strictly, and tend to evolve the situation based on the involvement of the characters. Of course, this will tend to favor the more vocal, and immediately acting characters, as they are the ones pushing the buttons, and giving me ideas about how the world is acting at the time. <br/><br/>One of the quieter players feels I should do more to focus the spotlight on the less vocal members, and create time for them to consider situations, and force the vocal players to stop acting so immediately. I responded negatively to this suggestion, because I didn't want to force anyone to play differently. I suggested that it sounds like an in game dramatic issue, that the group needs to resolve in character. I also suggested  that if she feels I'm missing cool opportunities to give her character interesting options, she can say things like "Do any plants look like they have interesting poisonous properties" or "are there any ledges I can climb on to stay out of sight?"<br/><br/>Of course, some of the issue could be remedied if she felt comfortable taking narrative control from time to time, like I could give her the option to describe exactly what the group finds in the next room, but she specifically does not want to do something like that, which i think is fine. Some people will naturally prefer to focus on their characters, and not be put on the spot to create the environments.<br/><br/>Are there any strategies that I could employ to really help the more quiet players have fun, and give them the opportunity to shape the story that the very vocal players have, without having to limit anyone else too greatly?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406167/#Comment_406167" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T15:53:07+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  3:53PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Always think in terms of incentives.

Give them responsibility for certain things in the game, focus on issues that are important to the character.<br/><br/>I once had a very quiet player who didn't talk much or do much. He was playing a sort of "Prince" character, so I set him up as an authority, and had people come to him with petitions. Now everyone was waiting on his decision for anything to happen next, which he enjoyed quite a bit.<br/><br/>Find out what the player (and her character) is interested in in the story, then make it more of a focus of play.<br/><br/>More importantly, of course, try to see whether your behaviour really is favouring some players (or a particular play style) over others. It's hard to self-diagnose sometimes, so use the player's input. Ask her what she would like you to do differently, then do it as best you're able. You might learn some cool things you'd never think of on your own!<br/><br/>What game are you playing?

Basically, I give them some control but don't overly tax their creativity. Occasionally they will interject with an alternate idea but nobody is forced to contribute. <br/><br/>As Paul says, directing things towards an interest can help but sometimes you just have to accept that they are going to take 10 seconds or so to answer or that they are content just dealing with situations as established and rolling dice. These people usually tend to be the poorer actors as well which compounds the problem as the other players don't engage with them very well.  <br/><br/>I've "cured" a couple of people by having them play Fiasco but I must say that this is a "kill or cure" option. Making stuff up is all there is in Fiasco and to an extent, it's a skill like any other but some people just inherently dislike it. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406200/#Comment_406200" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T00:42:23+00:00" title="February 14, 2013 12:42AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2013 12:43AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Are you asking everyone, "What do you do?", with equal frequency?

Good suggestion!<br/><br/><br/>nmceri: I know, I know, you said "I didn't want to force anyone to play differently," but that kind of hands-off approach might not cut it if you've already got players who feel like they're getting the short end of the stick when it comes to spotlight time. Saying "I don't want to tell the loud players to cool it" is exactly the same as telling the quiet players "I want you to be louder," isn't it? If you've got a serious clash in playstyles, <i>everyone</i> (including and especially you as the GM) probably needs to shift a little bit towards some kind of acceptable middle ground.<br/><br/>Make it a goal for the next session you run: in this session, you will focus on the quieter players and not let the louder ones cut in line in front of them. In fact, tell everyone that's what you're doing! Maybe the louder players will appreciate the problem ("Oh, yeah, I guess I do steamroll you guys constantly, I'm sorry!") and help you out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406206/#Comment_406206" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T04:02:52+00:00" title="February 14, 2013  4:02AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2013 4:05AM by 3Jane.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found that Tenra Bansho Zero's fanmail-like mechanics visually show me when I'm not giving enough attention to some players.<br/><br/>(Summary: have a pile of tokens. Anyone at the table can hand a token to any other player or GM if they do something cool, have a great line, or simply roleplay their character's goals/personality. In TBZ these tokens are then used for in-game purposes, but you could perhaps just adopt the thumbs up/diagnostic bit of it).<br/><br/>Another bit I took from TBZ is that not all players need to be in the same scene all the time.  If I see a player (or players) with a very small pile of these thumbs-up tokens, I will attempt to frame a scene with just them in it. If it doesn't fit in the current storyline and situation, perhaps it can be a flashback, a flash-forward, or a minor interaction on the way in?<br/><br/>It's not really about forcing anyone to do anything. It's about what's interesting to watch. And the interesting bit to watch are the characters - all characters. I don't run games that are all about action with forgettable characters. I'm interested in what they do, why they do it, how they react when faced with hard choices, how THEY shape the story.<br/><br/>If we use a theatre metaphor here (one of the inspirations for TBZ is Kabuki theatre), you could say that the audience (us: the players + GM) wants to see ALL the characters in action, but perhaps some of the actors are less experienced, shy, slower to react etc. Therefore as a GM/director of the play I control the spotlight on purpose - to give a chance to these actors and also to satisfy my curiosity - I haven't seen them do anything for a long time, what are they doing? They are interesting!<br/><br/>Shy players/actors also enjoy playing for others benefit, but may not be loud, self-assured or experienced enough to know how to do it. I, being more experienced and having more tools to direct the action and to gauge the amount of spotlight, need to make space for them.<br/><br/>Also I *very* much agree with this:\n<blockquote>Saying "I don't want to tell the loud players to cool it" is exactly the same as telling the quiet players "I want you to be louder," isn't it?</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nmceri" title="nmceri"><img alt="nmceri" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nmceri">nmceri</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406230/#Comment_406230" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T12:10:55+00:00" title="February 14, 2013 12:10PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great response, and a lot of good suggestions. I'm glad some perspective is being given here on the other side of the story, so I can understand it better. I'm also a first time DM, so I know I have a lot to learn.<br/><br/>A couple things I've learned<br/>-I can't make quiet players play loud, and I need to keep that in mind. <br/><br/>-I should try to frame scenes for them to shine in.<br/>I do create them, and try to heavy handedly reinforce them with my descriptions, but they haven't taken the bait yet, and then more forceful players interfere. Maybe something like a flashback is in order. Or maybe an unavoidable trap to separate them, and force them into the frame. I tend not to like unavoidable traps, but maybe it's forgivable in this case.<br/><br/>-I might be keeping the interaction too open, and I could ask specific players "what do you do?" more often than simply asking the group the same question. <br/><br/>I've been running 4e, but I'm switching to Dungeon World next session, as 4e just isn't helping us play the game we're trying to play. I'm having a hard time providing proper deadly challenges, partially because the combats are so time consuming, and we're all more interested in telling the story, and partially because I am inexperienced. With DW, combat is a natural extension of the story, not a separate thing where storytelling slows to a crawl. <br/><br/>The quiet player's biggest problem is that one player constantly doing things like charging forward without consulting the group. Whenever that happens, I ask each member individually, "what do you do?" Nobody ever tries to stop them. I still feel like much of the issue can and should be solved in character. If someone runs forward into danger constantly without consulting the group, there should be social disincentives within the group to stop them from doing that. I can help by punishing the behavior with terrible danger, or traps, but that always leads to them being in the spotlight even more, and that's the problem in the first place, their actions constantly bring them into focus, and force the group to deal with their situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406234/#Comment_406234" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T12:51:04+00:00" title="February 14, 2013 12:51PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say this is a fundamental problem of rpg <br/>The original D&amp;D box rules separated the character group into mapper and spokes person,,,,, I think there was more I'm not sure.<br/>Having a spokes person sounds weird but I think someone anticipated the kinds of problems we all get when a free for all is the only other solution.<br/>I have notice styles of play do get the upper hand. <br/><b>Roleplaying around</b> <br/>I use this to describe players engrossed in character to character play.<br/>I've also noticed players next to each other engage easier then players two or more chairs away.

Do you have any ideas how we might be able to give him more of a chance to shine? Can you help me get him more involved?"<br/><br/>I think a lot of players might go, "Oh, great point! My character's been kind of a daredevil lately and gotten stung a couple of times. Maybe from now on I'll play him up as someone who's gotten a little sheepish, and will ask for Joseph's advice before acting, since he doesn't want to get stung again. It could lead to a more interesting relationship between the two of us."<br/><br/>If you're playing Dungeon World, there are a few really good tools in there which can help you.<br/><br/>1. Look at the Bonds, and use them to connect characters to each other. This makes the conversation even easier: "Hey, Ben, I noticed Joseph's been kind of hanging back a lot lately. Your character's Bond says that he 'defers to Joseph due to his greater experience with the underworld'. How do you feel about that? Can we play that up a bit more?"<br/><br/>When you focus some aspect of play on a Bond, it naturally puts both the characters involved in the spotlight.<br/><br/>2. "What do you do?" and the way you frame your hard moves is another good way to move the spotlight around. You can and should ask "what do you do" to specific players sometimes (and particularly the person in question). Tell the group, "Hang on, I know you're all ready to charge the bad guys, but we haven't heard from [Lucy] yet. Lucy, what do you think? What does your character think we should do?"<br/><br/>You can do the same thing with the moves. For instance, let's say one character just runs ahead, jumping into danger. He fails a move or gets into a tough situation. "You're on your back, there's goblin spears whistling at your head!" And then you say "what do you do?"... but not to that player! Ask that question of the other characters who are watching this happen. "You're hanging back, you see your comrade in serious trouble... what do you do?"<br/><br/>It's a good trick in DW to make a hard move on one character but then ask a different character how they respond.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406265/#Comment_406265" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T17:22:34+00:00" title="February 14, 2013  5:22PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I've also noticed players next to each other engage easier then players two or more chairs away. <br/></blockquote>\nMy friend John makes a point of using this to his advantage:<br/><br/>He arranges the seating so that the quietest players are closest to him, and the loudest farthest away.

He liked being in the group for social reasons but things were getting really rough on the guy. I eventually decided that for the next couple of sessions absolutely everything he said, whenever he said it, was absolutely true, in the Computer's mind, no matter how ridiculous or insane it was, and anything that made him look or seem even slightly scapegoated was absolutely untrue.  The resulting turnaround was insanely bloody and hilarious.  <br/><br/>PS This conflation of the GM role and a mega-powerful in-setting presence is one of many, many reasons that Paranoia's setup is <i>pure genius.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406299/#Comment_406299" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T07:33:30+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  7:33AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2013 7:34AM by anansigirl.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a few tactics you can utilize to get quiet players to interact more. A lot of it has to do with their comfort level, I've found. I used to get a bit impatient with this type of player (I'm not here to hold your hand! type of attitude on my part). But that's pretty shortsighted of me. I've also been the quiet player sometimes, because other players always elbowed their way into the spotlight, pushing everyone else at the table to the side because they didn't make room for them. So what I do now is this stuff.<br/><br/>1. Go around the table and make sure every player gets a turn. Ask them directly what they would like to do.<br/>2. Often the quiet player will hesitate. Ask them first, then go around the table with everyone else to give them time to think. Come back to them.<br/>3. Observe your players. Are they allowing the quiet player to speak? If not, reinforce space for the quiet player. Do this repeatedly until the quiet player realizes they have space to speak, and feel comfortable speaking on their own. This could take a lot of time and patience. Recruit at least one other player at the table as an ally to help you make this space (the whole table would be better though!)<br/>4. Reinforce that turn-taking and mutual respect at the table thing!<br/>5. If a quiet player hasn't spoken in awhile, point the spotlight on them. Ask them provocative questions that require more than a yes or a no. "I really want to know what your character looks like and the attitude she has when she walks into this scene. Could you describe it to me? Actually, now can everyone else do that too?" Be inclusive.<br/><br/>Also, its possible gender roles could be rearing their head if she's the only woman player at the table. It's been proven that a woman will be quieter around a group of men (despite being the liberal feminist I am, I often find myself falling prey to this!). This is of course not a hard fast rule but it does happen. Keep it in consideration, and make a bit of space for her!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406431/#Comment_406431" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T21:32:29+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  9:32PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might also think about doing some warm-up exercises designed to help key the louder players into the energy of the group. I like acting exercises, like having people count to twenty with their eyes closed -- no two people can talk at the same time or the group has to go back to one and start again. <br/><br/>This, and other exercises can help the group remember that it's a collection of players playing together, for each other, rather than a collection of individuals. It can also help sensitize extroverts to the social energy of the rest of the group, and it forces introverts to participate.<br/><br/>Or anyway. That's part of how I deal with it in live games -- no idea if it'd work for tabletop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
