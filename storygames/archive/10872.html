I used to play just with friends, but sometimes I play with strangers at <a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.playdiplomacy.com</a> (which is a great site if you like the game).<br/><br/>My last game with friends ended with people quitting, and my girlfriend refusing to ever have anything to do with my crazy-gamer friend ("I don't care if he apologized, I don't ever want to meet that guy") . Another friend of mine has sworn off playing with the rest of us forever. And I'm currently in an internet game with people I don't know where I argue with one of the other players because he keeps telling me to "Take it easy" and "Calm down" whenever I send him what I think are perfectly bland, non-upset Diplomacy messages.<br/><br/>But I don't think any of these people are wildly dysfunctional. I think there are such hugely varying ideas of "How You're Supposed To Play" that people come to the table with very different expectations of the game.<br/><br/>Many people feel that in Diplomacy *ANYTHING GOES* ... there is no such thing as cheating, unsportsmanlike behavior, dishonesty, etc. Which sounds weird, but it's very common. And if you are in a group where everyone thinks that, it works great. But when you combine those players with different kinds of players, social mayhem ensues.<br/><br/>With the guy I'm playing with now, he sends almost no messages. Which to me is a crazy way to play the game. But to him, my multiple "Hey, what's up with your move?" messages apparently make me seem insane and histrionic.<br/><br/>I guess I have no real point here, other than to say that Diplomacy (while not a role-playing game per se) illustrates better than anything else the idea that a game is made up of more than the written rules, at least to me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241147/#Comment_241147" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T19:30:49+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  7:30PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Diplomacy has some killer emergent play.<br/>Much like Mafia/Werewolf, it's deceptively simple but rich.<br/>It strikes some pretty beautiful notes.<br/>Have you played <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/265" rel="nofollow">Intrigue</a>?<br/>It's got alot of similar things going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241167/#Comment_241167" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T00:06:15+00:00" title="November 10, 2009 12:06AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apparently I've got to play Diplomacy.

There are definitely some unwritten rules that will have an effect on play. I originally made note of these while trying to suss out the fine points of what was a somewhat opaque game to me from a social standpoint, but keeping them in mind has helped improved my game.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Don't be a dick.  With rare exception the most brash or demanding player gets ganged up on eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Don't get too big too soon. Early success often leads to being ganged up on and eliminated. Russian players seem to have this problem frequently. Probably exacerbated by the large geographical size of Russian territories.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Don't stagnate. If you fail to maken any, or enough, progress in the form of supply center acquisitions, you will likely be used as a buffer by an "allied" neighbor then destroyed when convenient. Italy seems to suffer from this most often. It's probably better to make risky moves than safe and predictable ones if you can't seem to gain any momentum.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Communicate, early and often. Even if every word out of your mouth is a lie, at least you'll be presenting a facade with which the other players can engage. Nothing is more worthy of suspicion then a player that doesn't communicate, or only does so infrequently or in a very clipped and brief form. Besides if you don't communicate you can't form alliances or keep them going. You also can't engage in various forms of diplomatic scheming and skullduggery. The silent player is a losing player.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the issue of honesty/dishonesty, most people I've played with seem to understand that scheming and dishonesty are part of the game. But they will also punish those that engage in dishonesty with them if possible. It usually takes the form of doing whatever can be done to hinder the stabbing/lying player's success regardless of the cost to themselves. So I guess the rule there is "Don't get caught in a lie by a player that will not be out of the game next turn." But I've also found that "It's better to ask for forgiveness than for permission." is something to keep firmly in mind. Part of the fun of the game can be exploring that fine line between actions that are forgiven and those that lead to war or annhiliation. If you're otherwise sticking to the four rules above, you can gain a lot of leeway in this regard.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the games I've played in have been anonymous, which certainly effects the social dynamic during the game. The non-anonymous games have had some interpersonal drama. Mostly expectation clashes leading to a (misplaced?) feeling of betrayal. From some of the vehemence I've seen during play it's not hard to imagine Diplomacy leading to damaged friendships. Some people take games extremely personally. A game like Diplomacy where play is competitive, socially focused to a large degree, and beyond what any rules text can cover is just ripe for expectation clashes and hurt feelings of all sorts. Sort of like High School.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241170/#Comment_241170" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T00:37:47+00:00" title="November 10, 2009 12:37AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh my lord do I love this game but I will never play with friends again.

The myth part is when people glorify and mystify the dangerous edginess of the game. I encounter this sometimes, usually in the form of wild stories about how "anything goes in Diplomacy", stories that fail to address the simple fact that if you can't play like a decent human being, then <i>I'm</i> going to get offended, and I'm not exactly a Diplomacy virgin of any sort. It's like people hear too many stories of how British postal players used to break into each other's homes to steal their orders, and then for some strange reason fail completely in realizing that this is criminal, crazy and in no way admirable.<br><br>The playing out of their depth part is just like people have said - good play of Diplomacy requires you to realize that personal trust is not a tool of play in this game. People who can't distinguish between what happens in the game from what happens outside it can't play without getting hurt. Almost everybody has to learn this lesson by losing viciously in practical play, and for some people this very lesson is so devastating that they don't want to touch the game anymore afterwards.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241176/#Comment_241176" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T04:44:28+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  4:44AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Eero is spot on.

It seems to me the things you do in the game to get people to trust you are pretty much the same that you use in everyday life. I mean, you don't have to, but it's what works best, and people will do it as soon as the situation gets a little tricky on the board, sometimes involuntarily (if only through their body language). That's why people's feelings are hurt so bad when they get betrayed in the game. They feel exactly like they've been betrayed in real life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241188/#Comment_241188" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T06:42:03+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  6:42AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience, on the other hand, is that when the play elevates to a somewhat proficient level (all players have a full game of experience under their belts, say), the amount of simple betrayal takes a sharp dive. After that Diplomacy becomes an intricate game of strategy in which trust is given not because you believe in the other player but because <i>trust is mandatory if you want to win</i>. When we hold Finnish Championship tournaments and such, there really isn't any hurt emotions involved, because everybody at the table knows that the only reason for another player to betray them is if that player is going to be benefiting from that betrayal himself. At that level of play the trick is to prefer trust that cannot be broken for benefit, and only risk trusting an opponent in position for stabbing you when all other choices are worse. At that point I don't really see trust as much of an issue - there is none, all players realize that they are ultimately playing against each other, everybody knows the score to the game. You can't offend others when they know what the game is about.<br><br>On the other hand, Diplomacy is a very intricate game, and the styles of play are pretty different in different parts of the world. From what I've read about it, Americans play in a much more emotional and static style than we do around here in the Nordic countries. This might be partially because of dated sources (much of Diplomacy literature dates from the '70s and '80s), but many phenomena that are reported from the USA are practically unknown in the Finnish Diplomacy scene. For example, permanent alliances (possibly pre-arranged before the game or nearly so) and intentionally tied games are not much known around here; on Finnish Championship levels the firmest alliances usually last only 2-3 years at most, ending when the underdogs try to concertedly balance the board position (and improve their own chances) by bribing of threatening the alliances into breaking. I could see how you'd view the game in a different light in that sort of environment, as Diplomacy is much more desperate and wargamey if the alliance structure at the board is naturally static. In an environment where alliances are deeper and more static, there is also more trust involved in forming them, and thus more reward for breaking them, which might account for American reports of Diplomacy as nothing more than a game of betrayal.<br><br>Then again, part of the skill of good play in Diplomacy is definitely a capability for gauging the table's social atmosphere and adjusting your own play to it. I've read about local microclimates in which Diplomacy has become unplayable because players precommit to their alliance structures too much and fear loss of credibility if they ever break these alliances to try for solo victory, but the result of that was already mentioned - the game becomes unplayable if the players as a community manage to convince each other to not strive for victory of the single board. In a play environment poisoned by metagaming I can easily see Diplomacy becoming unfeasible for all sorts of reasons. Aside from metagame issues, though, I find Diplomacy beautifully self-regulating for the most part: an outsider coming into a local play culture will almost always benefit (in the sense of winning the game here and now) by playing counter to the local assumptions rather than buying into them, which means that over time people tend to learn to be better in the game instead of reaffirming their local peculiarities.<br><br>I agree with James in that all games have social expectations involved, and should those not match, play will not succeed. I don't consider Diplomacy any worse in this regard than Chess or Go, for example.

You really need to in order to get the full experience of the game (I think, I've never played online, so what do I know?) I think you're in the DC area, and I would drive up for a game, seriously.</blockquote>\nAnd then you'd end up with Italy.<br/><br/>I have played in person before.

After that you're marked for life.  What makes Diplomacy so powerful is that you have to play it such that you can actually play it again with the same people.  If you get known as the guy who makes alliances claiming to play for the allied victory, but always break them at the end for the solo win, who's going to believe you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's why playing with the same people over and over is so crucial.  Diplomacy the game...like diplomacy itself...is a game about reputation and leverage.  If you playing with a bunch of people who have no reputation and you have no leverage with, then you're blind and essentially just bouncing little wooden blocks off each other on a map of Europe.  If you're playing with people where reputations are at stake and leverage is available...THEN, you're playing Diplomacy.  And THEN the price of ultimate betrayal to get the win is meaningful to the extent that it damages your reputation for all future games played with that group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241342/#Comment_241342" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T16:39:04+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  4:39PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br><br>Having played for years with more or less the same group, I agree that this can make for awesome games.

When you betray early and often you create a social environment of betrayal and backstabbery. When people are reliable and rational it creates that pattern - which makes the stabs so much more effective!<br/><br/>I noticed this social effect in the game "Junta." When I started the game giving away all the money to the other players there was no coup. Then I was able to be more unfair. No coup. I resigned and later was reelected. We went the whole game without a coup. In another session I kept all the money the first turn which naturally caused a coup. The game was plagued with coups. <br/><br/>The downfall for me with Diplomacy is that it requires a full roster of players who have to stay for the whole game. This is hard to muster.

But the other advantage online/PB(E)M games have is press: the opportunity to add to the game chatter with mock news reports commenting on the game and perhaps misleading the other players. It's just not practical to do that in a live game unless you're playing over a long period (like, one turn a day, with the board left set up somewhere) instead of in one session.<br/><br/>The one uncool act I've encountered in my Diplomacy experience happened when some friends and I were playing using an online automated judge program\u2014we emailed in our orders and it emailed the results once it had all the orders. A couple players were having difficulties getting the judge program to accept their orders, and one of the players sent a message through the press system that faked being an error message from the judge, in a bid to get people to inadvertently reveal their orders or change them. If you looked closely, it was apparent the message was a fake, so it wasn't a big deal, but the players who were being frustrated by the judge problems were understandably annoyed. <br/><br/>My favorite anecdote from Diplomacy play belongs to a friend of mine who had her history class play a few turns of Diplomacy over a week or two, as a school exercise. One of the teams came up to her and complained that another team had lied to them and attacked when they promised they weren't going to. My friend said "Yes. And...?" and the kids said "Ohhhhh..." as the lesson dawned on them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>I've watched a Diplomacy game play over the course of a whole con, with orders due hourly, even as most of the players played other RPGs or board games or what-not (or were hyper-busy con organizers).</blockquote>\nReading this thread, I was already thinking about this before I came to your post, David.

And anyway, it's not so far off to say that the current design of the game already supports crafting long-term relationships. For example, it's pretty easy to stab another player for one center, but that means that the player will probably be suspicious of you for the rest of the game. So it all works out even within the constraints of one game only.<br/><br/>The problem with trying to play Diplomacy as a metagame is that the game starts rewarding conformance to arbitrary local social morality. If you don't play according to whatever unwritten fair play rules the yokels expect, you're going to be ganged up upon or they'll refuse to play with you altogether. And all this can happen in a metagaming environment even when you're playing scrupulously according to the rules and spirit of the game. I don't have much patience for that sort of thing - in fact, I actively consider it cheating if somebody tries to blackmail others with threats concerning stuff outside the game, such as "if you stab me now, I'll destroy you in the next game we play". If you allow the discipline of the local play culture to get lax on this matter, you'll be playing through an empty ritual before you know it, just voting for the winner.<br/><br/>Marhault: I can still participate in the game, I guess, although it'll still be with minimal communication. It'll be something like "Hey, you wanna do Lepanto? Great, let's do that, I'll write you again in 1904." Let us know if it's necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245370/#Comment_245370" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T11:03:45+00:00" title="December  6, 2009 11:03AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Eero, we're down to six, so if you want in, go for it.

The moderators are down on metagaming to the point that similar patterns of play in games with the same other players (e.g., always making an alliance with the same guy) are subject to monitoring and sanction. This seems to fly in the face of Ralph's position, since what Ralph calls "considering the other player's reputation" they call "metagaming" but they seem to be concerned mainly about the most egregious forms of collusion.<br/><br/>It will be interesting for us to play in this context, since each of us know some subset of the others from on-line and face-to-face interactions, and so the possibility of making judgments about each other's diplomatic and military moves based on what we know of those out-of-game behaviors exists. For an obvious example, Nathan can now get away with making "mistakes" in his order-writing that discommode his putative allies by claiming inexperience rather than refusing to confess duplicity. (That's why he's so clever.)<br/><br/>C'mon, somebody, sign up!

The reputaton you build over the course of several games is as much a part of the game as the individual game you're playing. Sure there are are patterns of which players ally over the course of several games...those who prove to be both good players and trustworthy make good partners...those that don't...will be avoided as partner.  To me when you can start to incorporate your experience with the players from previous games...that's when the real game of Diplomacy begins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245447/#Comment_245447" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T23:42:15+00:00" title="December  6, 2009 11:42PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with your model, Ralph, is that in practice it leads the game towards stagnation. It is pretty obvious that everybody values their relationship with their friends and their continuing ability to play with them higher than a single victory in a game; ultimately that victory is meaningless, while their standing their community is important to them. Thus, when we get a precedent for people holding grudges from game to game, that translates into a strong pressure to give in to emotional blackmail. That breaking down of the ritual space is what makes Diplomacy unfunctional for some people; I myself wouldn't want to play if I knew that other people were keeping long-term score and my best strategy would actually be to actively lose by being all honorable and shit. What sort of game is it anyway, if your best play is to not try to win, but to leave everybody else with an impression that you're a good guy?<br><br>Because of the harmful effect that metagame has on Diplomacy, most long-time players I know have pretty firm principles regarding the appropriate and inappropriate diplomatic plays in the game. For example, I don't think that I've ever heard anybody but inexperienced teenagers or Americans suggest that you can't betray them because if you do, then you'll ruin your reputation for future games. That's simple blackmail, I'm not going to budge for something like that - in fact, I'm likely to attack a guy who proposes something like that just on principle to prevent that sort of attitude from spreading...                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245448/#Comment_245448" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T23:51:01+00:00" title="December  6, 2009 11:51PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: I'm available for real-time chats on the Google network by the name "eero.tuovinen", in case anybody wants a consult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245449/#Comment_245449" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T00:04:19+00:00" title="December  7, 2009 12:04AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero is describing the exact reason why I don't play Settlers of Catan, btw.<br><br>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245475/#Comment_245475" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T06:59:20+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  6:59AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2009 7:04AM by Valamir.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear the words Eero, but I really can't comprehend them.  You seem bent on characterizing my words as "holding grudges" and turning it into something petty.  Top ranked poker players study their opponents and learn whether the're the sort who can be bluffed with a strong raise or the sort who can be drawn into losing a big pot by a series of small ones.  Chess players study their opponent's techniques down to crazy level of minutia.  Professional athletes watch hours of tape on their opponents to determine how best to beat them.  That is all part of successful sophisticated play.  Learning how your opponent plays and using that information to your advantage is good play...not unfunctional...its what you're supposed to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Diplomacy the genius of the mechanics is that they are simple, interconnected, and result in complete gridlock if everyone plays solo.  It is therefor imperitive, if you are going to make any progress, to engage in cooperative efforts with other players.  In fact, the primary skill in the game is in orchestrating such efforts and spoiling the efforts others might assemble against you.  Given that this is the primary way to win...how is it not good play to know how your opponents behave in such an environment?  If a boxer learns that his opponent is a sucker for a right hook following a left jab, is he supposed to never throw such a punch because that would be "metagaming" the boxing match?  Nonsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly in Diplomacy, if I know you're a sucker for an early alliance designed to cripple the British position am I supposed to not leverage that tendency in your play to my own advantage...just because I learned it from playing you three times in the past and watched you do it each time?  If after playing chess with you several times I learn that you can be sucked into leaving your defenses open if I'm willing to sacrifice my queen, then I'm going to keep doing that to you until you learn to stop taking the bait.  Would you suggest that the right way to play chess is to pretend that we've never played each other before and judge each game in a vacuum?  I can't imagine any serious chess player would do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Diplomacy the actual moves on the board...the written orders and physical shifting of pieces is secondary.  The real moves in the game are political.  So how you handle the political aspects of the game are just as fair game for being analysed and used against you as how you write your orders or capture queens.  If I've observed in your play that you will never play for an allied victory and will always attempt to orchestrate an end to all alliances that leaves you in possession of many of your former allies' holdings, should I pretend I don't know that about you and let you sabotage me over and over without ever learning my lesson to not trust you?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course if you betray me I'm going to take that into account in future games...its not about petty grudges, its about not allowing you to fool me twice.  You made a promise, you broke it, now I know that you're the sort willing to break your promises and under what conditions, so now I know to demand greater reassurances and collateral before I'll believe your next promise offered in a similar situation.  Same as if you broke a promise to me in real life.  Same as what happens to your credit rating if you break your promise to pay back a loan.  Of course your historical actions are going to be held against you in the future.  That's not a grudge...that's just common sense and good play.  I really can't fathom the idea that pointing out your history of betrayals in similar situations is "emotional blackmail".  If you didn't want your history of betrayals to influence the way people would play against you in the future, you should have been more circumspect about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entire design of the game of Diplomacy is to illustrate the trade off between short term gain and long term plans and the consequences for spending your political capital (aka trust and reputation) frivolously.    Making a killer hose move to win a game today is SUPPOSED to have consequences on your ability to win in the future.  That's the point...is winning this game really so important to you that you're willing to permanently decrease your odds of ever winning again with this group of people?  If yes...then do it.  If no...then don't do it and play for the allied victory instead.  But don't do it and then whine about the consequences.  Living with those consequences is what the game is about.<br/>\n<br/>\nContrary to your experience, in my experience the players who argue against "meta game" influence in Diplomacy have been those who like to be little backstabbing betrayers and then bemoan the fact that their tricks never work again.  Of course they're not going to work again...I'm on to them now and since I now know I can't trust them to honor a demilitarized border agreement I'm instead going to ally with their enemy to crush them like a bug and take them out early because I'm surely not going to have someone I can't trust as a neighbor.  Never mind that they didn't betray me in this game, yet.  Only a fool would wait to judge them untrustworthy until the moment you lose the game because they stab you in the back...again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd once you've played the game with the same people enough times that everyone has betrayed you at some point, and you've betrayed them at some point....THAT'S when the game gets REALLY good.  That's when you are no longer playing beginners level Diplomacy and have graduated to advanced Diplomacy.  That's when the written alliances between players start to take up several paragraphs or pages covering every contingency in advance.  That's when the game stops playing like a board game and starts playing like you're LARPing an international summit meeting...the way its supposed to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245479/#Comment_245479" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T07:18:19+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  7:18AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>And once you've played the game with the same people enough times that everyone has betrayed you at some point, and you've betrayed them at some point....THAT'S when the game gets REALLY good.

In Diplomacy, even if you are reduced to banditry, you have a strong incentive to keep playing (you might be part of a drawn game, for instance) and to take play relatively seriously. Also in Diplomacy, poor play eliminates you from the game. Thus, in Dip, either you care about the outcome of play, or you're no longer at the table.<br/><br/>In Catan, poor play in the early game can shut you out of winning very rapidly, but you are never eliminated and there is no possibility for a draw. However, you are invariably placed into a king-maker position. Since this particular game is hopeless for you, king-maker decisions cannot be based on what gives you the best chance of winning -- the chance, in all cases, is zero.

Like, writing up alliance contracts, WTF? I should think that all players realize that such contracts are not worth the paper they're written on, unless the alliance is actually motivated by genuine, ongoing mutual interests. In fact, I think that we can perceive the difference in our thinking by looking that that exact thing - why do people make alliances in Diplomacy? In my view, there is only one reason, and that is that the alliance is motivated by ongoing mutual interests. You don't ally in a high-level game because you believe the other player is honorable enough to not betray you or because you have a written contract with him or because the local play culture has decided that only assholes break promises made while standing on your head or whatever - you ally because both of you can improve your position in the game at this moment by allying. And breaking those alliances - you break one when it is no longer useful for you.<br/><br/>I wouldn't otherwise have much of an opinion on this topic, but it just so happens that the game itself breaks horribly if you make things like "trust" the centerpiece of play. For instance, if players can make binding promises in the game, that opens the door to deep alliances that are formed at the game start and used to overpower the board for the benefit of the 2-3 players who make such an alliance. That is always a winning strategy in comparison to players who don't have access to such "binding" promises, so it won't take long for the entire play environment to degenerate into something where winners and losers are determined before the game has even begun. That's collusion, pure and simple - the fact that the collusion is dressed up as principles like "I won't break promises sworn on the Bible because that would ruin my reputation for forthcoming games" doesn't change what it is; you're using metagame social contract to give your in-game promises more leverage. This is why I myself don't give different degrees of promises in Diplomacy - even if another player would be confused by my passionate rhetoric or holy seven-fold oaths, that's just low-level play that won't faze an experienced player who doesn't rely on trust.<br/><br/>You'll notice that I disagree very much with the idea that the board strategy in Diplomacy doesn't matter because you can always play the people. Assuming that everybody is playing in good faith and is actually trying to win without metagame considerations, then board strategy very much plays a part. You can only negotiate about board strategy, after all, and your options for alliances and stabs are limited by what happens on the board. Therefore a successful alliance of convenience (distinct from the alliance of honor or psychology or whatnot Ralph advocates) is only possible when you succeed in creating a plan of movement that puts everybody's units in positions where betraying your allies is not to your benefit. To put it simply, an alliance can be solid by investing enough resources in positioning troops in such a manner that betraying the alliance has a negative expected value. This has nothing to do with whether you believe in the other player's promises <i>as promises</i>, and everything to do with whether those promises make tactical and strategic sense for you and him.<br/><br/>This is why I don't consider stabbing a very central part of Diplomacy play. Successful play is about knowing what moves players should make and reacting appropriately both in diplomacy and board tactics. A "stab" happens when you read a situation differently from how the opponent does; there is no trust element in this between good players, just a difference in opinion. If attacking me is the best move for a player, <i>all things considered</i>, then he should do that - in fact, I'd go as far as saying that I <i>trust</i> him to do so, because not going for the win when you can cheapens the efforts of everybody participating in the game.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Reading the above and rereading your post, I don't think that I'm communicating this as well as I could. Let's try another tack: I've played Diplomacy since 1998, roughly. We have a national association here in Finland, which means that there's a pretty wide pool of people who've gathered to play together in different combinations for the last decade. One might imagine that this would result in a play environment wherein personal reputation would be a tool of play - perhaps players would have long-term deals (or "habits", if we want to whitewash it) to support each other in games, perhaps players would decide like you suggest that written contracts are sacrosanct and so on. But no, in practice our play environment doesn't resemble anything like that at all. Players do have reputations, but they're never simple things like whether a player is trustworthy or not, at least not for the experienced and skilled players. Rather, we know that every player worth his salt is just as "trustworthy" as his own benefit in the game makes expedient; if a given player can be trusted to act in a certain way in a certain situation, then that is a weakness in his playstyle, one he should perhaps work to fix. I think that I like it this way, I don't much favour the play reports I've read of American Diplomacy play:<ul>\n<li>Long-term collusion based on personal relationships, caused by players building a trusting relationship in the metagame.</li>\n<li>Abnormally common multiway ties, caused by players being satisfied to belong in the winning coalition, which allows them to avoid having to betray their allies and gives a nice "win" without hard choices.</li>\n<li>"Playing for second place" as an extension of the above.</li>\n<li>Tactical plays that defy reason, caused by them not being <i>reasonable</i> in the first place; players who can have absolute trust in each other can make plays that go so far beyond Key Lepanto that it's not even funny.</li>\n<li>Huge importance to momentary material advantage, as the static alliance structures favour killing off small enemies however slowly it happens, without danger of alliance-splitting. If players A and B are in an alliance, the <i>only</i> way the equally-powerful player C can survive and triumph in Diplomacy is by splitting in the alliance. In honest play this is possible and in fact the best play for both A and B individually, but with metagaming available the equation changes.</li>\n</ul>\nIn my eyes, the moment you decide to forgo a win in Diplomacy because of the metagame, you're not playing the game for real anymore. The other players can't trust you to play for your own optimal self-interest which will then bring undue benefit to whoever the target of your largesse is. I don't see how this can be termed anything but collusion - that's what it is when you decide to not stab an ally because you're hoping that this way the ally will be your friend in the next game over as well.<br/><br/>I might sound horribly stern about this, but we've found that these standards of play are not that difficult to uphold in practice as long as you're at all aware of their existence. As I mentioned in passing upthread, I've only ever encountered metagaming when I've played with inexperienced teenagers, and even they seem to usually only suggest these arrangements in jest. Usually this is considered so obvious that we don't really have to make mention of the issue more than once to somebody who inadvertedly goes over the line. I might say that practically all the time I have only one trust in the play of my Finnish Diplomacy-friends: I trust that they will give me absolutely pure play unsullied by metagame strategy.<br/><br/>Also, Ralph: I realize that you don't advocate for the various dirty practices I outline here. It's just that the theoretical position you seem to hold logically leads to them, and it happens pretty slyly to boot: people are good at conforming, self-justification and not thinking things through, which means that a person who makes a big deal of his "trustworthiness" from game to game already has one foot in the dungpile I outline above. Really, it's as I say above: the moment you decide to forgo your best play because of metagame considerations, you're no more playing fairly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245509/#Comment_245509" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T09:57:14+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  9:57AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>In Catan, poor play in the early game can shut you out of winning very rapidly, but you are never eliminated and there is no possibility for a draw.

I'm pretty proud of this game theory result, being that I developed it through plenty of boardgaming and encountering this same problem you have here. I'll lay it out here for general interest.<br/><br/>The way we play kingmaking situations at my table is that any player may at their convenience declare a situation in the game a kingmaking one; they'll then demonstrate this by abstract calculation to the satisfaction of the other players, naming the kingmaker and the pretenders. The situation is defined as kingmaking if and only if the player can demonstrate that the kingmaker cannot improve his own game result (by whatever metric the game uses, usually placing), but can influence the results of the pretenders. The game is then ended as a tie between the pretenders. If the calculation does not satisfy a player, the game continues (with the kingmaker playing against the disagreeing player), but if that particular player does not win, the tie stands.<br/><br/>The philosophy of this practice originates in intuition: I once refused to continue playing when I myself ended up in a kingmaking situation, and liked the resulting implicit tie between the pretenders; it seemed fair. The problem of kingmaking might seem to be in that it's annoying to have the victory taken from you by arbitrariness of another player, but the moral price is actually on the kingmaker: I don't think that anybody should be put into the position of having to decide which one of other players wins, that's not fair on him at all.<br/><br/>The logic in this practice is that it allocates to each player the appropriate responsibility that derives from their role in the game: any player can declare a kingmaking situation because any player who doesn't consider himself likely to win should the game continue will benefit from splitting the victory - thus most players at any given time have a motivation to reveal a kingmaking situation they perceive. The kingmaker himself does not have a say in whether the game continues once a kingmake has been declared, as the whole purpose of the practice is to remove this unconscionable choice from his power. The kingmaking has to be demonstrated to everybody's satisfaction for obvious reasons; furthermore, a player can't contest the kingmaking for anybody's benefit but his own, as doing otherwise would make for another kingmaking situation. Most significantly, kingmaking is never an abstract condition that might be derived afterwards to annul a game result, but a concrete step in playing the game: if nobody notices a kingmaking situation in play or notices it but decides not to declare it, then a kingmaking situation did not in fact happen.<br/><br/>Different games are more or less prone to kingmaking situations; in some games they are so prominent that I couldn't in fact imagine playing them without a clean, satisfying rule like this. I wouldn't know what to do with the arbitrary choices thrust upon me, and I'd probably start jumping on walls when some idiot on the other side of the table throws the win to some other player at the last moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245510/#Comment_245510" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T09:58:17+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  9:58AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>(for instance, the smoke you're blowing up my ass right now in PBW)</blockquote>\nHa ha.

There are games such as Settlers that make it possible for a player to get into a position where they can't win, but the victor isn't too clear yet either. It is a genuinely difficult theoretical question as to what you should be doing in the game at that point, considering that you're still affecting the game for the players who have a chance at victory. Most of the time in most games the best play seems to be to attack the leader; this slows the game down and increases the chance of opponent mistakes or your own miscalculation actually giving you a shot at victory after all. In some games you can strive for a stalemate this way, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245521/#Comment_245521" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T10:33:39+00:00" title="December  7, 2009 10:33AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Abnormally common multiway ties, caused by players being satisfied to belong in the winning coalition, which allows them to avoid having to betray their allies and gives a nice "win" without hard choices</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI think this is the heart of our Diplomacy disagreement, Eero.  I suspect you envision single player victories to be the normal desireable win state and multiway "allied" victories to be a lesser, poorer result that is occassionally the result of legitimate stalemate but more often the result of inferior play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider the reverse to be true.  IMO the ideal end state for a game of Diplomacy is a tied or allied victory.  A single player victory generally means someone got greedy and instead of accepting an allied victory several turns ago when they had the chance tried to go it alone, failed, and set someone else up for the "win".<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that the game is designed with the 19th-early 20th century model of European balance of power politics in mind...where the entire point was to prevent at all costs a single "player" victory...it seems to me that the allied victory is far more in line with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor clarification...written treaties have never been "sacrosanct" in any game I've played.  They simply make it very clear when someone has breached the agreement, and what the agreement was for.  I don't think I've ever played a game where an early game alliance lasted the entire game unbroken, but most games have involved very long lasting power blocks maneuving against each other...which I think is appropriate to the period.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245531/#Comment_245531" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T11:02:03+00:00" title="December  7, 2009 11:02AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is certainly a degree of difference there. I agree with you in that solo victories are practically always caused by inferior play by the opposition. However, I wouldn't characterize the allied victory as ideal just because of that, due to how very difficult it is to pull off legitimately (without accepting it out of laziness, that is). For instance, the most common type of solo victory I've witnessed has not been caused by an alliance-breaking so much as an inability of the Grand Alliance to coordinate effectively enough to prevent the soloist from forcing his way into victory. The soloist, after all, has perfect control over his forces, which might easily overcome the numerically superior but confused alliance command chain. Terrain is another factor that might make it ultimately impossible for the alliance to project power as effectively as a soloist who chooses his timing and geographical positioning right. A third case happens when the Grand Alliance does not form due to some fifth columnist player betraying the ethos of the game and accepting the solo victory as long as they themselves get to be second or whatever. In all these cases we might say that the solo victory is the fault of the other players, but that's gaming right there - perfect plays do not exist. If I could predict and account for through the changing play dynamics for every potential soloist threat, and my co-players were smart enough to trust me to coordinate defense, while also being smart enough to not allow me to solo... then we might say that a solo victory would be impossible.<br><br>However, I don't really have any problem with legitimate allied victories in Diplomacy. It's just that I very rarely see those when compared with solo victories. Usually the allied victory comes about due to pure laziness or metagaming, it seems to me; the players do not care enough to make a bid for victory, or the alliance structure is too strong for them to try and make a run for it, or they fear for their working relationship with the opposition in the future.<br><br>Whether all this means that legitimate allied victories exist at all is an interesting question; it's too difficult for me to answer off-hand, though. It would seem to me that at least a legitimate three-player allied victory should exist on the Calhamer board, as there are many essentially stable three-player divides of the board that cannot be reasonably unbalanced without causing a solo victory. Some people seem to think that even a seven-player draw is to be considered a legitimate conclusion to a perfect play; I'm suspicious of that myself due to how much stronger the defensive positions of some Powers are, but figuring it out either way would require solving the whole game. Aside from that, I don't quite know how to approach investigating the theoretical issue.<br><br>In any case, it seems pretty clear that I would get my ass handed to me in Ralph's circles of play. Telling another player that I have no intention of keeping any promises for any longer than they benefit me can't be healthy in that environment.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245545/#Comment_245545" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T11:32:08+00:00" title="December  7, 2009 11:32AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">However, I don't really have any problem with legitimate allied victories in Diplomacy.

In the group I played with we wouldn't consider this "lazy" we'd consider it, "achieving maximum objective with minimal losses".  Playing for second was quite a legitimate tactic...in fact, players who had little chance to take first but refused to accept second were generally considered "crazy warmongers sending millions of people to their death for little gain".  I remember one game where we had a discussion on the likely hood of a particular player's "government" being ousted after a refusing to accept what everyone else in the game considered a fair and legimitate peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn reflection, the folks I was playing with were largely State Department, Department of Defense, Pentagon, or contracted Think Tank Types...so that was probably a contributing factor to the way we played.  There was definitely a sense of "these were our goals, our goals have been achieved, now let's figure out a way to bring the game to a close that preserves our having achieved those goals.  So end game was often an exercise in finding other players whose state had expanded enough at the expense of their neighbors for their people to be singing their praises in the streets and then getting them to "sign on" to the "peace treaty" aka...collecting enough resource centers on that "side" to end the game.  In some instances the winning faction had more players than the losing faction.  That wasn't the normal way the game ended because there was always somebody who thought they deserved one or 2 MORE resource centers, or took the "hey Britain is up 4 and I'm only up 1, sure I'll sign on, but first I need 2 more RCs".  And sometimes those "hold outs" were then set up to be dismantled by the alliance as their "warmongering ways" were a threat to peace and stability and their RCs were "collected" that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a general rule I always played for an allied victory with as few allies as possible but would accept a larger alliance if it became clear I was about to hit a downward slope based on current board position.  That's why I think alliances are almost always legitimate.  Because fighting it out to the bitter end means playing the game like a game...like an abstract exercise with no more significance than playing chess.  When we played we played like a head of state, with a powerful motive to end hostilities as soon as we could claim "victory" to the press.  Which is much more period appropriate than a more cutthroat "victory or damnation" approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut its been...almost 10 years since I lived in MD and played with those guys so, not really my circle any more.  But yes.  You would have been quickly labeled a loose cannon.  The first game it probably would have been put down to sabre rattling and posturing, but the second game...the first series of PBM or PBeM discussions (or occasionally play by phone) would have likely involved a discussion on how to divide your country up as clearly your regime was a major destabilizing influence in the region.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245550/#Comment_245550" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T11:57:05+00:00" title="December  7, 2009 11:57AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2009 12:00PM by Bill_White.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>In any case, it seems pretty clear that I would get my ass handed to me in Ralph's circles of play.

This reminds me of a game-theoretical book I paged through a few years ago; it was called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theory-Moves-Steven-J-Brams/dp/0521458676/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260215895&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow"><i>A Theory of Moves</i></a>, and it argued that one reason why prisoners' dilemma situations don't result in defection as much as theoretically predicted by game theorists is that the utility of the status quo isn't accounted for: if you're afraid of losing, you won't play. This jibes with accounts of people as being generally risk-averse rather than risk-seeking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245553/#Comment_245553" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T11:59:04+00:00" title="December  7, 2009 11:59AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph: Wow.

Nomic, if you're unfamiliar, is a game where writing the rules to the game is the game. There is one particular rule which is "Anything not forbidden by the rules is permitted." One player then lied, began insulting other players, and sabotaged the internet forum that was being used to carry out the game using this rule as his justification. It ended with everyone but the aforementioned player quitting. It made a social mess and I didn't talk to that player for quite awhile.<br/><br/>I see similarities to this and games of Diplomacy gone awry. The line between the game and social interactions is very blurry. Without a clear division, it's very easy to mistake Italy lying to Turkey as Jamey lying to Bret.

I wonder if it boils down to a difference in negotiating styles.  Consider:<br/>\n<br/>\na) I won't stab you because I'm a trustworthy person, and I said I wouldn't<br/>\nb) I won't stab you because I need my units to to take those other SCs over there<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the stab comes, it's much more painful, on a relationship level, coming from (a) than from (b).  (Even worse than (a), consider 'I won't stab you because you're my friend' - what kind of conclusion can you draw then when you get stabbed?).  It sounds like Ralph's group generally negotiates in terms of 'I won't stab you because I have signed a treaty not to, and I never break signed treaties', while Eero's group negotiates more in terms like (b).  (btw - this is pure speculation - I would very much like to hear your perspectives and corrections).<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, someone whose negotiating style doesn't match those of the other players will be in trouble.  A type A player in a type B group will either be fooled by the other players (with predictable results) or have difficulty allying with them (because they don't make arguments the group considers persuasive - I would imagine that Eero would tend to respond to 'I won't stab you because you're my friend' with 'what does friendship have to do with it?').<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, a type B player in a type A group will be facing a situation of being unable to ally at all once they stab.  In that situation, it wouldn't be unreasonable for them to refrain from stabbing at all - especially if the group agrees to a tie before there is a reasonable chance of stabbing for the win.  An interesting thing to note here is that you could conceivably have a group of type B players who all cooperate anyway, because they think they are in a type A group.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I suspect that type B negotiations are healthier, because betrayal isn't as significant.  I imagine that a lot of type A negotiations are phrased in terms of the obligations of friendship, and how some betrayal was really acceptable because the other party did some unacceptable thing first.  Again, this is just my perspective, based on having played a bit of diplomacy about 10 years ago.  I'd be very interested to hear if this makes sense to other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246121/#Comment_246121" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-10T15:20:25+00:00" title="December 10, 2009  3:20PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds to me like you've nailed it, Steven, at least regarding how we play the game around here.

I wouldn't say that it's just a difference in negotiation styles, as the difference in viewpoints seems pretty fundamental to me.

Rumania, valiant to the last, remains free of any imperial control, God save them.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-15118-3-R.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246573/#Comment_246573" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T09:59:14+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  9:59AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And it looks, with Italy and France heading East and North respectively, like North Africa may go unclaimed the whole game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246576/#Comment_246576" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T10:22:15+00:00" title="December 14, 2009 10:22AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I've ever played a game of Diplomacy where anyone expressed any interest in North Africa.

Instead say "I won't stab you because I have a signed a treaty and currently the short term gain to be had from stabbing you is not greater than the long term hit to my ability to negotiate treaties in the future...although, at some point, I expect it will be".<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I don't recall ever expressing it this way you can think of each of the regular players in our group having a "reliability index" assigned to them based on their aggregate behavior across numerous games.  Much like a bank looking at your Credit Rating, you would demand more from a treaty with a player with a low "reliability index" than you would from a player with a high "reliability index".  Players with a low index would find themselves only able to enter into lop sided treaties that helped their opponent more than it helped them (or get stuck with no treaty at all).  Players with a high index would find themselves able to negotiate turn by turn offers of support and support cutting, easily and quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was no "you're my friend, I won't stab you" nonsense.  There was very much "you have built a reputation for being stab happy, so now I'm not going to trust you'll keep your word in that offer you're trying to negotiate with me"<br/>\n<br/>\nIn which case the usual outcome was a gesture of good faith.  "I won't help you take that territory THIS turn, because I don't trust you.  But I will help you take that territory NEXT turn...IF and ONLY if you move your fleet away from my coast THIS turn."  Whereas a "high index" player could have negotiated that attack immediately with no gesture required.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers new to the group would get assigned a "reliability index" (again we never actually referred to it like that) based on who brought them into the game, what other games we'd played with them before, what we knew about them, and how much of a trust premium or discount we'd ascribed to fresh meat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ultimately, I don't expect it was much different from how Eero plays in that sense.  Its just that rather than play in a vacuum with every game being a fresh slate, we incorporated all previous game experiences...much like how international relations today are still colored by events that happened generations ago...in a previous "game".<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, as Turkey I will be more likely to ally with Italy against Austria this game, because last game as France that player proved a reliable ally with me as Britain against Germany.  I'll be less likely to listen to Austia's overtures because 3 games ago as Russia, that player totally ass raped me after promising to support my defenses.  I can't understand any logic that says I should forget that this player was able to skillfully con me before, and that I shouldn't let that color how much trust I place in his assurances now.  If you play me like a fiddle once...I'm going to remember your tricks and not fall for them again (at least not those tricks)...to do otherwise strikes me as collosally silly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246611/#Comment_246611" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T12:16:27+00:00" title="December 14, 2009 12:16PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I can't understand any logic that says I should forget that this player was able to skillfully con me before, and that I shouldn't let that color how much trust I place in his assurances now.</blockquote>\nYeah, I don't think that would be wise, or even possible. <br><br>As I said upthread, I sometimes play with a long-running Diplomacy group, and past interactions (in terms of "reliability") certainly color future ones.<br><br>But I do still disagree that this kind of Diplomacy is superior to "blank slate" Diplomacy, or that it's a design feature.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246628/#Comment_246628" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T13:51:59+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  1:51PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I found <a href="http://personal.psu.edu/wjw11/AJC%202006%20Dip.pdf" rel="nofollow">this paper</a> I wrote about a "field experiment" I conducted using Diplomacy in the classroom to see if changing how I explained the game (as fundamentally competitive or fundamentally cooperative, that is) changed how students responded to the game.

I describe it as a  situation characterized by strategic features, and wonder if highlighting those strategic aspects induces people to regard their interactions with others in that situation as fundamentally "strategic" (in the sense of being manipulative, instrumental, and ends-oriented). My answer is that it does, but only for a while: even while recognizing that they're in a strategic situation (as the manipulation check showed), they came to regard the other people they were playing with in the same way as the people prompted to regard the situation as communicative saw the other people <i>they</i> were playing with.<br><br>Which, I argued, suggests that a key feature of Habermas's understanding of communication is supported: the primacy of communication over strategy.

Word from Berlin is that Kaiser loyalists are being put before the firing squad in a feeble attempt to maintain order in the face of the advancing French armies.  The Kaiser himself leads a regiment in exile in Silisia, hoping against hope that their supply lines will remain open all the way from Copenhagen.<br/><br/>Italian expansion has now been reversed.  Imperial Austrian forces have retaken Vienna and are now working with Turkish troops to squeeze the Italians on all sides.  It is uncertain whether the Turkish occupation of a formerly Austrian held Warsaw is a sign of further cooperation between the two powers, or simply the domination that Constantinople holds over her entire sphere of influence<br/><br/>The Turkish empire itself grows dangerously strong, having recently captured former Italian holdings on the North of the dark continent and even in the South of Italy herself.  French fear-mongering from occupied German lands would build a new Entente, but at this time it is unclear whether Italian leadership are capable of, or English leadership interested in - given the complicated nature of Franco-English politics thus far in the war - maintaining any such alliance.<br/><br/>As the weather begins to break in the Spring of 1907, the fate of Europe hangs in the balance.

Nine supply centers is a BIG advantage... half way to outright victory.

We've established a Mediterranean stalemate line against the east, and Turkey has a surfeit of fleets - not enough armies in immediately useful positions to even hope proceeding against the infamously difficult Ber-Mun line. Meanwhile the English and French positions are pretty believably fortified, neither can make any meaningful progress against the other anymore. Add to this the inherent difficulty in unbalancing a three-player position, and I think that I'll be pretty surprised if this doesn't come down to a three-way draw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249223/#Comment_249223" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T21:06:11+00:00" title="December 30, 2009  9:06PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2009 9:08PM by Bill_White.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, what am I, chopped liver?<br/><br/>Um.<br/><br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD:  Eero, no fair playing the game <i>here</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249236/#Comment_249236" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-31T05:47:24+00:00" title="December 31, 2009  5:47AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ::throws in some onions::                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249244/#Comment_249244" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-31T07:42:06+00:00" title="December 31, 2009  7:42AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero is *totally*playing the game <i>here</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249249/#Comment_249249" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-31T09:06:52+00:00" title="December 31, 2009  9:06AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno...

I am fascinated by what I think of as the "communication dilemma of Diplomacy" in which sincerity and duplicity (and their concomitants, trust and discernment) are so finely balanced and thus so easily upset. In other words, if you "stab" someone, what judgments are you allowed to make about yourself and the other player, and under what circumstances? Is it unreasonable to feel bad about one's own act of betrayal in a game explicitly oriented toward such behavior? <br/><br/>By the same token, I enjoyed Eero's framing of the game as essentially an exercise in machismo, and I know it worked on me: I employed a Key Lepanto (i.e., as Austria,  letting an army from Venice into Trieste as a way of giving Italy an avenue of approach to attack Turkey) partly because Eero had suggested that such a move would demonstrate talent and aggressiveness on my part. It turned out to be a stupid move, because Italy decided to take advantage of the opening thus provided; if Christmas hadn't taken Nathan away from the game, I would have been history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249831/#Comment_249831" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-06T09:50:39+00:00" title="January  6, 2010  9:50AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most interesting aspect of the game, in that regard, for me, was my relationship with Bill (Austria). <br/><br/>As he mentions, he stabbed me early on, and we worked at cross purposes for about a turn, but the early game developed in such a way (Turkey, Austria and Russia all weak, with Italy strong and rather aggressive), that I had no choice but to forgive and forget.<br/><br/>I think our strong alliance for the rest of the game had a lot to do with that.

England liked to chat, so we speculated quite a bit about general Diplomacy philosophy and tactics and such. Meanwhile, Germany sent me a terse message about nobody moving to Burgundy. In hindsight this was obviously a preparation for stabbing, but I didn't have enough background on the players to know it, so I played it cool and kept my promises to both of my neighbours - France has this luxury, as she has SCs in depth in Iberia, so no need to move against anybody in particular on the first turn.<br/><br/>Later I found out that the Englishman had initiated a plot against myself from the very beginning, and had drafted Germany to be his cats-paw in a hazardous Mun-Bur maneuver. In the fall 1901 I still didn't know about the English part of the plot, so I just did my best to talk the eastern Powers into attacking the German's back to relieve the pressure against me. The German didn't play his part ruthlessly enough here - he chose to be a good boy and support England into Belgium instead of taking a SC from me; at the time I argued that he shouldn't take my SC, as I could always take it back (which was true), but taking one would still likely have been to his benefit for the tempo advantage - he'd have one extra unit for a year while I'd have to concentrate on getting him out of my home SCs.<br/><br/>All through the first year I pretty much ignored the rest of the board - I had plenty enough to do with my immediate neighbours. In hindsight the Russian decision to go hassle Germany probably directly contributed to his own downfall; Russia is fragile, and his neighbours are keen to react to any seeming weaknesses in his presence.<br/><br/>In the spring I exorcised Germany from Burgundy, while the Englishman showed his true colors by moving into the Channel. One of my great diplomatic feats in this game was that not only did Russia and Italy move to threaten Munich last year, but in the spring Russia actually supported Italy successfully into Munich! I have to confess that this was pretty gratifying, the German must have regretted attacking me so hazardously then. Of course actually possessing Munich is only worth a tempo advantage for Italy, as he can't leverage the position to do anything useful - Nathan played the position correctly in that he abandoned the SC later to take the army south against Austria.<br/><br/>I understand that many Powers tried to paint me as the Devil during the game, citing my supposedly superior experience with Diplomacy. The truth, though, is that I did not have particularly smooth sailing with my northern neighbour. In the fall of 1902 I survived with pure tactical brinkmanship, correctly predicting/directing (often the same thing in Diplomacy) that he'd leave Brest alone; relieved from defending it, I moved a risky MAO-Iri and thus balanced the tactical position - I was effectively waging war against both of my neighbours simultaneously and winning, which is no mean feat. Belgium was my reward there.<br/><br/>Next year I allied with Germany against England long enough to make sure the two wouldn't have enough unity to oppose me - material advantage always counts in the long term, so I had to make sure that the two would hang separately rather than stand together. The poor German apparently expected me to keep my promises, but his position was so vulnerable and mine already prepared for engulfing him, so the choice was easy.<br/><br/>While the German was harried by his eastern neighbours and England, the English position proved more difficult to break; attacking the island is always a bitch, and in this case the Englishman made few mistakes in the tactical realm. I could advance against him only with diplomatic means, making him doubt his tactics and encouraging him to focus on other opponents. Even then, slow going.<br/><br/>In 1904 Germany fell to mine and Russian troops - Russia was already in his death throes, so those SCs were as good as mine in many ways. Meanwhile Italy came to his zenith. At this point I'd talked England into disarming our fleet war by moving out of Iri myself (in actuality to protect MAO, but he interpreted it as willingness to turn south). In the fall I took advantage and moved to the Channel while the Englishman went to Nth. England had not been so close to a fall yet, and my plan seemed clear: I'd clear up Germany, build fleets and crush England, while Italy would keep the eastern Powers in check with his impressive empire. Our mutual borders seemed rather safe, as I didn't have troops in position and he didn't have a motivation to attack me.<br/><br/>The upset to this plan (and my best shot at a solo victory) came in 1905. England performed very well under pressure, not making any tactical mistakes, so there would be no quick victory for me there. But what's worse, the Italian leadership started deteriorating: first the moves became passive, then outright irrational and incomplete. There was even a complete NMR next year. I don't quite understand the thought processes in action here, but faith in my grand plan started to go when assimilating Germany slowed down (the German proved as tenacious as he had been gullible, fighting for Berlin) and the Italian started to make simply stupid moves that gave initiative back to his eastern opposition.<br/><br/>My English assault might have seemed grand in 1906 when I occupied London, but in actuality the move was mostly designed to intimidate - I'd have an easier time making peace with the tenacious Englishman if he saw me relinquish his capital as a gesture of good will. The eastern forces were clearly on the move at this point, meaning Turkey mostly. His decision to pass on a free SC in StP and the alliance with what remained of Austria after the Italian conquest were just worrisome, but the Italian passivity and the efficient progress of the Turkish fleet were more than that - it was obvious that I would have to get four fleets to the Med as soon as possible, or the Turk would break through and annex the southern half of my own empire. So I had little choice but to seek peace with England at this point, which was also the point at which I lost my realistic hopes of solo victory.<br/><br/>The last two years of the game were pretty single-minded from my viewpoint: the Turk was in a very strong position, and he would have surely won by a solo victory had somebody less experienced been playing France. As it was, I built an impregnable Mediterranean defense by drawing almost all of my fleet from the north and making some wise tactical calls. I took a good stalemate line, including Tunis, so Turkey had no theoretical long-term chances of a solo victory as long as the English didn't stab me in the back. (There are only 16 SCs on the eastern side of the final stalemate line we ended up occupying with England.) The northern situation was considerably easier, I annexed the Mun-Ber line while the Englishman secured StP against the solidifying Turkish front.<br/><br/>The endgame was pretty clearcut diplomatically: we had four players on the board, of which none had immediate tactical chances of a solo victory. We had rapidly stagnating military lines that would move only slowly or not at all in any direction. Should anybody wish to significantly change the positions, that would have to come about by starting a new war; as it was, we had Austria and Turkey against France and England. Our alliance with the Englishman was based on the eastern threat, we both expected and considered stabbing the other routinely, and would have done so were there any opportunity. I'm less clear on what happened in the east, to my eyes it seemed that the mongols had an irrational alliance: The Turk could have gotten rid of Austria years ago, but instead he kept the Austrian happy by feeding him any SCs they captured.<br/><br/>The endgame from my viewpoint was mostly about whether Austria and Turkey could be made to do war on each other. The main outcome of that would have been the destruction of Austria and a much more honorable 3-player draw; a potential secondary outcome would have been a tactical upset to my advantage, although I considered this a rather slim chance - the Englishman had proved an able player, and I didn't doubt that he'd attack me the second it seemed that I would benefit too much from the Austrian reduction. The reduction of the draw was the main goal, though, as that couldn't be achieved in any other way: none of the other three players was in a position to be realistically removed from the game without either me or Turkey achieving solo victory in the process.<br/><br/>I ultimately decided to offer the draw at the end of 1908 not because it was the best move, but because I hoped that Turkey would refuse it and signal willingness to get rid of Austria. So far my efforts at getting the two to break had been rebuffed in annoying ways (the Austrian especially communicated in a very annoying manner, his words full of thinly disguised lies), and I was severely doubting their rationality. To an outside observer it very much seemed that the two were not in an alliance of mutual benefit, but rather in some sort of American honor entanglement that had no other point but to mess up the game for the rest of us. Maybe the Turk didn't want to destroy Austria because he felt bad about stabbing a faithful ally? No idea, I on my part did my best to leave myself vulnerable to the Englishman, making it obvious that he would have the means to keep me in check while the Austrian reduction took place.<br/><br/>We discussed the draw in length with the Englishman before he accepted it, going through the various other options. Presuming that nothing would be able to convince Turkey to attack Austria and go for a three-player draw, we even considered the option of giving the whole of Germany to Austria in the hopes of provoking an Austrian independence struggle. This was deemed too hazardous in the end, as the Austrian had shown no sign of manly thirst for victory - the Austrian might have just continued pushing against me blindly while the Turk might have maneuvered into position to actually achieve the full 18 SCs by walking over the Mun-Ber stalemate line.<br/><br/>In the end the logic was clear: the only player who could have effectively initiated a reduction in Powers was Turkey, and he obviously refused to do so, as signified by his willingness to settle for a four-player draw. So I don't blame the Englishman for the wimpy outcome, he was just reading the writing on the wall when he accepted it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249893/#Comment_249893" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-06T23:03:26+00:00" title="January  6, 2010 11:03PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scoring</b><br/><br/>Props to the English and the Austrian, they both showed grit in the game. The English made no major mistakes in the game, and consequently fought himself into the draw against an aggressive neighbour intent on his destruction. The Austrian, on the other hand, managed a feat few have by bringing Austria back from two SCs - this was mostly the Turk missing the ball, it seemed from the western part of the board, but in Diplomacy it's often impossible to tell which impulses are instigated and which are natural; for all I know, the Austrian manipulated the Turk all the way. And in the end-game the Austrian made all the right calls, evidently, as we were forced to accept his part in the new world order.<br/><br/>Looking at the game as a whole, I can't say that it would have been much of a challenge for our Diplomacy skills. We just played a bit, had all the deadwood drop off, and ended up with the four players who actually cared enough to play to the end. That's a bit of a too nasty characterization for the German game; he played badly in that he gravely misjudged the motivations of his neighbours, but he stuck it out to the end and only gave up when the Englishman helped me remove him from the board. The Russian play was a bit worse than that in some ways (mostly in being non-directed and not forceful enough), but the main prize for weak-ass play in this case has to go to the Italian - he had the keys to the kingdom, but he flubbed it totally. I might be biased in this, as the total Italian failure directly forced me to abandon my own imperium-building dreams, but that was one dramatic reversal of fortunes for a Power that usually has its largest problems in getting from four SCs to five.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249906/#Comment_249906" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T06:16:04+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  6:16AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, that's a great - if naturally Franco-centric - summation of the game.

The first two go together: I should have backed Germany up better after he went into Burgundy.  If I was going to stab him, I should have done it more thoroughly and not the half-assed thing that I did where I occupied the Channel and turned Eero against me at the same time.  Poorly conceived orders those.  The other mistake was just the fleet malfunction in Denmark.  Stupid.<br/><br/>On the whole, I found the first few turns to be the most satisfying.  The initial jockeying for position, seeking alliances, making contact; that was fun.  The ending of the game was very disappointing, we ended up with a draw for everybody that stuck with it (except Germany, who deserved better than he got).<br/><br/>That said, I'm pretty much ready to set up a new game.

(since that seems to be important to you) -- strategy of demonizing you, being loyal to Turkey, keeping the lines open with England, and hoping that mutual exhaustion would set in so that I would still be on the board when the game ended: a draw is still a victory, and there was no way I was going to be able to pull off a solo win. I had to rely on Brian to not have the heart to stab me, which may have been "meta-gaming" but a person still has to look at himself in the mirror when the game is done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249916/#Comment_249916" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T07:59:13+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  7:59AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I'm uncertain how much of this communications style is sincere, and how much is a holdover from the game. <br/><br/>Some comments from Turkey...<br/><br/>1. I didn't leave Austria in the game out of some misguided "American honor", nor did I make some sort of blunder. My alliance with Austria was strong, and a strong alliance is valuable in Diplomacy. Stabbing him in the end game would have just thrown it to England and France.<br/><br/>Also, tactically speaking, in a mid-game where Austria is his strongest ally, Turkey has little choice but to give him new SCs. The difficulty of bringing new units from Turkey's home centers is enormous. If I trusted Austria, which I mostly did, it made more sense to let him get builds,m because he could put new units directly into the fight.<br/><br/>2. I was happy to end the game where we ended it.

Being discourteous towards me in the communications wasn't a necessary part there, but your actual choices were solid: had you been swayed to attack Turkey, it would have likely gone badly for you, especially as the situation solidified and became simpler. In this case my uncertainty about your sanity did not play against you at all - a lucky turn, as my experience would indicate that most of the time it's smart to present a rational and reasonable facade towards others just in case you need to actually accomplish something with them. You could have just as well explained to me that you're shooting for a 4-way draw on the presumption that the Turk wouldn't stab you - no need for clowning around. I stand by what I said: you didn't express a concerned thirst for victory, but rather exhibited all the signs of a player who isn't taking the game seriously anymore and is just along for the ride, waiting for his puppeteer to stab him out of his misery. Had you discussed the situation frankly, I'm sure I'd have gauged your motivations differently; of course that wouldn't have changed the outcome.<br/><br/>Also, incidentally: I meant no manipulation in my initial 1901 messages at the Italo-Austrian partnership, and never adviced the Italian to attack Austria. My motivation towards the east was nothing more or less than to preserve a balance of power in the area by encouraging Austria and Italy to get over their initial border dispute and present a common front against the eastern Powers. My general experience is that in games of uneven skill Turkey and Russia are prone to ally against Austria, for which reason it is imperative for the Austrian to work out an alliance with Italy. Apparently Nathan liked a partition more, although I did warn him that partitioning Austria while Turkey is still operational tends to be to the Turk's advantage.<br/><br/>The player whose endgame I was somewhat surprised at was the Turk, who chose to keep Austria around when he had the choice to do differently. I have to confess that I do not quite understand his logic there - even right to the end it would have been relatively safe to just refuse the draw, attack Austria and make this a 3-way draw instead of 4-way. (I could not interfere because the Englishman would've kept me in check.) Results do not lie, which is why I consider the Austrian to have played correctly here - but had I been playing Turkey, he would have been a goner.<br/><br/>I don't say that the Turk played wrong there, I should clarify. He might have been operating under a reasonable assumption that the Englishman couldn't or wouldn't stop me from claiming a solo victory, should he break the alliance with Austria and thus allow me to attack the east in strength. I happen to know that this is a wrong assumption (the Englishman repeatedly demonstrated to me both the skill and the understanding necessary to ruthlessly grab a third of my empire the moment I'd allow him the chance), but the Turk might have thought differently. This is certainly a more honorable assumption than thinking that the Turk pitied the Austrian and didn't want to stab an ally.<br/><br/>(I probably should say a few words about why that endgame situation was so asymmetric: the reason for why I couldn't just ally with Austria against Turkey was that the Austrian core position is in the middle of the board, while the Turk is in the farthermost corner from myself. To get at the Turk would require me to go through Austria, which same problem was faced by the Turk coming the other way, of course. The Austrian position is weak in this sort of end-game exactly because she is often the only Power that <i>can</i> be eliminated without unrealistic contortions and extreme risk of solo victory on the parts of other players. So that's why my analysis constantly comes back to the issue of Austrian destruction - we had to get rid of him or nobody at all, the geopolitics didn't allow other solutions. The Austrian could allay his weakness by turning against Turkey and cleverly clearing him out before the end-game, but in this case that was obviously rather impossible for the weakened Austrian.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249927/#Comment_249927" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T08:42:09+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  8:42AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian: I don't want to fight, I think that you have a right to a tactical opinion, and even if its wrong, that's OK - we make mistakes in strategy games all the time. This is purely out of academic interest: what do you mean by saying that attacking Austria would have "thrown the game to England and France"? I genuinely don't understand, and I'm starting to suspect that you are operating from a misunderstanding of the rules - you sent me a puzzling message on 1907 where you counted the SC counts of the two alliances still on the board, which puzzled me in this same way: what does it matter whether an alliance has 17 or 18 SCs?<br/><br/>When I say that I don't understand that bit about throwing the game to England and France, what I mean is that to me it seems that you can't really throw the game in Diplomacy to a two-player alliance. What would we have done, the two of us, even if you left yourself completely open? Assuming that you'd be able to destroy Austria, <i>you would have assured your place in a 3-player draw</i>. You wouldn't even have to defend yourself after destroying Austria, it's a virtual impossibility for a three-player draw to get reduced to a two-player one. The only danger in that situation is that a <i>single</i> player gains a solo victory, but how would that have been possible with England in a minor position, but situated at my back? England could not possibly have acted efficiently enough to make use of the chaos in central Europe had you attacked Austria, but he certainly had plenty of troops to stop me from going for a solo victory. This is an almost universal property of three-player boards in Diplomacy: the third player is almost impossible to remove without having one of the other players gain a solo victory. Just imagine: the two players would have to cooperate in a war against the third player, gaining SCs all the time, but <i>without either ever gaining 18 SCs</i>. How could you possibly manage this against an active opponent who is ready and willing to use diplomatic threats and, ultimately, ready to throw the game to one of the players should the other refuse to stop his aggression? How can you do it, when your "ally" calculates every turn carefully and just waits, waits for the opportunity to pick the <i>one</i> extra SC he needs for total victory? It's a purely theoretical construct, there is no feasible two-player draw in this game when played without collusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249932/#Comment_249932" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T09:02:15+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  9:02AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Incidentally, please anybody tell me if my aftergame analysis is discourteous and I should stop gushing. I like Diplomacy and I like figuring out how to play it, so I might sound scary zealous about it.<br/><br/>Brian, stalemate lines: The reason for why you couldn't have won a long-term war against the western alliance without an internal fracture is that at the end of the game we were amply positioned on strong stalemate lines on both the southern and northern front. In the north it was already a done deal, and in the south it would have become so once I brought one more fleet into the area; I would have had ample time for this, as you were already in a position where your only chance would be to somehow smuggle a fleet into Piedmont - a process fraught with guesswork, as I could harass it at will. Even if you could have managed it before I brought in a fifth fleet to lock the position down for good, I could always retreat to the next position - there is another stalemate line on Mar-Spa-MAO, one that is considerably easier to defend. Losing Tun to you wouldn't mean anything anyway, as that wouldn't bring you to a solo quorum even if you succeeded in destroying Austria without losing position to anybody.<br/><br/>(A "stalemate line" in Diplomacy is a perfect defensive position that cannot be breached because the board geography allows the defender to bring more force to bear than the attacker can. Two of the most famous ones are Mun-Ber and Mar-GoL-Wes-Tun. Fully manning a stalemate line is rarely efficient, but their existence is an important consideration in end-game negotiations, as players can often force the game to end by demonstrating the ability to utilize a stalemate line. For example, in this game I imagined that everybody would share my simple conviction that France was practically untouchable as long as England didn't decide to attack his vulnerable northern flank. Apparently we were playing with somewhat different tactical analysis, which is of course always interesting.

A laundry list of where others failed or played sub-optimally, accompanied by an assurance that, had YOU been in their position, it wouldn't have happened that way ... that's super annoying to read. <br/><br/>To answer your questions which are actually questions ...<br/><br/>1. I assumed that if I stabbed Austria, he would have joined the alliance against me, even if doing so meant he went out of the game. Because that's often what people do in Diplomacy. Two vs two is better than three vs one, even if the geography of our alliance made it awkward.<br/><br/>2. I'm familiar with the concept of stalemate lines. But it seemed possible to turn England against France. In fact, prior to the draw, I think that's the way it was going, although Jamey can tell is if that's the case.<br/><br/>3. Most significantly ... I don't consider the four-way draw to be a great strategic and personal failure (as opposed to the three-way draw). <br/><br/>Because ... the four-way draw was more fun for me as a player of the game. <br/><br/>Stabbing Austria would have made the game less fun. England and I had rather fraught communications, and France ignored all my messages for the latter third of the game.  So taking out my only ally and continuing a grim "tactical moves only" slog through the end of the game just to get a three-way draw didn't seem appealing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249947/#Comment_249947" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T10:15:19+00:00" title="January  7, 2010 10:15AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry about the condescendence, I don't really mean to sound that way. Of course I made mistakes myself as well, and would have likely made different mistakes had I played other positions. It's just that mistakes are where we learn, so I naturally gravitate towards those in analysis. Doesn't help that I've been teaching Diplomacy to teenagers around here for the last couple of years, so I've gotten into a lecturing habit.<br/><br/>I would have assumed that Austria would fight against you as well if you decided to stab him. I wouldn't expect him to have major chances, though, exactly because of the overall strategic situation I've described: Austria in the middle of the board is in the middle of a ravenous wolf-pack, each member of which is doing its very best to make sure the others don't get enough of a bite to grow into real threats. So it might be that you'd get the lion's portion of Austria, it might be that I'd get it... wouldn't matter, as SC counts don't matter as long as 18 hasn't been crossed.<br/><br/>I don't consider your estimations of the situation unreasonable at all, hearing them from you - my own impression of England's play was very different, but it would obviously be, as we didn't sit in on each other's discussions. I got a very rational impression out of him, but that might have been because Mr. Rationalman himself was in those discussions as well. At the end I would have been very, very surprised had he made the mistake of attacking me - we'd hashed out the benefits and drawbacks of attacking me multiple times at that point, after all, and concluded that the most he'd get from that would be 3-4 SCs and a chance for Turkey to go solo if I made a mistake in defending on two fronts. Likewise, the chance of him happily allying with me and Austria to attack Turkey long-term... not going to happen, or I'd have taught him nothing thought the game <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>(Also, sorry about not talking to you for the last couple of years. I didn't want to inadvertently give you info, as you really did have a chance at breaking through in the south with a lucky move at one point. I decided that my chances of succeeding in a risky maneuver like the 1908 spring were better if you'd play purely your own game without my interference.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249981/#Comment_249981" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T15:22:48+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  3:22PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>(the German proved as tenacious as he had been gullible, fighting for Berlin)</blockquote>\nHey now! The only time I was gullible was when I trusted that England would follow through on our initial alliance against you, rather than getting greedy and stabbing me. You're correct that I should have gone for the third center in the first year rather than supporting England into Belgium; that would have kept me in a strong position for the alliance, and also made it harder for the Russian-Italian attack on Munich. However, letting England take Belgium seemed like a better idea in the end, as it was assured to work and kept us even in units, which I hoped would also keep our alliance solid. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>The poor German apparently expected me to keep my promises, but his position was so vulnerable and mine already prepared for engulfing him, so the choice was easy.</blockquote>\nOn the contrary, as I told you and everyone else, I expected you to abide by agreements just as long as necessary to get your advantage, at which point you'd turn and stab again. As you say, in my position, with no one willing to back me up or even respond to my messages, I had no choice but to go along with your suggestions. Indeed, if I'd been able to keep up with the game, taking Berlin at the end as you suggested was my only choice to stay in. <br/><br/>You're throwing a lot of criticism at Turkey for not gobbling up Austria, but it's equally clear that either you or England should have gone after the other, and you never stuck by it. When England was at four units to your nine, he was just a year from downfall, but you didn't follow through on that. <br/><br/>Also, you talked a lot during the game about how busy you were going to be, with your new restaurant opening, and I have no doubt that you were truthful about that, but you ended up being a lot more engaged and reachable than I expected. Indeed, part of the reason I decided to work with England against you in the first place was that I anticipated not being able to have meaningful diplomacy with you, because of your claims that you'd be too busy to talk much. <br/><br/>On the flip side of that, I unexpectedly had a lot of work come in last minute, to be done during the weeks I went back to my parents' for Christmas. So by Christmas weekend I was just flat-out too busy to put much time and thought into the game, and having been reduced to only two units with even my erstwhile allies, whom I could have benefitted, no longer responding to my messages, I saw little point in continuing to engage with the game\u2014if no one was even willing to lie to me about making plans, I clearly wasn't going to survive long anyhow. So you're being dismissive about Italy's actions and mine, but the fact is, my life got busy and was more important than keeping up with the game, and I expect that\u2014just as Nathan's told us\u2014that was true for Italy as well. (I don't know whether Ben also got too busy to keep up with Russia, or whether he just gave in to the inevitable, but he definitely came out the worst from the jockeying for position. Ironically, blocking him from taking Sweden ensured both our downfalls.)<br/><br/>Oh I do want to add that I know I got to be rather snarky in some of my communications, particularly with England, so perhaps it's not too surprising that people stopped replying to me.<br/><br/>I could probably use another week or so as a break, but I am still interested in playing another game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249985/#Comment_249985" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T15:30:28+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  3:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, with Diplomacy, it's hard to judge what's going on based SOLELY on looking at the board.<br/><br/>So when we posted screenshots in this thread, some people who weren't playing said some stuff that didn't necessarily compute.

Might be that a potential player misses the announcement here.<br/><br/>Philip: I didn't think your play that bad, you struggled valiantly and kept it together even after losing your home SCs. Your early play wasn't the best (going to Burgundy is risky, as we demonstrated, and it's doubly so if you give Belgium to England right off the bat), but you steadily improved through the game and would surely dominate another round. The reason for why I spared England when I was on the brink of delivering a death blow was that I couldn't have done it fast enough and still prevented Turkey from overrunning my southern border. Tactical tricks aside, this was probably my single best contribution to the game - I've seen similar situations played wrong again and again by players who overestimate their own flexibility, underestimate the tenacity of their victim or think that for some reason, surely the nice musulman won't be coming to the Atlantic when given half a chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250287/#Comment_250287" name="Item_183" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T05:38:33+00:00" title="January 11, 2010  5:38AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're up to seven!
