Primitive, even. Do you have any insight into the historical causes of how it's come to be like this? Are gamers self-selected out of social and geographical areas where men hate women, or what?<br/><br/>My attention, personally, is attracted to the nature of the host culture and how it interacts with the insular gamer subculture. On the one hand it's obvious that the tight-knit fraternity enables its members socially (also in being assholes), but it's equally evident that the fraternity itself grows in the context of its host culture - its members bring their own concerns and insecurities into the subculture to fester. Thus the witch's brew reported upon in that article seems to be the outcome of the US gaming culture being historically populated by a strong majority of white men, many of them socially under-performing; it's become a self-maintaining institution that attracts many kinds of people who have difficulties adapting to a complex society. Apparently some of those types are not merely shy, but racists and misogynists who find an environment willing to tolerate and foster their quirks. As we all know only too well, gaming culture often has rather low, low standards for who we'll associate with as long as they play the right games.<br/><br/>Some of these elements are present in the Finnish gaming culture as well, but being as how it arises in a different host culture, the details are different. The conservative tendency to foster and support its members, and to be accepting of their faults, is there, as is the generally relatively low social standard (in e.g. expectations of dress and polite behaviour). My understanding is that misogyny is not as prevalent, which I believe to be a function of the host culture being somewhat less misogynic in general, and not some special feature of the Finnish gamer - I believe that if we simply had more misogynic people here and less rapid values against it, the fostering effect of gaming culture would certainly protect them in the same way here as well. As it is, the standards of the mainstream culture override the fostering effect, so that e.g. groping could probably not be passed off as a "joke" - I would expect your gaming friends to drop you like a hot potato were you outed as a groper. I also have the sense that gaming is less subcultural here than it is in the US, which means that the entire fraternity is not as absolutely protected within its own little echo chamber in how we dress and speak and act and believe - as gaming is seen as one culture hobby among others, its participants are expected to act like everybody else, according to the same rules of politeness and decorum.<br/><br/>I am, obviously, not saying that I'm the right fellow to decide whether this problem exists here in Finland, and to what degree. To whatever extent it does, I hope that people will continue to speak up about it, so as to give us the opportunity to affirm our commitment to a society of equality - presumably that helps in forwarding the message that the majority does not consider this kind of thing acceptable. I for one do not want to give gamers any sort of a socio-political "pass" on running a secondary society with its own rules alongside ordinary everyday life. Being an expert on D&amp;D does not give you the right to act like an animal whenever you feel like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452033/#Comment_452033" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-05T10:31:25+00:00" title="April  5, 2016 10:31AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've had a very, very long discussion on the Dansih rpgforum facebook group about this article, and one thing that came out was that there are several women-only groups where this problem has been dsicussed for years. <br/>I stated in that discussion that one of the problems was that the majority of male gamers were unaware of the problem. We'd simply never been told. But the reason for this is that the women complaining about the problem have almost all been told by authority figures to not rock the boat.<br/>This, of course, exacerbates the problem. The majority can't be instrumental in solving a problem it doesn't know exists, and at the same time, I understand perfectly well why the victims haven't spoken up about it. I wish they'd cried it from the rooftops.<br/>In our thread we now have numerous examples, all anonymized, of course, but very plausible. The real names are know by the poster, and more and more are sharing their stories in public. I don't doubt their veracity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452047/#Comment_452047" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-05T22:51:48+00:00" title="April  5, 2016 10:51PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2016 10:52PM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd call it a "male terrorist problem" here in my country, more than a "white..." and as stated in the article, it's a problematic present in all hobbies. In peruvian culture, in the 90's, social problems (like common terrorism performed by organized paramilitary groups and acute economical crisis) prevented communities from forming and developing, until late 90's with a boom in anime related media. Then several clubs and magazines gathered people around and like waging tribes they declared a somewhat cold war against each other. Things like cosplay were unheard of and from my knowledge, the reason that a higher part of the active community were male was more about the general insecurity still present in society.<br/><br/>We had to wait until late 00's for our first conventions, which started mostly as anime-themed parties, so until then, you only had the same problematics you would have in non-hobbie related parties, which are about the same. I've got no idea about how much of these issues were present at the moment. Nobody here has made studies about it, but I'm sure there has been.<br/><br/>Because I was groped by a girl (probably under 18 at that day) at one event I organized myself. I kept it quiet, though I admit that it's different for men. If you get groped by a girl, you're supposed to be proud. If you get groped by a man, you are totally justified to retaliate and hit whoever touched you. But if he is physically superior and fear gets the better from you, you can only shut up and pretend it never happened. I still don't know how to feel about whatever happened at that event. However I know I don't feel proud at all.<br/><br/>But from this I can take my imagination (and I've got tons of that) two steps furter and try to get a bit in the place of the actual victims, so I get the sheer terror. It's totally unfair to blame them.<br/><br/>Now that we're getting more cons in my country, I figure the problem is increasing, though it still hasn't seen enough public light; I hope there could be some way to solve even before it reaches that point, as the community in my country is weak enough that a couple of scandals like this could wipe it for years again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452048/#Comment_452048" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-06T00:34:44+00:00" title="April  6, 2016 12:34AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing this, Paul; important and devastating article. I'm struggling to channel my despair about the situation into useful action.<br/><br/>My experience tells me that men with these toxic attitudes and behaviors also tend to lack the emotional maturity to have productive conversations on the topic. And it seems like a high bar for the rest of us to be both courageous enough to broach the topic and skillful enough to affect positive transformation.<br/><br/>I guess my struggle is, is the question, "how can we positively transform toxic people?", or is it, "how can we effectively identify and expel toxic people from the community?"<br/><br/>Like, once a man has committed an act of terror, it doesn't feel like enough to say, "keep your mysoginist attitudes, but supress the associated behaviors while in this space." The presence of the attitude is enough by itself to poison the safety of the space. the subtle ickiness of game spaces is a big deterrent for my wife and other women I play games with, and the nebulous and deniable nature of it leaves me stumped. But its that subtle ickiness that fosters the terror.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452051/#Comment_452051" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-06T01:43:30+00:00" title="April  6, 2016  1:43AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My impression is that gaming, like any hobby:<br/>- attracts all sorts of people, many of whom are awesome<br/>- draws its worst people, and encounters their worst behavior, at events centered on hobbyist identity<br/><br/>I am a huge Mets fan, but I never want to sit in the stadium section where everyone's wearing Mets jerseys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452052/#Comment_452052" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-06T01:49:33+00:00" title="April  6, 2016  1:49AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2016 1:50AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I guess my struggle is, is the question, "how can we positively transform toxic people?", or is it, "how can we effectively identify and expel toxic people from the community?"</blockquote>I'd say you can play the long game and the short game simultaneously.

The biggest roleplaying convention in Sweden has a room for HBTQ and women, so they have an area at the convention that they can feel secure in. That's just one measure that has been taken to both show and create awareness of the situation.<br/><br/>The view of women is a problem in society, but I guess some work can be done in our hobby, like don't allow certain misogynistic characters in some scenarios, show strong female characters, and make some fantasy worlds equal instead of trying to blame "realism" to put women in oppressed situations - it's \xbbfantasy\xab for God's sake.<br/><br/>And then we got all the online threats to women that actually speaks up. At least show support for them. Listen to women that has something to say, instead of ignoring them, protecting your convention/scenario, or - worst case scenario - blame them for it.<br/><br/>Here is an article about the sexual abuse in LARP culture that was a hot topic last year here in Sweden. So hot it even got the attention from the Swedish press:<br/><a href="http://spelkult.se/vittnesmal/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://spelkult.se/vittnesmal/</a> (Swedish)<br/><a href="http://spelkult.se/testimonies/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://spelkult.se/testimonies/</a> (English)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452054/#Comment_452054" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-06T04:07:50+00:00" title="April  6, 2016  4:07AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the wonderful discussion, everyone. This is certainly enlightening.<br/><br/>David and I were having a conversation about this, and about doing something which could improve the situation. We quickly realized that, were we to take some course of action, we would likely face public backlash of some sort (David has a better sense of the specifics than I; he made a pretty thorough list).<br/><br/>The realization that even trying to fix the problem as a white, male gamer could potentially be dangerous (or at least risk exposing oneself to some serious internet harassment or other threats) really puts this whole discussion into perspective. I can only imagine the pressures present on someone who feels like an outsider and discriminated against to begin with.<br/><br/>One hopeful note:<br/><br/>I was reading an article about the continued prevalence of racism in the United States. The statistics they collected in the process of putting together this article were incredibly troubling. However, one extremely positive finding they exposed was that, generally speaking, in most situations where a problem was made to be publicly known, it would disappear. Make enough people aware that a problem exists, and the general majority will (sooner or later) act to diminish that problem, or even make it vanish altogether. People who are aware of their biases will find those biases diminishing over time, generally speaking. Now that they know it's something real, enough of them will compensate to create a better future for everyone.<br/><br/>That's a hopeful thing, I think; it speaks well of humanity in general, and also of our chances of beating this kind of thing. My takeaway is: don't be afraid to raise these discussions, educate people, and make sure that those who might not normally speak up have a chance to do so.

Prior to that I thought people like Thunderfoot were credible, because he debunked creationists (easy prey really) and because...reasons. The problem is that these issues are subtle at the heart. Concepts like Patriarchy are subtle and easily misunderstood by MRA types who take to everything like a blunt instrument. <br/><br/>Attitudes toward women are not easily understood by men because men simply don't have the same experiences. That's not a blame thing, it's truth. Unfortunately there is a rhetoric at the moment that paints men as the victim and feminism as the oppressor - just because feminists want to redress the balance. <br/><br/>It's very sad that this issue gets the predictable treatment that it has from certain sources. In fact I see the rpgsite has resorted to some of the lowest behaviour imaginable in forum conduct from those assuming that the woman in question is being, at best, hyperbolic. This is exactly the sort of marginalising dismissive behaviour she talks about as the user in question, defending the article's author's position (if not her character), gets banned as a result. Don't forget the Pundit's constant exhortations of free speech either.<br/><br/>Sexism is everywhere, sadly. The use of certain words, the prevalence of certain attitudes (take for instance the notion of 'rape' in video games that trivialises the act), are deep rooted and defended by insecure people who immediately go on the harrowingly defensive the moment anyone speaks out. It is very hard to get through to people, particularly when they are listening to those (like Thunderfoot for example) that make a living skewing the truth to make their point.<br/><br/>I don't know if this woman was genuinely harassed as she claims. But if she, or others, do experience this (and doubtless some do), then it must stop and be immediately challenged.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452125/#Comment_452125" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-11T11:05:06+00:00" title="April 11, 2016 11:05AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2016 11:05AM by Potemkin.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all so disturbing.

I think many spaces have inherited an ethos of "we must be inclusive, especially to awful losers who are gamers because they've found rejection elsewhere," and I'd destroy that bullshit wherever I could.</blockquote>\nA few years back now I found myself running a large student union gaming society at a respectable redbrick university in the north of England. The membership was diverse and the ethos was vigorously all-inclusive. We really were one of the few places where the alienated, anxious and socially maladjusted could find some community, support and fun. I'm proud of what we did as a society and I would hate to see the ethos of inclusivity, one of its best qualities, disappear from gaming. <br/><br/>That said, ye gods, if I wasn't always on my feet putting out fires. Dealing with the socially maladjusted - yes, the awful losers - can be a full time job. I had quite a time pulling grown men to one side to explain that their language or behaviour wasn't going to be tolerated and what the consequences would be if apologies and corrections weren't forthcoming. <br/><br/>There were challenges and spectacular failures but in the end we learnt that persevering to educate and socialise offenders enhanced our inclusivity. One guy prone to sexist comments went on to be a groomsman an his victim's wedding. I take that as a victory for our community but it was hard won. <br/><br/>My presidential fiat and bully-tactics weren't perfect and - while I hate to say it - I think I failed many members of my society. The worst offenders would leave to find private groups that would accept their bigotry (intentional or unconscious) and breed sexism and intolerance outside of my oversight. These viper nests would often rear their ugly heads at the worst times, especially online. <br/><br/>There's not much that can be done about online misconduct, sadly. But we must, as a community, keep our ethos of inclusivity and we must demand that the institutions, companies and organisers that service our community strive to make our spaces safe and free from bigotry, crime and fear. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452126/#Comment_452126" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-11T12:44:23+00:00" title="April 11, 2016 12:44PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experiences are somewhat similar to Potemkin's, especially in that I've often seen the other side of the gamer inclusivity coin - how it feels to essentially act as a social charity as your gaming club, circle or group attracts the geeky sort of people (here understood strictly as the more or less socially maladjusted). On the one hand you have the series of problems of which misogynism is one striking example, but on the other hand you have this sort of a noble, charitable tradition of trying to help people engage with society at all - of trying to build towards functional creative cooperation with your co-players, frankly, as it seems that the creative cooperation necessary for complex gaming is a big part of why the culture is the way it is to begin with. I recognize in myself an instinctual habit to accept, emphasize and try to support the geeky drifters in our lives, the ones without much in the way of work or love life, for whom the gaming is often their most important social capital, even when they're not very good at it.<br/><br/>This background makes a proposition of "banning the basement dwellers" somewhat more complex socially than it would be for some less inclusive hobby. The vast majority of the gaming microclimates I've witnessed don't practice <i>any</i> collective standards whatsoever, which practically idealizes a sort of implicit consensus that arises out of small interactions over the years. Bringing a broom to this environment can have a high threshold, socially speaking, as whoever decides to openly talk about the community values and goals of the group will be the bad guy who rocks the boat that will probably have been swimming just fine for most of the participants. In other words, it is exactly the sort of social environment where I would expect pits of old-fashioned vileness to survive and flourish, as nobody has the capacity to judge and demand better.<br/><br/>I haven't had to address much in the way of misogynism in this way over the years (feel free to decide yourself whether it's because it's not very common around here, or because I'm blind to it, or what), but I'll give a parallel example of how the social standards in gaming seem to work:                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452127/#Comment_452127" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-11T12:44:37+00:00" title="April 11, 2016 12:44PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2016 12:48PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Dealing with a difficult player, a real life parable</b><br/><br/>Over a decade back I started an open D&amp;D campaign at the university gaming club in Helsinki, meaning that the campaign took in whoever drifted in over the first couple of years - later on this campaign turned into a circle of friends who've been playing together for 15 years at this point, so in general scope it's been entirely successful, taking in new players to this day regularly, and being probably the most high-profile "open table" in Helsinki in general. Can't be entirely unsuccessful if you've got your own IRC channel <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The core group of the social circle that developed around that D&amp;D campaign is composed of nerdy men, very typical tabletop gamers. (Not a misogynism story here, as far as I can discern the long-term gravitation towards a homosocial setup has mostly been due to creative interests of similar people being similar, and D&amp;D being some hardcore geek shit in the first place.) I would characterize the social baseline of the group as reasonably well-adjusted - the members mostly have a social life, deal with strangers both inside and outside the hobby, wash themselves, exercise and so on, all that basic stuff, despite most leaning pretty clearly towards geeky hobbies and lifestyle choices.<br/><br/>However, for a long time the group also had a particularly socially maladjusted participant. This started in my D&amp;D campaign already, so I became intimately familiar with his creative habits, and the way they rubbed against those of the other players. This isn't a really dramatic horror story or anything, the guy was mostly fine socially - over-keen and not very perceptive, as geeks often are socially, but otherwise fine. However, he was very disruptive in a game due to a tendency to create bizarre characters, play them chaotically and swap characters all the time as he grew bored with the last one, or the last character died on him (which happened regularly in D&amp;D due to how the game sort of encourages chaotic stupid characters dying). He was generally not very well attached to the actual events on-going in the campaign, and you would get the impression that the creative communication between the two of you was in some way incomplete, like he was looking for something other than what the game was trying to focus on.<br/><br/>This tendency was bad enough that it regularly derailed the game and made it difficult for others to enjoy it over the years, as the problem player's most recent character would become the center of attention by being difficult to integrate in the group, or by doing something stupid (your basic "I attack the king" bullshit, basically), or by simply dying in a long-winded manner to some stupid, stupid situation. The sheer overhead of the character creation cycle was something of a burden, as he would often play a given character for only one session, meaning that we'd just spent e.g. 20% of a session incorporating a new player character for no long-term benefit whatsoever, at least until we learned to just not care and let him bring in new characters like the adventuring party had a revolving door for PCs.<br/><br/>(I am sure that most of you have had similar experiences, I think that this particular sort of pathology is pretty common to gamers - the person I'm describing is not nearly the only sad geek struggling with his inner demons at a D&amp;D table I've ever encountered, he's just special in how many years we ended up playing with him.)<br/><br/>Coming to my point: in a more results-oriented hobby culture, where one cared about the results of the activity, a player whose performance stuck out like that would have been ousted a long time ago. However, acting upon the inclusive standards it does, our group bore with this creative dynamic for years and years. I think it was something like four or five years of regular weekly play, before one time the player himself decided that he would not be coming back; I sadly wasn't in Helsinki myself at the time, so don't know the details of what changed, but my impression is that it wasn't that anybody had particularly grown balls and kicked him out - rather, it probably was that the mounting collective sense of frustration with him piled up and started being evident even to socially clueless geeks to such an extent that he finally picked up on it himself and went off in a huff.<br/><br/>Thus, what I view as the basic model of community policing in the gaming hobby: a difficult peer is dealt with by patiently forbearing them for years on end, never talking about any problems, never doing anything proactive to improve upon what you perceive as problems. Who blinks first loses, as then they're the evil ones rocking the boat, while you get to be the virtuous person who had nothing to do with the interpersonal drama. Just here to play, yes sir, I've no horse whatever in that race - y'all just feel free to continue using the gaming table as a communal toilet, I'm too timid to complain. That's your basic geek strategy of communal coordination.<br/><br/>My story is about a gamer whose only sin was and is that he's maybe not very good at it ("it" being both D&amp;D and general creative coordination with others). However, if I had to guess, I'd say that the group would react with pretty similar social tools to e.g. a raging misogynist (or racist, as seems likelier in this bold new era of Finnish fascism), were one to grace our gaming table. The only reason that we can hold onto any honor regarding this problem player episode is that the non-committal, socially passive forbearance of the group ultimately harmed only ourselves by being very, very annoying at times. Maybe we would act more decisively as a group if the issue was bigotry rather than mild PTSD-induced (the guy had a background as a mercenary, of all things) gaming incompetence, but I am personally doubtful - at the very least it would require one of us to take the lead in community policing in an unfamiliar way. I foresee it as likelier that the group would attempt to stay non-committal, letting the people "not getting along" fight it out among themselves. In other words, in a woman vs. misogynist fight a rpg group like this would probably tacitly support the bigot - not because the majority are particularly bigoted, but simply because the social rule is to not impose your own standards on others, not even when that standard is some basic shit one would assume you'd have picked up in pre-school already.<br/><br/>Which brings my long-winded rambling to a conclusion of sorts: whether the article linked in that OP is relevant to my own situation right here and now is somewhat besides the point, as the real benefit is in developing responses and ideological positions about this stuff in case we need them later. As we can see from my case study, at least this particular gaming circle of mine cannot boast an active history of upholding community standards; insofar as we're not already a pit of bigotry, it's more of a function of the general Helsinki society than anything the group itself has done to maintain conscious standards. This is a valuable realization for the day when let's say a muslim immigrant wants to join the game and we discover that some particularly eurofascist member of the group just can't let it go, and we'll need to choose between the bigotry and the immigrants. (Just a slightly more realistic bigotry scenario for here and now, as I'm having real difficulty imagining these guys revealing unplumbed depths of misogynism at this late date.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452129/#Comment_452129" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-11T13:47:37+00:00" title="April 11, 2016  1:47PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW since the Pundit banned me for talking about an rpg he didn't like (because...free speech) please respond to my posts here, since that's where I made them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452131/#Comment_452131" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-11T15:12:24+00:00" title="April 11, 2016  3:12PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>BTW since the Pundit banned me for talking about an rpg he didn't like (because...free speech) please respond to my posts here, since that's where I made them. </blockquote>\nYou should have heard him bellyaching on G+ about a game being temporarily pulled on DT because they were - quite properly - following their complaints procedures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452132/#Comment_452132" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-11T15:15:23+00:00" title="April 11, 2016  3:15PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2016 3:40PM by James_Stuart.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, <a href="/forums/profile/catty_big">@catty_big</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">@ghostwhistler</a>, I don't know why you think the interesting direction for this thread is "let's examine the Pundit and see whether he's a cool dude or not", but I will be the person to assert it's not interesting.<br/><br/>Please move on.

In the case of true misogynists, I'm happy to simply kick them out.  If you converted someone from sexism via a gaming club, then I regard you as a full-fledged miracle worker.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, there are definitely some gamers who aren't fundamentally sexist but are prone to dumb shit coming out of their mouths at times, and that I can absolutely work with.  Sometimes a raised eyebrow and a "Dude, <i>really?!"</i> is all it takes.  We all have bad habits that can clash with who we want to be, and in those cases being told "not here!" can go down super smooth.<br/><br/>None of us can see into anyone's soul, so I guess it might be hard to tell the difference.  The reason I have to guess, though, is because my experience (with overwhelmingly decent gamers) says otherwise.  On the one hand, I've met many people who are obviously <i>not</i> bigots but sometimes need to be more conscious of their audience.  And then on the other hand there was that guy who harassed the women and grated on the men and hijacked the games and basically kind of radiated "bad guy".

If you can make demands of people to act civilized, and they decide to respect your demands because they want to continue in the social setting, then it doesn't really matter whether they're harboring some secret hate or not. The standard in making demands of how people act in public and towards other people should not be about what they think, but about proper behavior. It would be impossible to somehow distinguish between people who are being momentarily foolish and people who have sinstains on the soul and should therefore be eternally barred from civil society.<br/><br/>In other words, the practical hard line is not "is this person really a misogynist?", but rather "is this person willing to act civil for the sake of getting along with others?" Those who care more about their bigotry than their gaming should evidently be dismissed, while among the rest it really doesn't matter at all for any practical purpose whether they're just thoughtless or committed to hate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452143/#Comment_452143" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-11T19:47:28+00:00" title="April 11, 2016  7:47PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yes, do your best on enforcement!  My point was that, even if your enforcement options are limited, don't let that stop you from adopting and communicating a policy, because sometimes a little goes a long way.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'm speaking from experience at small events, where a policy is announced aloud to all attendees, who see everyone at the con receiving the message.  I'm pretty sure this has gotten many attendees on board with the proper expectations, such that no further enforcement was needed.  <br/><br/>I am not claiming things will always go so smoothly, I'm just saying that sometimes simply making the point loudly enough can do a lot.  ("Loud" is key -- I figure sticking a note in the middle of a large event pamphlet would be less effective.)</blockquote>\nYup, announcing out loud and making clear that it applies to all attendees + staff/volunteers is key. Also important re: some of the other comments above is making clear to your community that enforcing the policy is not about determining who is right or wrong, or who is telling the truth, or judging guilt, or determining who is a "true" bigot and who is "just joking" or anything like that: it's about immediately and effectively addressing the concerns of people who feel unsafe. Everything else is secondary.

Persuading someone to do something they already sort of want to do is way easier than persuading someone to do something that means nothing to them or makes no sense to them.  "I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but I've soaked up some sexist cliches" is obviously the former, while "I have no regard for women" is obviously the latter.  Even someone who intends to behave for the sake of acceptance is going to find it difficult to pantomime some routine of respect if they don't actually harbor it.  <br/><br/>Again, that's in my experience.

I don't think loving the sinner does any good without hating the sin, though.  Accepting losers and pushing them to be better seems way more noble to me than accepting losers and letting all their antisocial tendencies fester.<br/><br/>There's a guy in my frisbee pick-up group who liked to rant against feminism while we played.  I kinda thought he was joking, but it was clearly a distraction for some of the people on the field who felt passionately about the issue and felt like someone was picking a fight with their beliefs.  So, as someone who's been playing this game for a while, I told him to knock it off and stop distracting from play.  Combined with grumblings from plenty of other players, that did the trick.  He's a contrarian who didn't think he was in the wrong, but he <i>was</i> clear on why the group assembles: <i>to play frisbee</i>.  If you're ruining others' ability to do that, then that's the end of the story -- you <i>cannot</i> be allowed to continue.  So he stopped the ranting.<br/><br/>So, Eero, it seems to me that if your gaming group met explicitly <i>to play D&amp;D</i>, rather than as a hybrid between that and some sort of "this hobby is for losers" expectation-fulfillment charity, it would be literally impossible for a years-long pattern of disruptive play to emerge.  I understand passivity and conflict-avoidance, but if you can't play then you can't play, and no one who's there just to play is going to suffer that in complete silence.  Even if I'd never said a word to the loudmouth on the field, more and more people were seeing him as a distraction, and <i>everyone</i> who felt that way began to grumble about it.  That's happened before, and no player who's had their every move grumbled about has persisted for long.  They've all either shaped up or shipped out.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that I don't think there's a place in the world for events where hanging out is primary and the stated activity, e.g. an RPG, is secondary.  But "inclusively just hanging out" seems pretty radical to me, like no one should opt in unless they're ready to handle anything and everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452148/#Comment_452148" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-11T23:22:14+00:00" title="April 11, 2016 11:22PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2016 11:24PM by catty_big.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think seeing him as the heart of criticism of the article is probably countered by just searching more widely on the internet, but that's beside the point.</blockquote>\nThank you for resiling from the rather more insulting way you originally phrased that comment, although you're still suggesting that I'm not aware of the wider scope of this issue, which, given our large number of mutuals on G+, is not only insulting but also absurd. And you still miss the point, which is that The Pundit and various of his sidekicks at The RPGSite and elsewhere are a large part of the problem, and therefore worthy of mention in this thread. Of course they're not the only ones, hence my expression 'maelstrom of voices'. \n<blockquote>You have plenty of other venues if you want to express criticism of the Pundit or the sites he runs. Don't take a pretty reasonable discussion of how harassment can happen in gaming and push it to internet forum vs forum junk.</blockquote>\nAgain you seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that I'm somehow using this thread to launch personal attacks on people I don't like, in this case The RPG Pundit. You have only to look at my earlier post - which ironically ghostwhistler quoted in support of his own, similar, opinion - to see that "discussion  of how harassment can happen in gaming" was precisely what both ghostwhistler and I were engaged in doing. <br/><br/>But I suspect that at the heart of this lies your concern that the mere mention of The Pundit is likely in itself to trigger a flame war - a perfectly understandable position, he's a hugely controversial and divisive figure, the mentioning of whom has indeed provoked flame wars on various forums. However, if you intend that to be a matter for moderation, please make this explicit so that everyone knows where they stand. <br/><br/>I will now 'move on', but before I do so I would request that in future you examine more closely a forum user's overall contribution to a thread before you moderate one of their comments in it.

We've got far too much zen for that. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>. To answer your question - although I think you and Eero got there - I think the majority of sexist behaviour is seen in maladjusted young men who are being hurtful out of thoughtlessness rather than hardcore misogynist beliefs. <br/><br/>I worked for a while in schools with kids with Special Educational Needs and a large part of helping them feel less alienated and curbing anti-social behaviour was through a process of "socialising" - making safe social spaces where collaboration, sharing and communication were practiced in a way that couldn't really be achieved in the classroom. We'd play games and the kids would learn to get on, respect each other's contributions and generally gain more experience with social norms. Basic stuff, like thinking about what your words will do before you say them. <br/><br/>In a way adult gaming clubs can act a lot like this. Socialising young men out of their alienated behaviours; behaviours that can be fed by the internet and a self-selecting misogynist online culture. Just by being there and showing that you are an adult male who doesn't think sexism is cool can have a big impact. <br/><br/>Of course, if people are really intent on letting sexism and hate be their identity, then perhaps the more subtle nudging of social disapproval isn't going to shift that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452159/#Comment_452159" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-12T10:39:02+00:00" title="April 12, 2016 10:39AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            the only reason I mentioned therpgsite was to point out exactly the sort of experience the article talks about.
