I got this from... some anime or other, I think? Anyway, imagine that for a long(ish?) campaign game that every session or two you would introduce the PC's city of operation. Say, for example it was a fantasy world which you plan to later have destroyed or overrun:<br/><br/>Every episode you describe the three same places. Like, a public fountain, the bustling marketplace, the courtyard to the palace.<br/><br/>Each session, some little scene happens which you (the GM) lay out in a few seconds in detail: At the fountain there's always a pigtail red-dress girl running around with friends, reading a book, etc. At the marketplace there's a family running a bakery with a new baby, an old patron who swings by every day for food and a quick conversation. The courtyard is where the young knight is learning some combat moves from the senior instructor.<br/><br/>Then some big event happens (in the game I was thinking of - an L5R game from a year or two ago): The city is destroyed or overrun. You describe the same scenes as before, but now there's no people, buildings are shattered, fragments scattered all over the place, the absence of people totally felt. <br/><br/>Maybe if the city had better days before the fall, we would see the girl have more friends, another child raised by the market family (or more employees of their successful family business), the young knight in turn instructing the next wave of young recruits, etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, in a campaign with a huge change like this, I was thinking that if you were to consciously set up a recurring set of scenes like this each session, when the city finally changes, falls, etc the impact would probably be more noticeable to the players. You'd have to have a clear idea of what might happen way down the line to set up something like this, but it would probably make a pretty big impact.<br/><br/>Just a small idea I thought of.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295441/#Comment_295441" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T18:58:24+00:00" title="September 30, 2010  6:58PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ... and suddenly the Hyrule Market theme is stuck in my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295443/#Comment_295443" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T19:13:05+00:00" title="September 30, 2010  7:13PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Watchmen, the comic at least (haven't seen the movie) did this pretty well, too.

In classical music, composers used a form called 'theme and variation' to mess with the listener. You can use the same motive/plot device (e.g., a city) to relate different ideas at different times, simply by changing one little aspect (like the absence of people). I like this a lot.<br/><br/>Doesn't most of the horror genre hinge on this technique? ("Everything's normal, yada yada... bam! Blood and murder and demons!")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295507/#Comment_295507" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T08:11:52+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  8:11AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!<br/><br/>I use repetition in my long-running games. It's important for Hero's Journey stuff, for one.
