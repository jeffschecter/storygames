I noted that the fence was not a character in conflict with the man but rather a modifier on his conflict with the woman.  There are, however, some cases where a character can be in conflict with an inanimate object.<br/><br/>The key to identifying when this is appropriate is to determine if it\u2019s possible to view the object as if it were willfully acting on some kind of agenda.  Consider the scene in a lot of movies where a character is trapped in a malfunctioning elevator.  Ever notice how the elevator behaves as if it were intelligent and doing everything to pro-actively thwart the character\u2019s attempts at escape?  That\u2019s how you do conflict with an inanimate object.<br/><br/>In Sorcerer the GM just assigns the object some dice.  There\u2019s a chart in the book guiding how many dice should be assigned but Ron has admitted to defaulting to three.  Then you just run the conflict as normal with the GM announcing \u201cactions\u201d for the object.  These can even be physical attacks like, \u201cThe cable snaps and whips violently at you.\u201d<br/><br/>Much simpler situations can sometimes warrant such things.  Consider the example of a gun sliding around on the roof a train.  The player could just roll Stamina for the purposes of ordering his attempt to grab the gun relative to the other action in the scene and when he\u2019s turn comes up he just grabs the gun.  But man, doesn\u2019t it seem sometimes like that gun is *purposefully* crawling away out of reach?  Hmmm\u2026. Grab some dice.<br/><br/>If a player is attempting to do something to an inanimate object and the object can be treated as if it had an agenda that opposes the player then it\u2019s a conflict and you should roll like any other conflict.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133107/#Comment_133107" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T22:00:10+00:00" title="March  6, 2008 10:00PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am linking all these threads together, not to "close" them to other questions, but to help people read them in order.
