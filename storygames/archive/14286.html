If you look at a <a href="http://www.bouken.jp/pd/sg/pdf/sg_sc_hasuba.pdf" rel="nofollow">character sheet</a> from Shinobigami (their modern ninja action game), you'll see a big 6x11 grid in the middle. Each column is a category of ninja stuff, like magic, warfare, weapons, etc., which contain a bunch of stuff like Fire Magic, Shuriken, Climbing, etc. Each character is trained in 5 of these. When the time comes to make a roll, you figure out what skill is the most applicable. If you're trained in that one, you roll 2d6 and try to get a 5 or better. If you're not, you count the number of steps (no diagonals, but you can wrap around) on the grid and add that to the target number.<br/><br/>Shinobigami's ninja skills are fairly straightforward (hey, Medicine and Poison are right next to each other), but the other Sai-Fi games get into more creative territory. In <a href="http://www.bouken.jp/pd/mg/index.html" rel="nofollow">Magicalogia</a> (a game about wizards dealing with out of control grimoires), the skills are about magic, and the categories are Star, Beast, Power, Song, Dream, and Darkness. In <a href="http://www.bouken.jp/pd/pkb/index.html" rel="nofollow">Peekaboo</a> (a game about ghost stories with elementary school kids) the categories are Delinquent, Athletics, Friendship, Play, Study, and Adult.<br/><br/>The other day Matt tweeted:\n<blockquote>New brainstorm: use the Saikoro Fiction rules to create a David Bowie Rpg. Each category represents an era: ziggy, thin white duke, etc</blockquote>\nWhich is pretty amazing. So, how would you use the Sai-Fi skill grid?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324459/#Comment_324459" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T12:29:28+00:00" title="May 14, 2011 12:29PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is sort of along the lines of a design I've been working on, using a graphical representation of skills which branch out to more and more specific niches.

I was able to do this quickly only because I left a bunch of gaps.<br/>- The early editions of Shadowrun had a skill web system where you just drew lines between related skills and took penalties to move between them. This seems like a good alternative option to keep unrelated skills away from each other and would be easier to hack together quickly.<br/>- AW-style resolution seems to work fine with this.<br/><br/>(Edit: wrong link)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324532/#Comment_324532" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T22:32:49+00:00" title="May 14, 2011 10:32PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was developing a skill matrix like this over 2 years ago when I was working on my Quincunx game concept.<br/><br/>6 elements x 6 ability categories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324557/#Comment_324557" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T06:29:23+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  6:29AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt; Why always 6 x 11?<br/><br/>I'm not sure why it's *always* like that. In Shinobigami and I think a lot of the others the six columns come from each of the six ninja factions specializing in one area (and whichever one your character belongs to, three of your trained skills have to be from there). The columns are numbered 2 to 12, suggesting that you're meant to roll 2d6 to get one at random sometimes, but I'm not sure how that plays into the game.<br/><br/>&gt; What links a row together? A category?<br/><br/>A category or theme of some kind. They range from very concrete ("Weapons") to purely thematic ("Dream"). (Also, combat damage knocks out your ability to use a given column, hence the check boxes above each one).<br/><br/>&gt; How does advancement work?<br/><br/>In Shinobigami at least, advancement is along other vectors. You advance your ninja rank, which gives you access to more Ninpo (ninja special techniques) and Ougi (super techniques). Your actual skills stay the same, though there are some Ninpo that affect skill use.<br/><br/>&gt; A table in English would be awesome.<br/><br/>I'll see about that when I have time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324559/#Comment_324559" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T06:38:15+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  6:38AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent, thanks!

The Saikoro Fiction system is really interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find a translated character sheet here: http://d66roc.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/shinobigami-character-sheet/<br/>\n<br/>\nThough Ewen and Andy both pretty much answered everything, I have a few thoughts in regards to some of the comments in here:<br/>\n-Characters in Japanese RPGs pretty much start off pretty much "complete," as in, no need to level up before they're viable (like in DnD).  Leveling up in most Saikoro Fiction games will NEVER give you another skill; all characters only have 5 (though some Sai-Fi games have special rules for a 6th).<br/>\n-Every character will always have a specialized category from which they must choose 2 or 3 skills.  The "gap" on either side of the category is filled in, making the categories to the side easier to use.<br/>\n-I get the feeling that the placement of each skill is somewhat random.  Having ESP next to Finance, using the Shinobigami grid as an example, doesn't make a lot of narrative sense, but can lead to some interesting gaming.  This encourages players to spread their skills out across the grid and can encourage gaming the system in a way.  The game Hunter's Moon (the 3rd game in the Sai-Fi series) is very... gamey?  Not much narraitivism, as opposed to Shinobigami and Magikalogia.<br/>\n-Usually, the far right column and far left columns are NOT connected, unless the character takes a specific ability that allows them to do so.  Usually that ability is restricted to certain "classes."  For example, in Shinobigami, the only way to connect the Tool column to the Supernatural column is a skill called Hadesology: basically it's using technology to reproduce Supernatural phenomenon.
