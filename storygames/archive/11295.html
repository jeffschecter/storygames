My social studies teacher ran a "model constitutional convention" scenario that had been assembled primarily to show the difficulties faced by small states vs. big states and slave states vs. free states in the 7th grade. It was pretty awesome, I was Benjamin Franklin.<br/><br/>Model UN had a number of goals and they were fairly modest.  The most important thing to remember about the goal was that it was not <i>simulation</i> but <i>education</i>.  That is, if it was more educational for the kids to do something that wasn't strictly how the Model UN or their countries would act, we had them do it.<br/><br/>It was educational about a number of things, not all of them having to do with the UN.<br/><br/>For example, this was one of the first times that high school students would have to deal with procedural rules of order.  The Model UN procedural rules were simplified versions of the real procedural rules, and manipulating them and working out what to do next with them was pretty cool even separated from any "UN content".<br/><br/>The next area of education was that each delegation was supposed to educate themselves on their nation's position on a particular topic.  For example, the Social and Humanitarian Committee (SOCHUM) addressed the rights of women in a particular session that I ran.  It was important for the kids representing regressive regimes to be able to state and justify their nation's preferences on the rights of women, or the lack thereof.  To answer David's (tongue in cheek?) question from the other thread about whether (for example) the US delegation intentionally sided with multinational corporations, bigwigs and power brokers over workers and the powerless, the answer is "sort of".  The delegations had to be able to justify and explain their positions to each other, and know where they could "give" and where they couldn't. If you asked the kids "hey, are you accurately portraying the US' imperialistic tendencies", we would hope that they would reply as the actual US delegation might by saying "Of course not, our positions are based on financial needs, our leadership position in the western world and the principles of freedom and private property" or whatever.  We weren't teaching ethics, philosophy or anything like that, we were teaching argument and research.<br/><br/>Now naturally as many people pointed out, there's a big instinct to "go beyond" the topic in order to do other things.  For example, the representatives of the repressive regimes up above could have been awfully bored as the more progressive ones pushed forward without them, picking off wavering folks as the truly hidebound ones "accurately" portrayed themselves as marginalized in the debate.  So often times they would make offers to other countries on other, non-focused topics, that could be used to obtain their support (or undermine their support for antagonistic proposals).  We didn't really "regulate" those in the sense that we kinda wanted the kids to push beyond the topic we provided them in their research.  <br/><br/>More importantly, this was also educating them on what politics is like - trading support here and there, what real deal-breakers are and aren't, maintaining your ability to compromise and work together, etc.<br/><br/>(Nobody ever lectured the kids on what the real UN would and wouldn't pass, if the kids rammed through a resolution about universal suffrage and the right of Israel to exist, fine with us, remember, the simulation always, always took a back seat to education.)<br/><br/>Each of the committees had two major topics that the kids had to work on.  Before the main convention, we would select the proposal of one of the delegations as being the "starting proposal" for the committee to deal with.  That was both an honor and a responsibility because they had to procedurally introduce the proposal properly and advocate for it first out of the committee, getting the ball of debate rolling.  <br/><br/>The Security Council not only had 2 topics, but we also introduced a "crisis" which would have to be dealt with over the 2 days of the convention.<br/><br/>The International Court of Justice heard one major and one minor case.<br/><br/>It was all completely awesome, ask me one million questions about Model UN or list your own experiences here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250859/#Comment_250859" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T13:10:22+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  1:10PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stoopid Security Council Crises!!!<br/><br/>My first time out, I was part of the Libyan delegation and the crisis involved us announcing we'd joined the Nuclear Club.

We referred to them as "delegates" and "representatives", and that's pretty much the extent of the role. We weren't teaching national personality or customs or anything, although some did learn things like formal hellos, goodbyes, bows and handshakes and stuff.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>* Who was the final arbiter of "canonical play?" How was non-canonical play corrected, and how did the group handle "ret-conning" anything non-canonical that was said or done, to get back on track?</blockquote>\nI don't know what you mean here. In other words, if a kid gets way off track of what his nation really believes, did someone correct them?  That was done in the preparation phase, in which the kids were required to write and edit position statements with the assistance of the teachers/club leaders/other kids at their schools.  If they decided to stand up and make a silly speech, nobody stopped them doing that, nobody corrected them from doing that.  An adult (i.e. college student) ran the committee meetings and made sure everyone followed the procedural rules, but I can't remember any in-the-moment content checks. There were no "retcons" that I can remember.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Were there any specific nation's delegate(s) that the class had trouble portraying, for reasons of either significant cultural differences or being unsympathetic to that nation's general ideology (or both)?</blockquote>\nIn the 7 years I participated, the hardest for people to portray weren't the villains, it was the ones that didn't have a dog in the fight.  When talking about women's rights, for example, it was easy to be the US or UK, it was easy to be Iran or Syria, but Poland? They had to research the hell out of the position of lukewarm nations to figure out what they could or couldn't "give" on.  This was offset slightly by the fact that everyone had to court the lukewarm nations in order to develop a majority.

But this really drove home their institutional role as representatives/delegates.  They were unhappy that they couldn't promise/threaten certain things that they wanted to.  But we also tried to give them instructions that gave them broad discretion to settle affairs.<br/><br/>Edit: I remember one year that we had a Pakistani/India skirmish that was heating up. One of the issues we gave the Pakistani delegation was "civilian evacuation of a potential battleground" and let them spring it on the India delegation unawares. When they got their next set of instructions, the India delegation was relieved that they'd been given discretion to handle that as they saw fit.  Although the war was getting ready, the two sides could wrangle out (with the assistance of allies) an agreement by which thousands of civilians could be saved.

We coordinated with the university library to have some staff on hand to help the kids research their nation's positions on the crisis (I think it was the Pakistan/India thing), so that when we - surprise! - sprang it on them on the first day of the convention, they could rush over to the university library and have something intelligent and researched to say about it on the second day. The librarians were GREAT and loved helping out the kids formulate their summaries and policies, and the teachers said the kids were buzzing with excitement all the way home.  Pretty much the "oh my god, RUN TO THE LIBRARY" thing worked perfectly. I don't know if we ever replicated that success again, it just so happened that we had some great people with library contacts that year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
