This is ironic because they're trying to sell you a new RPG system, but what they mean is don't get bogged down in how much damage weapons do in this ruleset do vs. that ruleset: the thing we want you to get excited about is the art and the fiction and the setting and concepts that occupy more space in this rulebook than, you know, rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The Forge adopts "system does matter" as a manifesto for game design in which the rules are tightly written to produce specific play experiences with the overt expectation that players will have a better time the more closely they follow the rules, as a reaction to contemporary predecessors like Rifts (or perhaps Vampire, I don't have the experience to say) where the covert expectation is that you'll have a better time the more you pick and choose from this big smorgasbord of loosely-written rules and mechanics and one-man's-treasure which would make you hork if you tried to swallow it all indiscriminately.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Further discussion at the Forge leads to an expanded definition of system as all those things that individual groups use to decide what does and doesn't happen in the imagined space, which vary between groups even when they're both trying their best to follow the same set of rules faithfully. This is ironic because it represents kind of a return to the original White Wolf position: we agree that things should be this way regardless of rules because that's what feels right based on the pictures of vampires and the canon of fan mythos and the fact that we're in a group that's playing this game and not another one because something in the way it was presented and marketed appealed to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are my questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Is this factually true? A little Googling of "system doesn't matter" +white wolf didn't turn up much that looked like an official endorsement, and re-reading Ron's original article I saw that he talks not about this idea having come from Vampire but rather having been around for 20 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n- True or not, is this analysis "dreadfully jejune" (as Chip Delany once remarked on one of my essay-question exams when he was teaching undergrads at UMass Amherst)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309112/#Comment_309112" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T11:24:07+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 11:24AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take - there are two orthogonal sets of concerns that are usually muddled together when these sorts of conversations about "system" come up. One is "story-oriented play vs. PC-oriented play," while the other is "more complicated rules vs. more spontaneity." White Wolf's fans tend to favor character-oriented, spontaneous gameplay, whereas Forge types tend to favor rules-heavy, story-oriented play. What neither group favors is PC-oriented, rules-heavy gameplay, but thanks to D&amp;D, this is the model of gaming that about 90% of the RPG community tends to take for granted.<br><br>And just FYI, when I saw Delany give a talk in Toronto some years back, he tried to argue that <i>Moby Dick</i> isn't about a whale at all, but instead, is really about about "every other novel ever written." He also wore a leather belt that was covered with shiny metal studs. Hard to imagine how anything on your essay could have been <i>that</i> jejune.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309114/#Comment_309114" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T11:40:49+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 11:40AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2011 11:43AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>White Wolf pushes the motto that "system doesn't matter" - either through the marketing for Vampire et al. or through public comments by their designers</blockquote>\nNo they didn't.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>The Forge adopts "system does matter" as a manifesto for game design in which the rules are tightly written to produce specific play experiences with the overt expectation that players will have a better time the more closely they follow the rules.</blockquote>\nNo, it didn't.<br><br>The main point of the System Matters essay (and thankfully the only one that has survived) was that <i>aesthetic preferences</i> could be fulfilled or not fulfilled by a system on many, many levels, from handling time to character effectiveness, from preferring a particular sort of die type to a particular outcome.

All the games I played with WW fans were heavily pre-scripted and story-oriented (which is supported by the official metaplots and campaigns). All my experiences with "forge" games were rules mid-to-light and very character focused.<br><br>I'm not sure what the exact distinction between PC and character is here, but the "rules heaviness" of D&amp;D varies a lot from edition to edition. D&amp;D is a hard-to-define chimera.<br><br>So, I dunno. I'm not trying to disagree, just my experience.<br/><br/>Back to Tavis: Imo Jason is right. "System doesn't matter" was never anyone's stated agenda or design ideal or whatever. It doesn't exist as such. <br/>"System matters" was a reactionary move to certain games and design patterns, yes, but those were emergent, observed properties, not part of some clearly declared manifesto.<br/><br/><br/>--<br/>Marginalia/Related anecdote/PS: <br/>I'm was having lunch with a friend of mine just a few days ago. He has played a lot of D&amp;D, and he has been recently running a little WHFRP. He has almost no experience of any other systems, and isn't into any kind of "theory". So... he tried running Mage a few weeks back for a couple of friends, his first time with the game. He loved the setting, the ideas behind it, the magic system. But then he started talking about dice rolls. I'm going to quote him more or less verbatim:<br/>"We only rolled dice four or five times during two sessions. Both times I didn't know when to ask for a roll or what it meant. It seemed like rolling dice was pointless, like it didn't matter. Most of the time I just said yes to whatever they were trying to do, I felt bad asking them to roll the dice. Once or twice, when they failed, they just rolled their thumbs a bit and looked around and then asked if they could try again."<br/>I had different but similar experience with running and playing WoD games for the first time ten years ago. The mechanics were apparently not satisfying or fulfilling in any significant way. Sessions often felt hollow.<br/><br/>In this aspect I think it can be seen how Storyteller system can very much seem "not to matter". But as Jason said, there were other parts to the White Wolf System which pushed its own aesthetic goals. I don't think WW is saying "sytem doesn't matter" it's just that its techniques and ephemera seem divorced from the elements of the exploration to me. And the techniques and ephemera prescribed by the game text is usually what ends up being a given group's system. So subsequently you have strong seeds of setting, situation, colour, probably even character but system seems all just "Eh, whatever.".                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309122/#Comment_309122" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T12:53:03+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 12:53PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to think that 'system doesn't matter' was a zeitgeist thing, because I had very little to do with White Wolf and I still came across it (hell, I thought it many a time).<br/><br/>My take is that it grew out of the fact that all 'trad' systems address basically the same concerns. Chrgen, combat, skills, magic/tech, foes. They did them with their own philosophies and styles, but ultimately RQ and GURPS would do 99% of the same stuff.<br/><br/>You could either zealously maintain the superiority of a particular system (RQ fanboy here) or see this as nonsense. But in my circles it led to a definite feeling that 'roleplaying' was a thing that existed outside any particular ruleset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309123/#Comment_309123" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T12:53:46+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 12:53PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>I don't recall having ever seen exactly this phrase, but the nWoD books (especially supplements like<i>Midnight Roads</i>,<i>Ghost Stories</i>, etc., that aren't for a specific game within the product line) are full of advice about when and how much to use the rules, and when to ignore them for the sake of keeping the game flowing.</blockquote>\nThat's not the same as "system doesn't matter" under the normal meaning of the phrase, or even the meaning in the System Matters essay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309124/#Comment_309124" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T12:55:57+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 12:55PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2011 12:56PM by Tulpa.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>White Wolf pushes the motto that "system doesn't matter" - either through the marketing for Vampire et al. or through public comments by their designers</blockquote>\nNo they didn't.<br/><br/>Sure they do.

Which is related to the way in which many RPGs give explicit advice to GMs to ignore rules or fudge dice rolls, thereby elevating the GM to a point where fun or not fun depends on them.  That is, if the game wasn't fun, it's because the GM didn't ignore rules enough and let them get in the way.<br/><br/>The reason I don't like that is that I was the main GM for my group of friends for 10 years, three to five days a week, and this responsibility wore me out.  I don't want it.

Dude even says, "The rules are only guidelines."  This sentiment gets repeated several more times in the text, so they really wanted people to notice it.  (Feel free to hate me for having a 2e DMG handy.  I'm getting an early start on spring cleaning and moving some boxes around.)<br/><br/>So, given that AD&amp;D dominated the marketplace and nearly everyone who owned dice played it at least a few times, why did White Wolf somehow end up as the Evil Rule Zero Boogeyman, and not TSR?  Was it just that AD&amp;D2e was so frickin' awful that everyone agreed it needed all the rule-zero help it could possibly get, or was it because that crazy little dot in Mark Rein-Hagen's name annoyed everyone so much?  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309133/#Comment_309133" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T14:21:15+00:00" title="January 22, 2011  2:21PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2011 2:23PM by J_Walton.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "System does matter" was only kinda linked to White Wolf, like John said.  In my mind, it was more about the attitude that resulted from a lot of design work in the late 1980s and early 1990s being more or less the same.  Like, circa 1998, it seemed like every system you encountered was:<br/><br/>-- "Splats" or character classes based on ethnicity or philosophical orientation<br/>-- Attributes<br/>-- Skills<br/>-- Magic or powers<br/>-- Character Quirks of some kind<br/>-- Some morality system<br/>-- Some form of resource points that you could spend to be awesome ("hero points" etc.)<br/>-- Mechanics that supposedly covered everything but mostly revolved around 50 pages of combat rules<br/>-- Described themselves as "make-believe for adults" or "storytelling" games (despite the huge combat focus)<br/>-- Hundreds of pages of setting that wasn't really set up to be directly implemented in actual play<br/>-- Terrible, super-railroaded adventure writing<br/>-- Assumed endless campaigns that would go on for years<br/>-- Etc.<br/><br/>And, because most roleplaying systems were very similar, written for the same set of "general purpose" GMing and player techniques, often with the same assumptions about what the content of play would consist of, people started feeling like it didn't really matter what game you were playing.  Everything was essentially interchangable.  Why bother learning a new system?  Why bother DESIGNING a new system, if it was just going to be a slight hack of the status quo?<br/><br/>Really, the games that really started to raise questions about these assumptions were ones like My Life With Master, Primetime Adventures, and the like. Games that looked REALLY different from those mid-1990s assumptions about what roleplaying was about.<br/><br/>To be fair, actually, White Wolf's design work, while having a lot of these traits, was really more different and original than a lot of the other stuff that was being produced at the time.  Yeah, they had Rule Zero and they used more or less the same rules system for all of their games, but they recognized that their various lines weren't really mechanically compatible with each other (like, playing Mages and Vampires together never really worked).  And some of their later lines (Wraith, Orpheus, Promethean, etc.) did a bunch of experimental stuff that was very cool for a "mainstream" (ha!) game company.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309135/#Comment_309135" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T14:38:55+00:00" title="January 22, 2011  2:38PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2011 2:44PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't recognize that description of late-90s games. 1998, your exemplar year, contained (for example) Deadlands (no morality system, classes based on occupation), The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen (nothing on your list matches Baron Munchausen), the two SAGA games based on Dragonlance and Marvel (which used a card-based character building system), QAGS, Star Trek: TNG, Dark Conspiracy (both of which used lifepaths instead of splats), and so forth.<br/><br/>In fact, I don't remember any other morality systems being too significant in the mid-90s other than in White Wolf games?

The "ignore the roll" advice is in an earlier section of the game, "Breaking the Rules" p. 60-61, not under the Golden Rule header.

The Chronicle needed to be beautiful and tragic.  It needed to make angels weep and devils reconsider.  I remember feeling that pressure when I ran it, and so whenever players threatened my narrative, I would be scared.  In fact, I liked to run Vampire one-on-one to minimize the players' disruptive influence.<br/><br/>De-emphasizing rules, making them impressionistic and contradictory and broken and then relegating them to an advisory role anyway, was another useful method of player neutralization.  As Robin's Laws of Good Game Mastering had it:\n<blockquote>Rules sets in which crunchy hits predominate give power to the players...Rules systems that limit the impact of crunchy bits give power to the GM.</blockquote>\nAnd of course some players who didn't want to be neutralized got neutralized<sup>1</sup>, and so we have the Forge and Fuck Rule Zero and so on.<br/><br/>AD&amp;D2E, on the other hand, brought no such pressure.  None of the main rules texts really got into how a campaign is supposed to appear or feel.  In fact, the word "campaign" isn't even in the index of my copy of the DMG!  Is the campaign it a urban sandbox or a dungeon railroad?  Is it an arena of endless monsters?  Is it happy, funny, beautiful, tragic?  Is it PVP?  AD&amp;D2E didn't say, and (subjectively) it didn't add a lot of value to any of these approaches anyway.<br/><br/>TSR might have had the sales, but White Wolf, with their tighter focus and cocksure attitude, had the mindshare.  I remember being <i>so pumped</i> when GURPS Vampire came out because I wanted the cool gnarliness of White Wolf to be ported to my grown-up respectable game system.<br/><br/>Maybe Microsoft / Apple is a useful analogy?

White Wolf, for all its sales and growth back then, was still a teeny tiny chihuahua next to the ginormous dire wolf that was D&amp;D, right?  If it was market share that mattered, then TSR would be the first and only name anyone would ever bother mentioning.<br/><br/>But yeah, White Wolf <i>grew</i> during that time, and was visibly more successful than the other little game studios around them, so if it's growth that matters, then that makes more sense.  Everyone pays more attention to motion and change, and so a tiny company becoming less tiny will seem more significant than a big company staying big.<br/><br/>Putting this together with johnzo's observations above, I'm wondering if this weird perception thing that White Wolf stepped into really <i>is</i> the pretentious little dot in Rein-Hagen's name, at least symbolically.  Where TSR and FASA and Steve Jackson Games and lots of other publishers took a professional, "We're just here to sell gaming books to you, our fellow nerds" stance more often than not, White Wolf was always waving its arms around playing the gaming evangelist and flying a more pretentious-looking flag, and while everyone loves an underdog, no one really likes an evangelist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309177/#Comment_309177" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T21:35:57+00:00" title="January 22, 2011  9:35PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good questions, Matt.<br/>What I meant was:<br/>1- Why would I ever want to fudge dice rolls?<br/>2- Maybe I'd want to because the game system seems to consistently produce thematically erroneous outcomes. If the dice seem to interfere with what we've got going on as a play-group, we might blame the system, and want to work around it.<br/>3- Assuming 2 is not the case in one's subjective experience of a game, what are some other reasons that come to mind to fudge dice rolls?<br/><br/>Does that help?<br/><br/>Oh, and "thematically erroneous" is distinct from "what a twist!" It's more like "Oh. That's weird and annoying." As in, say, a system using Humanity Points wherein it's possible to lose all your Humanity Points on a single roll of only moderate significance, suddenly becoming an NPC. <br/>Let's say I design a system in which you consult a chart every time you break one of the Ten Commandments, and the number associated with a commandment (we'll use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments#Division_according_to_different_religions" rel="nofollow">Roman Catholic numbers</a>, since I was raised Roman Catholic) is how many d10's you roll when you break said commandment. If you get a 5 or lower on a given die, it's a failure. If you roll all failures on all your Commandment Dice, you become, I dunno, an apostate, and renounce Yahweh. <br/>So! You go big, and worship another god besides Yahweh. Roll a d10 - rightly so, there's a 50% chance that you abandon your faith. Seems appropriate. <br/>But then you go out and steal from a guy, and roll 7d10. It's really, really unlikely that stealing would make you lose your faith altogether, ,but it could still happen. If it does, this system (very limited, and that's the point) could be kind of screwy. <br/><br/>So. Point being, we might find ourselves in a situation in which coveting my neighbor's ass (Commandment 10, in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> Judeo-Christian tradition) could cause me to renounce my Lord God. And the GM might say "Gee, that's kind of excessive. Maybe we fudge that one bad roll, but keep using the system itself?"<br/>In this instance, fudging was useful because, damn it, we're playing this hot new game, <i>Decalogue: Twilight of the Idols</i>, and we don't want John's character Obadiah to get bumped from play because he commented longingly on the strength and fine coat of his neighbor's ass. <br/><br/>Clearly, Decalogue could use some work. But if we can only secure a short-term commitment, it'd be easier for a given play group to just tweak and it keep going.

You called for a roll, and then suddenly knew that you had nothing, absolutely nothing, nothing even remotely interesting that you could do with the result that came up.  All you can see in that moment is the yawning chasm of your mistake, and all the negative consequences stemming from it that will kill your fun and everyone else's fun and derail the game and make this the worst game any of you have ever been part of.<br/><br/>So you think, the hell with that stupid little piece of plastic, there's no way that the random giant rat just critically hit and insta-killed the only PC who actually had a real reason to go after the bad guy.  There's no way that the murderer could have managed to clean up all the blood so well that even the World's Greatest Detective can't find any evidence.  There's no way that all thirty cops chasing the PCs will miss their driving rolls and end up in a giant smoking pile of Comically Bad Drivers at the bottom of the cliff.  There's something better, or at least something less stupid, that could happen instead, and if you were a smarter GM, you would have known that before you rolled the dice.<br/><br/>And maybe you're right about that.  Probably you're right about it most of the time, in fact:  people make mistakes every day, it's what we're best at.  What separates good dice fudging from bad dice fudging in my opinion is whether you learn something from the experience and don't make the same mistakes again.  If you're always fudging the dice to keep the PCs alive instead of figuring out why you're constantly throwing them into unwinnable fights, you're doing it wrong.  But if you're doing it once and then your immediate next reaction is thinking "Where did this go wrong, and how am I going to keep it from happening again?", good for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309191/#Comment_309191" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T02:28:50+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  2:28AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The toolkit approach Matt mentions is much more in line with White Wolf's modern approach than Rule Zero and fudging dice rolls, which I have to believe are an artifact of a system that grew too large for the line developers to manage. Books like <i>World of Darkness: Mirrors</i> introduce rules hacks which you can choose to apply or not apply to your table's system and details the specific ramifications of each approach. That book also contains my favorite piece of White Wolf text: Matt McFarland's guide to min/maxing your character for fun and profit in nWoD, and explanation of why it doesn't make you a bad person and is actually a pretty cool approach to gaming sometimes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309206/#Comment_309206" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T06:26:00+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  6:26AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, I think the 0.1% chance (2^10 is 1024, right?) of turning away from God because you coveted your neighbor's ass would make it pretty awesome if it actually came up!  That falls squarely in the category of "oh what a cool and unexpected twist."  I totally get what you mean about producing thematically erroneous outcomes.  But a truly well-designed game won't have that problem, for 2 reasons: 1) the basic math is correct.  2) You get a thematically appropriate outcome regardless of success or failure.  See PTA, Polaris, BW, AW, or any number of other games. (This is primarily a matter of conflict versus task resolution, BTW.

The put-upon director, M. Guilemette (Traits: Harried Producer, On The Cheap, Connection: The Widow Hudon), comes rushing in (M. Guilemette rushes everywhere) to the dressing room of famed Italian diva Signorina Ricci (Traits: I AM The Diva, Etiquette Applies To Everyone Else, Connections: My Sweet Admirer Andre) where she is being terrified by the floppy-necked spectre of an actor, Bernard, who was strangled by loansharks.<br/><br/>Excitedly, the director's player yells, "I order Bernard to desist, this is my production and I'll not have him torturing the diva. He can understudy for one of the minor parts." <br/><br/>The Producer says, swept along by the excitement, "If you lose, Bernard has free rein to poltergeist up the room!"<br/><br/>We start playing cards and chips and such and the Producer wins! Bernard poltergeists up the room and Ricci swoons, muttering about her contract.<br/><br/>.....meh. I guess that's a semi-okay scene, much as particular die rolls in particular other games lead to semi-okay results that don't really do much for the larger picture.  It's pretty crap though. It's like the director didn't do anything at all.<br/><br/>But if everyone had taken some time they might have realized one of two things:<br/><br/>1 - One of the outcomes (attaching the ghost to the production) was objectively better than the other <i>for everyone</i>, since it leads to future scenes and conflicts.  The Producer never should have started the conflict, he should have changed Bernard to really wanting a part.<br/><br/>2 - In the event the Producer does think a conflict would be a good idea, a much better result would be for Bernard to <i>possess</i> Signorina Ricci, which would give her a strong push into future scenes and conflicts, plus a scene where she has to be exorcised in her flimsy nightgown.<br/><br/>I'm shocked that anyone thinks conflict resolution makes men perfect, it does not. You can make a shitty mistake setting stakes just as you can anywhere else in your life?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309226/#Comment_309226" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T10:51:53+00:00" title="January 23, 2011 10:51AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Knowing nothing about the mechanics of PTA, it seems appropriate that the Producer should have said something like "If you lose, the poltergeist terrorizes everyone until you promise him the lead!"<br/>The stakes of conflict need need need to lead to other events that are interesting - when you win, demand more of the opposition or take things in a new direction.

For instance, in high-level D&amp;D you don't get instant kills. In high-level RQ you certainly do. GURPS I'm not sure about but it probably depends on options. Running high-level RQ is an exercise in on-the-spot judgement about when to fudge (IME), at least when you have hundreds of hours of investment in the chrs.<br/><br/>Cf. two games that are as old (and traditional?) as the above: Villains &amp; Vigilantes, in which it's almost impossible to die, and Pendragon, when the question is not <b>if</b> but <b>when</b> your chr will die. Why fudge in either case? <br/><br/>Again, you're playing RQ, and the only mechanics are combat mechanics (because everything else comes down to a single roll and a GM judgement), and if you want to avoid the possibility of sudden death, you must step away from those mechanics. And because there's no mechanical way of handling anything else, why, who needs rules? You get used to a certain way of handling everything except combat, which has a System.<br/><br/>To go back to Pendragon, if you want to step away from combat you find that there are indeed mechanics for other activities, many of which are merely rolls on tables, it's true, but provide structure and purpose for your chr. You can actually play a little mini-game or even solo game with these tables, and never have to touch combat. Even better, these activities <b>support</b> and <b>reinforce</b> the theme of the game, which is 'life in Arthurian times'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309237/#Comment_309237" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T14:06:15+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  2:06PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (In V&amp;V, of course, you will never face that moment of 'OMG I'm about to kill Kenny' and so you can throw unwinnable fights at the chrs all day.

That falls squarely in the category of "oh what a cool and unexpected twist."  I totally get what you mean about producing thematically erroneous outcomes.  But a truly well-designed game won't have that problem, for 2 reasons: 1) the basic math is correct.  2) You get a thematically appropriate outcome regardless of success or failure.  See PTA, Polaris, BW, AW, or any number of other games. (This is primarily a matter of conflict versus task resolution, BTW.  We might not buy it that my awesome Jedi is a punk who consistently can't even swing his lightsaber well, but we're much more likely to buy into the idea that despite his bad-asseosity, he just can't win every battle.)  <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is necessary because even in the present of condition 1, sometimes the dice are just really out of whack.  (Using a dice-pool rather than roll-and-add helps flatten out the probability curve a whole heck of a lot, of course.  White Wolf gets some credit here!)</blockquote>\nI don't think this varies that much with system, though advice varies.  All these systems depend on the group setting up the resolution so that all the resolution outcomes are appropriate - sticking to theme isn't usually a part of the mechanical results.  <br/><br/>For example, most resolution systems leave the question of <b>how</b> one fails up to the group, rather than being mechanically defined by the rules.  In Dogs in the Vineyard, I might fail in a Raise of shooting someone (i.e. be Blocked or Reverse the Blow).  That could be portrayed as me looking like a punk - or it could be that I look like a great shot and I failed for circumstances beyond my control.  The same is true in the Storyteller system or most other systems.  The character may fail a roll, but that could be portrayed as them looking stupid or it could be they did really well but it wasn't good enough for some reason.  <br/><br/>Many traditional games as well as Forge-inspired games tend to give advice like "Don't roll if the outcomed aren't appropriate."  I think the difference is that traditional games tend to put the burden of judging appropriate outcomes more on the GM, while games like Dogs in the Vineyard say that the group should negotiate conflicts that have appropriate outcomes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309256/#Comment_309256" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T20:15:09+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  8:15PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The Producer says, swept along by the excitement, "If you lose, Bernard has free rein to poltergeist up the room!"</blockquote>\nEhm...  there are no counter-stakes in PTA conflict resolution.<br/><br/>What happen in case of failure, is decided by the player (or the GM) who win narration.<br/><br/>Using counter-stakes is a sure way to devalue tension and imagination in conflicts.

He could win, and narrate a crap result, not intentionally, nobody would do that intentionally, but mistakenly, without thinking enough, without thinking it through, forgetting good advice, etc.  Have you heard people narrate crap results in PTA? Of course you have, at least once an episode or twice a session someone gives a complete dud.  <br/><br/>This is exactly, exactly, exactly, precisely the same as the Rule Zero-using player mistakenly tossing out a result when they should use it, or using a result when they shouldn't.  They have applied their aesthetic preferences to the scene and fucked it up, whoops.  Whether it's done with conflict or task resolution doesn't matter. We all must muddle through on this fallen earth, nobody and nothing made by the hand of man is perfect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309267/#Comment_309267" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T21:58:45+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  9:58PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that groups can mistake even how to set up stakes mechanically, such as setting counter-stakes.  However, I don't think that just enhances fallibility.  If they can't get the basic mechanics right, then they also may mess up the advice and have some stakes that give less interesting results.  Taking JD's example without the counter-stakes, it still could fall flat if the conflict is just over whether the ghost accepts the understudy role - i.e. the PC again fails, and the ghost refuses the offer.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Rule Zero is often praised as a way to "get the best story", but in that case, it's the idea of a "best story" inside the GM's head.  All you get is frustration when you see that your "best story" don't work in that moment at that table, and fall flat. So you use rule zero again to try to get the player interested, and fail again, and again, and again, and again...</blockquote>\nIt is certainly possible for a GM to use "Rule Zero" to push their own story, but it's not necessary.  A GM can use "Rule Zero" to say "yes" to the players, allowing them to incorporate things.  So, for example, rather than requiring a roll - a GM using Rule Zero in JD's example could say that the ghost accepts the offer.  That's a player story idea, and the GM could use Rule Zero to adopt it.  That is the explicit advice in a number of games, such as Champions.  \n<blockquote>As a GM, you'll find it all too easy to get caught up in <i>your</i> story, the great story you've got planned out, and to make sure you tell that story -- no matter how many improbable plot twists you have to throw in or player actions \\<br/>you have to ignore to make sure that your story takes place.  But <i>the player characters are the focus of your story</i>, and therefore they and their players are the most important elements in your story.  You should slant the story to suit them, not the other way around.  Learning how to do this, and do it well, is one of the hardest things about good GMing.</blockquote>\n...\n<blockquote>Similarly, when a player asks, "Is there a so-and-so nearby?", he usually has some neat idea in mind for using it, something you'll likely enjoy.  Unless it's impossible for that object to be in that area, tell him yes.  He'll feel like he's contributing to the story and the world, and you get to have fun seeing just what he has in mind.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309269/#Comment_309269" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T23:28:21+00:00" title="January 23, 2011 11:28PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An excellent point; like most things in gaming, whether something is sublime or terrible depends on the people involved.

I've never heard anyone argue that system in the "means by which we play" sense doesn't matter; it definitionally matters.  Instead, I've heard it argued that certain mechanics (especially resolution) don't matter.  Like Vampire's combat system.  See?  There's that word again.  "System."

In other words, the game is designed specifically to help you more consistently avoid the problem of Rule Zero, where a single player has most of the responsibility over correct rulings and outcomes. From a design and play perspective, Rule Zero judgments and PTA conflict resolution are total opposites.<br/><br/>Basically, your PTA example sucks.<br/><br/>(Hint: If you want to compare Rule Zero with the hot story game of the moment, JD, maybe consider Apocalypse World.

If they blow it, make a mistake with the use of their authority, the rest of the group can't fix it, they don't have the authority to (unless you Rule Zero PTA, of course.)<br/><br/>I am still shocked that people think PTA makes angels of men, surely you all can't be serious about this, that you have never, ever heard anyone say anything in a PTA game that was stupid and bad.

Running games of Fudge and OVA, the conclusion of game night would have me mentally exhausted to the point where I'd want to say, "Good game.

And much as I love Maid RPG, it's about the most exhausting RPG I've ever run.<br/><br/>So I've come to prefer stuff that's more collaborative or structured (or failing that, that plays faster) because it's genuinely better for my sanity, not because it inherently creates better experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309362/#Comment_309362" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T13:23:52+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  1:23PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2011 1:28PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Primetime Adventures, page 65-66:</b><br/>"<i>The entire group participates in the narration</i>, but one player has the authority to synthesize everyone's contributions and say for certain what it was that did or didn't happen."<br/><br/><br/>But whatever.

Why don't we ignore them? Because they challenge our creativity. It is often more difficult to narrate dramatically fun and dynamic results within the constraints the system gives us. Sometimes we don't do as well as we might were the resolution freeform. You know what? It's actually okay to follow the rules and mess up the drama a bit. For the same reason that a poet writing a sonnet doesn't break out of meter and rhyme in the third line of the third quatrain even though the poet has a totally great idea that would be so easy to get across if that line were not in iambic pentameter and didn't rhyme with anything, for the same reason an improv comedy troupe doesn't discard the premise an audience member has given them halfway through a sketch, we, the role-players, continue to challenge our own creativity by following rules and being creative anyway. In general the rules are positive and drama-promoting; in a few cases the challenge might overcome us, but we welcome the challenge anyway.<br/><br/>Now I know some people may be thinking, "why not do the same with Rule Zero? Why not let the freeform nature of the rule challenge our ability to structure mechanics or systems or fixes on the fly, and have fun with that?" It's not a good idea because Rule Zero forces us, in the middle of a game, to respond to player concerns at an emotional or social level with mechanical patches. Responding to player concerns with mechanical stuff is a great thing to do during game design, and a ticket to dysfunctional gameplay two hours into a five-hour session. Something happened that wasn't fun or interesting for another player at my table? Wait, why am I trying to fix this problem by adding or subtracting role-playing game mechanics? Role-playing game mechanics are for making up stories, not fixing someone's emotional response to entertainment. That way lies madness. Even when playtesting a game, we generally like to table feedback until after the session is over, rather than arguing over mechanics in mid-session.<br/><br/>Rule Zero's no-system is, of course, a system in and of itself, which admits that some social chaos may result from the course of playing a game. Any other game would tell us, "Change the system, but do still have a system." Rule Zero tells us, "To hell with the system," and then when you throw out the system you find you still have a system, and that throwing out system is system too, and now you have even more system to deal with and weren't you supposed to be getting rid of system?<br/><br/>So confusing.

Make it easy for them to ask you questions about how the game is supposed to work, make it easy for them to see demonstrations of it (Youtube and/or flash animations are awesome as hell for this), and generally be a friendly and helpful resource for them.  If people listen to you and play it your way, maybe some of them will agree with you. Or maybe they won't.<br/><br/>Either way, it's probably not worth your time worrying about it beyond that:  they bought your book, they're going to do whatever they want to with it at their own gaming table.  The most you can do is design the best game you can and explain it the best way you can, and then <i>let it go</i>.

Almost all real world examples I can think of tend to be much hazier than that, and involve a lot of group decision making and shifting shades of authority and interaction with mechanics and explicit rules. Players in lots of "trad" games do rule zero contribute to the game, depending on the game, the culture around the game, the group, and (sometimes) what the game's actual rule zero is and how much it leans towards GM absolutism. <br/><br/>Anyway, back to the original post way back up there... <br/><br/>My experience as a WW player was often that folks (me included) would talk like system didn't matter, but the actual way we played and interacted with the game said very clearly that system did matter.

From your phrasing, it sounds like the GM must either be a totally spineless pushover or else an inflexible dictator.  I think there is a middle ground.  Let me take an example of a larp game that I ran at AmberCon NorthWest last November, called "A Hero's Welcome."  In that, I was the organizer - and I had complete authority.  I could and did a few times declare things about what happened in the game regardless of other rules.  However, for the most part I just listened.  I even physically left the game twice for extended periods to order and then pick up our take-out food - during which time everyone was still playing and the game continued on.  So while I could override things, I usually left the game completely up to the players.  Was I being socially dominated and thus an exception, or were the players disempowered and only allowed to talk to me?  <br/><br/>Now, admittedly, this is an extreme example rather than a typical one.  However, I think it aptly demonstrates a point. I had authority, but I used it sparingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309429/#Comment_309429" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T22:47:22+00:00" title="January 24, 2011 10:47PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2011 10:47PM by droog.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>That may be the winner for "bleakest and most depressing statement made in this thread."

It's useful, though: It describes something that happens under the hand of a shitty GM (or a GM on a bad night, etc). It's a useful term to put in the pocket like "Mary Sue GM NPC", or "roll to do the same thing over and over until you fail", etc. It doesn't happen that often in more collaborative games, but on the other end of the spectrum I've seen "overprotagonization", where every player clamors to have their character do the Most Awesome Thing, and succeed, and it kinda becomes a jumbled mess.<br/><br/>Also, I have played in some of awesome story-gamey games where the rules were tightly defined and in theory perfect, but fell apart because of some unforseen circumstance where the rules kinda prohibited (due to their tightness) the game to get back on track without some real "ok, record scratch; stop; let's back up and do this differently" maneuvering from a player acting for a second as if he were a GM.<br/><br/>And I've played in great games that were broken by crappy players, people not being in the mood, and other human conditions.<br/><br/>I like Rule Zero for games where I know I trust the person who is in the GM chair. I don't like it (or at least I'm wary of it) for games where I'm approaching a table of people I've never gamed with before, like at a con; because crappy things sometimes ensue. The solution to that was easy, and that was to stop playing con games with strangers. :-)<br/><br/>I like collaborative games as well. But they basically offset the problems inherent in one player having all the power, and instead give everyone a little power. You see different, cool dynamics. And I see a lot of people indicating that non-Rule-Zero is the way to go and all, or citing the power of distributed authority, but I've definitely had the sorts of problems that JD was alluding to before. Not with any frequency, mind (but at the same time, the GMs of "rule zero" games that I play with these days don't cause those "Rules-Zero-y issues" as well), but enough to basically go, "Okay, this is just the other side of this game not having the Rule Zero/One GM As God thing". <br/><br/><b>Collaborative-style gaming corrects a problem, with a trade-off of course.</b> It's a trade-off most of us (including JD, from his play reports) buy into when we play these games. Instead of one guy being a dick/not on the ball/etc and messing up a game for the other players, you have things happen like:<br/>* Everyone has differing ideas of what should happen next. Everyone agrees on something in order to keep the game going, but at least a few of the players are kinda like, "Well, this isn't really what I had in mind, but I'll roll with it to make the others happy and keep the game going".<br/>* Everyone has differing ideas of what should happen next. Everyone kinda pushes in a direction because for this particular conflict all the players are really invested in a set of results. It takes far longer, and more strain, to reach a consensus that everyone likes.<br/>* Everyone has differing ideas of what should happen next. Everyone pitches in their ideas, strain to make them all happen as they're all valid, and that scene/conflict/whatever gets really strained. Think of the story of "stone soup", where everyone throws in an ingredient, but in the end the ingredients are very different: Tuna. Ice cream. Kimchee. Frosted Flakes. And everyone has to take a big drink of this mess and deal with it.<br/>* Issues of people who are more (or less) outgoing stepping in too strongly, or not stepping in strongly enough. Y'know, basic people issues.<br/><br/>But no rules, no matter how tightly written, will get around a player who had a bad day, people with issues of trust, boneheads, and so on. I think this was JD's somewhat exaggerated point. I definitely agree with it, because I've seen all those things I listed there. But the tradeoff I made is the better choice for me, because the problems above, while they can be confusing or painful, aren't nearly as painful as some intentional or unintentional Rule Zero stuff.<br/><br/>In the end, I think that most of us posting to this thread are already beyond the whole Rule Zero thing as anything more than an abstract idea: Most of us (particularly folks - like me! - who advocate strongly against Rule Zero in general) had that shitty game experience where a shitty GM did a shitty thing, probably with full knowledge that she or he was being a shit at the time. And it sucked. So when we saw distributed models of play, we jumped on those. Not so much as the abuse victim or whatever (as some folks attribute to other folks into lesser GM powers; they are running away from some abuser situation or somesuch), more like because it was a model where things we like to happen happen more, and the problems associated with distributed play, while real, aren't as painful/disappointing as a big Rule Zero flare-up.<br/><br/>But here's the thing (re Being Beyond Rule Zero for most of us): Distributed play, ownership, etc requires a lot of trust between the players. I mean, duh: Most of us play with our friends, and we trust them, so no problem, right?<br/><br/>Thing is, Rule Zero is a lot about trust as well: If we were to *now* go back to those experiences we had with shitty Rule Zero encounters, we'd probably in most cases recognize much more clearly the underlying human/trust issues that were in play there, and perhaps navigate easily around them with no thought at all, and perhaps even embrace the whole Rule Zero thing again when playing certain kinds of games. <br/><br/>Or use Rule Zero as a qualifier for the game's methods: Sometimes I like playing miniature games, sometimes I like Ameritrash empire-building boardgames, other times I like French abstract boardgames. Likewise, nowadays I like to play a lot in games with distributed player-GM authority. But I can totally go for some GM-as-God traddy McTradpants games (with the right GM I trust, of course!); or games built around Rule Zero but played more distributed-ly (Fading Suns, with group planet/House design, farming of major NPCs to be "owned" by players, solid input into each conflict with the GM having final say, etc); or games with distributed player-GM authority where nonetheless the organizer sets in stone some of the details (Shock: "I want the next game of Shock we play to be about Cloning in the future"; PTA: "I want to be the Producer of a zombie comedy show, if you're in come to my house on Friday night", etc).<br/><br/>Anyway, just my thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309604/#Comment_309604" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T18:44:48+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  6:44PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><br/>My experience of rule zero games has never been that the GM has ultimate authority over everything since I turned 19 or so.

Is it only objectionable when it's used to attack? Thus, PTA Pitch sessions avoid the problem because there's nothing to attack yet?  This seems related to your later point about PTA being "safe" somehow?  <br/><br/>Actually I think this is a pretty cool sidenote that hasn't previously been brought up about fudging/Rule Zero-ing/etc.  I think whose-favor-it's-in might be a really good way of divvying up experiences with this. Like, 75 percent of the time when I Rule Zero-ed die results, it was to keep the player characters moving in the direction they were strongly pushing (even if over a cliff, sometimes especially then.)  Of course there's a lot of grey zones too. Is helping out a bad guy a bit hurting the player characters if it's not immediately directed at them? Probably somewhat.<br/><br/>Still, interesting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>It's a very limited procedure done BEFORE the start of the "proper game", not a overarching "uber-procedure" that trump any other rule in the book.</blockquote>\n?!?  It's not really limited...like, at all. That's one of the big struggles that people have with the Pitch actually. That it is SO wide open, and it affects everything else that's done for the rest of the time. Really the Pitch is pretty much a Rule Zero discussion session for the entire rest of the game. We set our goals, we talk about what we like and don't like, we establish ground rules and expectations, and we will use the written rules to drive in that direction as best they will go.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>It's "social" in the sense of "people talking about what they like", not "social" in the sense of "Only one person decide, all the other try to bully him all the time to get what they want".</blockquote>\nInteresting that you see Rule Zero this way when the clear explicit instructions are simply not to do it this way!  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>A good game is not a game that allow you to "play well with everybody", it's a game that allow you to play well with someone, without ruining the game (and often, the friendship) after a certain amount of time and stress.</blockquote>\nDidn't you just say that Rule Zero proponents couldn't hide behind saying "well, that guy was just a bad GM"?

There is really no way and no reason to protect a still-not-made character at this point.</blockquote>\nWait, hold on, I thought the quintessential Rule Zero setup was "oh my god, this shit roll is going to doom this character to an ignominious death, quick, um, the bad guy's weakness is...string cheese, yeah, and there's some...in his buddy's pocket...you narrowly escape, phew, I saved the game!" not "oh my god, I hate you, new rule, your character dies, get another one."<br><br/>It's exactly the same. If the GM has the "power" to ALWAYS SAVE YOU (your character, your booty, your xp, anything you care about in the game, etc.), EVERY time he does NOT use that "power" he is saying "I didn't save you. So I hate you".<br/><br/>The exact moment you say "the rules in this game don't count, it's the GM that decide everything", you have said "everything that will happen in this game will be the GM's fault", too, at the same time.<br/><br/>From the GM point-of-view, instead, it's "mmm... should I save this xxxxx that the player care about? Did he play well enough to have earned my benevolence? Did he play poorly?" (and - let's not kid ourselves - other thoughts like "he is a whiny S.O.B, I'm better save him or he will ruin the game", "I am tired and they are not even listening to all the things I worked hard to prepare, I am not going to save their sorry asses", "I should save him? But I already saved other three characters, they will not be scared of my monster anymore...  and he is a good player, he will understand that I had reasons to save other three characters in the same exact situation but I didn't do it for him...")\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>It's a very limited procedure done BEFORE the start of the "proper game", not a overarching "uber-procedure" that trump any other rule in the book.</blockquote>\n?!?  It's not really limited...like, at all.<br/><br/>Really?<br/><br/>Try this at a convention game: "For the pitch, I suggest we rule-zero the cards system, let's play with d20 and rolls-to-hit. Please roll the xp of your characters". <br/><br/>(I said "at a convention" because if your usual group is used to rule zero they are used to consider a game rule as not worth anything)<br/><br/>The pitch doesn't give you not even a tiny shard of the power to suppress any tule at will that rule zero give you.  <br/><br/>Really, making a comparison between the two, it's like comparing rule zero with the "power" to choose a name for a NPC ("he decided that name by himself! it's exactly like Rule Zero!") \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>It's "social" in the sense of "people talking about what they like", not "social" in the sense of "Only one person decide, all the other try to bully him all the time to get what they want".</blockquote>\nInteresting that you see Rule Zero this way when the clear explicit instructions are simply not to do it this way!<br/><br/>Actual play. Trump the wishful thinking of careless game designer all the time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>A good game is not a game that allow you to "play well with everybody", it's a game that allow you to play well with someone, without ruining the game (and often, the friendship) after a certain amount of time and stress.</blockquote>\nDidn't you just say that Rule Zero proponents couldn't hide behind saying "well, that guy was just a bad GM"? Aren't you now just hiding behind "well, naturally you can't play with<i>everybody</i>"?<br/><br/>Straw man.<br/><br/>Saying absurdities like that "there are people that I want to play with, and people I don' want to" is like saying "If this game will not work for you it's because you are a bad GM, because the only rule is to do what you want" is exactly as a saying that "I want to choose my new car, because I like some car more than others" is the same as "If this broken down car without tires and without engine will not get you to work fast as a brand-new sport car, it will be your fault because you are not able to run faster"<br/><br/>These example are useful to realize how twisted has become the "logic" of "gamers common sense" after years of "Emperor brand new clothes game systems".  In other hobbies, people would laugh. Gamers instead "believe". The have to, or they would have to admit to having wasted a lot of time and money buying "invisible clothes"<br/><br/>[I will not answer to Suna's post because I DID read about his own problem with his game group in Italian Forums.

JDCorley</cite>?!?! This makes no sense whatsoever. Like...I don't get it at all.  Did anyone in the entirety of history ever say "if this game will not work for you it's because you are a bad GM"? That makes no sense, nobody would ever say or think that in any way ever, forever, period.</blockquote>\nReally? You did never heard or read anyone, anywhere, reply to some complaint about a system or a game with the usual mantra "the problem is not the game system. It was the GM's fault, he should have ignored that rule in that case, it's what a good GM would have done"? (so, it's not the system that has a crappy rule. it's the poor sod who brought the game that is a crappy GM because he did follow it).<br/><br/>I must assume at this point that we obviously live in different but parallel universes, that in some way interact in this forum.  <br/><br/>But I think that there is a "JDCorley" in this universe, too, that is posting in this thread, and I have some problem in understanding who is who. For example, he replied this to another part of my post:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Dude, I'm not going to apologize for saving the whiny SOB and not ruining the game for the other 4 people sitting at the table and I'm not ever going to believe that doing this is a bad thing! You just said "no, it is better if I follow the rules, and absolutely ruin this game and all the enjoyment of every single person than bend the rules even just this one time".  Can you not see how insane and fucked up that seems?</blockquote>\nSo, THAT JDCorley think that a GM who follow the rules instead of "saving" (hand-waving the system) that player character EVERY TIME, is "insane and fucked up". But he think that in that situation it still exist a "game to ruin". "Ruin" in which way?  By following its rules.<br/><br/>So, for that JDCorley, there are games that can be "ruined" by the simple act of following their rules, but that still doesn't make them "insane and fucked up games". It's the GM's fault if he follow them.<br/><br/>But in YOUR universe, JDCorley never, ever, saw or heard anyone, ever, say that if a rule could ruin a game, it's the GM's fault if he follow it. He never heard anyone calling "insane and fucked up" a GM only because he followed them instead of ignoring them.<br/><br/>This reminds me of a old Star Trek episode. It would be really interesting if there was a way to make these two JDCorley meet. Imagine how many things they could discuss between them, if they could share their experiences...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309785/#Comment_309785" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T13:37:14+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  1:37PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're the one that invented the situation where a game would be ruined if you strictly followed a particular rule in a situation, not me!  You were bragging about ruining a game session, and I was saying, that is fucked up, really fucked up.<br/><br/>And this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>"the problem is not the game system. It was the GM's fault, he should have ignored that rule in that case, it's what a good GM would have done"</blockquote>\nis very different from "this game is only good if you're a good GM". Actually what you write there isn't a defense of the game or game system at all, on the contrary it's an acknowledgement of a problem, and a suggestion on how to fix the problem in play. It's not a defense of the game at all! Nobody would ever defend a game by saying "wow, you're right, that rule stinks like stinky cheese, don't use it".  It's not a defense of the game, you're absolutely right.<br/><br/>Perhaps I did exaggerate, on reflection.  Maybe there actually are some story games that are only good when people with particular skills play them. I can't really think of any off the top of my head. (Burning Wheel, maybe?)  Baron Munchausen! There's one. If you're a crap storyteller, that game is not any good for you or anyone else at the table.  Even if you're good, if your tastes are different from other people's, there's no means to resolve that conflict in play unless you stop and mess things around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera" title="XanatosChimera"><img alt="XanatosChimera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera">XanatosChimera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310163/#Comment_310163" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T17:36:53+00:00" title="January 29, 2011  5:36PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2011 5:37PM by XanatosChimera.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It almost seems like the Rule Zero debate comes down to whether one is treating an RPG like a game of Chess or Go, where the rules are immutable.  Or whether it is handled more like a "let's pretend" with a general framework of mechanics with one (or more ppl) acting as mediators or referees.  If one takes it to be the former, then Rule Zero cannot and should not ever be applied, but if the latter then none of the rules are absolute and immutable and it comes down to the makeup and dynamic of the individual group and their particular social contract for gaming.  The RPG system is the trellis with the individual rules acting like the lattice that makes up the trellis, but one can alter the geometry of the lattice without ruining the trellis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310320/#Comment_310320" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T17:14:57+00:00" title="January 31, 2011  5:14PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the whole "Rule Zero" debate has been around for a while, of course, and while I have many thoughts on that topic, I should maybe leave them out. <br/><br/>That said, I think there is a major difference between "System Matters" games and "System Doesn't Matter" games, and it has a lot to do with presentation and the promise of the games themselves.<br/><br/>* A lot of these earlier games were extremely fond of telling us how You Could Do Anything with them. Be anyone! Experience the stories of your dreams! Explore new worlds! Our game can do EVERYTHING!<br/><br/>* I give a lot of respect to modern designs that are totally honest up-front about what they do well, and what they do not do well. By saying, "you will not enjoy this game if you don't like having your character die in the first five minutes", or maybe, "this game may subject you to your own childhood fears and could make you cry," you reduce the need for a large and very visible <i>Rule Zero</i> tremendously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div
