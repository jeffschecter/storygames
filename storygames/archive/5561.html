For that purpose, do you think you could suggest a GMing / Adventure building procedure?  I know this is currently in the text as "will be filled in later" but some basic advice like "all scenes start as monster attacks" or whatever would be very welcome.<br/><br/>I'd like to GM it but  I don't want to GM it like I GM D&amp;D, if that makes any sense.  "Like I GM D&amp;D" is a very mentally intense process regardless of stats, which I don't think is right for RBH.<br/><br/>Edit: Sorry, this was meant to be private to Eric, but I guess it's OK in public.

I'm still working on that bit.</p>\n<p>Try this for prep:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write down a treasure.  Note why it's valuable.  Something other than pure monetary value.</li>\n<li>Sketch out a monster.  Don't worry about attributes or powers yet.  Note why the monster is a monster.  What horrible things does it do or is it threatening to do?</li>\n<li>Sketch out a handful of NPCs.  Each NPC must be related to the treasure or the monster or both.  Consider giving NPCs relationships to each other and to the PCs.</li>\n<li>Scribble out a couple of ideas for really nifty places to explore.</li>\n<li>Writing some background story for the players to discover is cool.  Writing how the game should pan out is not.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then GM like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with some exposition scenes.  Introduce the location, the NPCs, the treasure, and the monster to the PCs.  Take your time with this.  Savor it.  </li>\n<li>Have the NPCs decide to try to use the PCs to get something.  Use the NPCs' relationships to the monster and the treasure to fuel the NPCs' desires.</li>\n<li>Have the monster do something horrible.  Let the PCs try to stop it.  If they fail to stop it, ask the players if they want to kill the monster.  Assuming that they didn't already try that.</li>\n<li>After high-tempo scenes, return to low-tempo exposition scenes.  Let the players flesh out their characters through interaction with each other, NPCs, and their surroundings.</li>\n<li>Don't plan on any fights happening.  Let the players decide when it's time to pull out the map &amp; minis.  If you really want a fight to happen, keep up the horribleness with the monster (and sometimes with NPCs) until the players can't take it anymore and someone pulls a sword.</li>\n<li>Don't let mooks fight on their own.  Mooks aren't brave without a leader.</li>\n<li>I love NPCs that give the PCs bad information.  Liars and lunatics give the PCs something to form opinions about when the real information comes to light.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's about all I have right now.

It could be a type of monster, a certain NPC, a location, a particular scene (fight under a waterfall!), or a thing (even a treasure).<br/><br/>--The GM gets to collect XPs (or something like that) from the players for each of these things she can include in the game.<br/><br/>The things the players name also sort of work as an "Oracle", in the Wicked sense.<br/><br/>There's also the possibility of having character elements that interact to create an adventure. For instance, each character has a Quest (something they're looking for: e.g. "to save the Princess from an incurable disease) and a Fear (something that scares them shitless: e.g. "monsters that were once women"). It the beginning of a session, they write down a specific thing, person, or item that would advance them in their Quest, and a specific manifestation of their Fear. (e.g. "A petal of the rare Wintershade flower" and "An undead sorceress with skeletal wings")<br/><br/>The GM then combines those elements to create the adventure.<br/><br/>Obviously, I'm just brainstorming. I haven't really worked this out.<br/><br/>Eric, the advice you just posted, above, is wonderful, too. I know some of it is in the RBH already, but it should ALL be in there.<br/><br/>Cheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124757/#Comment_124757" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-06T09:51:50+00:00" title="February  6, 2008  9:51AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have an idea on this, Eric, that I'd like to talk about.

So The players knew that finding out about the monster, treasure, some NPCs and the adventure's where about was their goal.<br/><br/>SO they'd have other goals but at some point they'd be like "I want to ask around and find out if there have been any problems cropping up lately."  or "I hear that some children are missing and the only signs of their disappearacne is a fine black powder."  As the GM I set a few dangers in their path "You might piss off a village elder" or "If you tip off one of the villainous PCs he'll get a Advantage die at the start of any confrontation."  We roll and I write down the outcome.<br/><br/>They know that once they fill out the baic four questions (monster, treasure, NPC, location) then they can go to the adventure.  The longer they wait and build the more the adventure will be worth and the greater the rewards.<br/><br/>SO I didn't plan a single thing when I went to the table at Dreamation.
