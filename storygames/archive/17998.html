Not sure if he's played it yet but I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised -- John has mentioned playing D&amp;D when he was younger.<br/><br/>Anyway, the podcast has like 100k listeners so it's nice to see Dungeon World get that kind of positive exposure.<br/><br/>Edit: sorry, <a href="http://johnaugust.com/2013/wed-like-to-make-an-offer" rel="nofollow">here's the link to the ep.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406676/#Comment_406676" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-19T19:28:49+00:00" title="February 19, 2013  7:28PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2013 7:29PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!
