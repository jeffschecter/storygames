I'd like to bounce them around and get some input.<br/><br/>Sometime last year, I was approached on an internet forum by a gamer from my town who was looking to put together a Werewolf game.  I've never had any feelings more favorable than "Agree to disagree" on the subject of World of Darkness games (a subject for another discussion), so I was pretty hesitant about this one.  However, the fellow was pretty encouraging, and seemed open-minded enough with his concepts of the game, so I took the bite and went with it.  I'm pretty down with free-form, player-driven games, so I was excited.<br/><br/>After the initial interface was when the breakdown happened.  When trying to come up with a character idea, I was hitting some blanks.  It'd been a while since I played in a tabletop WoD game, and even longer since that game was specifically one about werewolves.  So I pressed the guy for some more input into the situation.  Since I never like playing "lone wolf" characters, I asked for some guideline information on the other characters, how to relate to them, and maybe some basic information on some of the directions the GM wanted to go with.  What was the planned focus?  What story was being told here?  Was there a main theme at hand?  Was this going to be a global game, or exist mostly within the society and intrigues of the local community?  What elements can you give me that would be a good idea to work into my concept and backstory?<br/><br/>Due to a problem with our communication (at least, I hope it was just that), the GM immediately startd accusing me of trying to meta-game, trying to "break his story" and such.  He said that by asking for background information, I was trying to "win the game" without even playing it, and that if he were to tell me anything about the story, there would be no point in playing it, and it wouldn't be fair, and yadda yadda yadda.  He said "just make a character" and actually refused to give any guidelines or input at all.  Huh.  Weird.  I'm not used to 100% hands-off GMs, but still what the hey?  A bit put off by his rigidity and his accusatory attitude, I shrugged it off and gave it a second go.  As a career GM, I wanted to play again, for it had been so long!<br/><br/>So I figured I would just come up with some random concepts, throw them out as a test to see what the guy thought of them, and if rejected, hopefully I would get some criticism or direction on character ideas more suitable for the game.  I mulled over some "just crate a character" ideas, and finally started banging one out.  I had been watching a lot of "Avatar: The Last Airbender" at that time, and was very much in love with the character portrayal of Uncle Iroh.  I took that premise and tooled it into a character that seemed would be fun to play.  The idea was for an older man, maybe early 50s, who had been a powerful werewolf in the past, perhaps a notable figure in the community.  However, due to some dark and tragic "unstated plot device event from the past", he would no longer have these powers, refuse to acknowledge his past, and refuse to live his role as a werewolf.  He would be exiled from his old community for some reason or another, and play a similar role to that of Iroh, or perhaps the exiled firebender guy from another episode of that show: the grizzled old advisor, unwilling guide who must rediscover, redevelop, and accept the responsibilities of his powers, "The Beast" who must learn to love again, the heart of gold that must be warmed once more.  A big homage to the "with great power comes great responsibility" concept, with a twist.<br/><br/>I got excited.  The character sounded like a lot of fun!  When I bounced this idea at the GM, however, instead of discussing it with me and working with the idea, or suggesting a way to tone it down, or even just offering advice on how to make a more fitting character, he threw insults at me and accused me of wanting to meta-game, power-game, and spoil his game.<br/><br/>End of transaction, I bailed.  I just couldn't put up with it anymore.  I felt like I was being accused of multiple offenses of which I was innocent, and my only crime was actually being interested in playing in a game run by a GM who refused to offer any help or insight.  I should have stuck with my initial hesitancies and the whole negative interactions could have been avoided.<br/><br/>Perhaps there were communication issues.  Perhaps there were personal issues.  Perhaps we were incompatible.  Perhaps he was trying to run one of those visionless, unfocused, ambiguous games with no story or direction that are expected to just go on and on but in reality tend to fail hard.  I'm not sure.  My question: is my analysis of the breakdown correct?  Was I power-gaming by asking to play a "once powerful leader of men" type of character?  Was I meta-gaming by asking the GM to tell me a bit more about the story he wanted to tell?  Or was the GM overreacting?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73586/#Comment_73586" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T10:56:50+00:00" title="June  4, 2007 10:56AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: phasmaphobic</cite>I'm pretty down with free-form, player-driven games</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: phasmaphobic</cite>the GM immediately startd accusing me of trying to meta-game, trying to "break his story"</blockquote>\nThese two are a bit mutually exclusive, unfortunately.

But from my experiences as a GM, I've learned that sometimes when a player approaches you with a similar concept, they have more of a roleplaying focus in mind.  I was looking to roleplay the lack of power where it was once great, the pity and shame where there was once respect, and the eventual goal to not only regain all of that (at a rate equal to everyone else, of course), but to also develop the actual <i>desire</i> to regain it.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm pretty glad I didn't end up playing in that game.  I imagine it would have only gotten worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73593/#Comment_73593" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T12:01:41+00:00" title="June  4, 2007 12:01PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Steven has pointed out, the Uncle Iroh concept is also not one that is well supported by the World of Darkness games, which assume a pretty strict equation of age/experience = power.  Actual magic powers aside, even the "been around the block" experience would negate the built-in adventure foundation of, "you are a nobody in a terrifying society, here's a guy who wants you to do something to earn some scrap of favor."  The game mechanics all but assume that you are newly embraced/changed/chrysalized/whatever, and deviating from that tends to break the game.  Which it would have been nice if the GM had explained, rather than assume you were trying to circumvent and 'cheat'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73602/#Comment_73602" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T12:16:11+00:00" title="June  4, 2007 12:16PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite><br/>Actual magic powers aside, even the "been around the block" experience would negate the built-in adventure foundation of, "you are a nobody in a terrifying society, here's a guy who wants you to do something to earn some scrap of favor."<br/></blockquote>\nAnd there you've identified one of the major (of many) reasons behind my previously-stated "Hrmmm... meh" opinions of WoD.

I mean, you can make a thousand year old starting Vampire character with considerable magical power with standard starting WoD rules. (He just won't have many skills, probably as a result of spending all his time fucking around with considerable magical power.)  Anyway, this has nothing to do with WoD AT ALL and shame on everyone trying to do so. For shame! <br/><br/>You had a vision for character creation: you wanted it to be communal and give-and-take, and he did too: he wanted it to be straightforward and individual. That is not a WoD problem. You would get the same problem in D&amp;D3 or GURPS. "Hey, what skills would be good to have in this game" is the same question as "Hey, would being an old bastard who lost all his power be good in this game".<br/><br/>This is a relationship problem over a matter of taste.

I don't recall yet attributing the communication issues to a WoD issue, at least I hope I didn't.  My dislikes for WoD are many, though, and for another thread at another time.  I'd explain more about this here, but I think it would be too far off-topic.  I'll end it with this note: all of my experiences with WoD have been similar to this, thus my mention of initial hesitation.  Note, too, that despite my issues with WoD, I actually worked to put that predilection aside and try to develop an interest in the game <i>before</i> the communication issues started breaking things apart.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm hoping my approach wasn't too awful.  I probed with questions, got insults but no answers, probed again with ideas and that time only got insults.  Regardless of the character concept or whatever levels of power-gaming might have been present, the guy should have been a bit more diplomatic.  Story issues aside, his lack of tact and communication skills were probably proof that the game would just not have been fun for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73648/#Comment_73648" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T14:37:50+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  2:37PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We are only hearing things from your point of view, but let me put this out there:<br/><br/>You will never get an answer to a question any other way than asking it.<br/><br/>It sounded to me that at least from your point of view, you did everything right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73652/#Comment_73652" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T14:47:37+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  2:47PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I knew the other guy's POV, I'd gladly give it.<br/><br/>And I'm not sure where you're going with that second bit.

Sadly (and truthfully), I've received more than a handful of "dual-(insert weapon here) wielding (insert anachronistic character race/alignment combo here) ranger" concepts in that lot of problematic uninformed ideas.  Now, I <i>always</i> try to find out more about the campaign before I develop a character concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73671/#Comment_73671" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T16:09:36+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  4:09PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have never run any WoD, but as JD says, I doubt that's the issue.<br/><br/>All I can say is that if you turned up to one of my games asking those kinds of questions, you'd be as welcome as a cold drink in the Sahara.

I've never really been involved in WoD stuff, but the stories that I used to hear from people who played it seemed full of complaints about "powergamers" interfering with "roleplaying" or "the story".<br/><br/>It seems to me that the WoD games provide environments that are beautiful for gamist power struggle ("Can we (the players) overthrow the prince?", "Can I diablerise (sp?) down to 4th gen?"), but they also attract a lot of people who are looking for something else entirely (collaborative literary storytelling, character immersion etc). If this guy falls into the latter category he may have been burnt before by powergamers and be paranoid about them. His behaviour still sounds absurd, mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73737/#Comment_73737" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T05:59:39+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  5:59AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: phasmaphobic</cite> I was looking to roleplay the lack of power where it was once great, the pity and shame where there was once respect, and the eventual goal to not only regain all of that (at a rate equal to everyone else, of course), but to also develop the actual <i>desire</i>to regain it.</blockquote>\nAlthough I remember the WoD system having lots of mechanics for individual character skills and powers (so your character could start with these at normal starting levels and 'regain' them at normal development rates), does it have comparable mechanics for your character's social connections and relationships? Without these, the GM might be concerned that you'd use at-the-table social pressure and appeals to 'common sense' ("Come on! I saved this guy's life a dozen times - no way would he just ignore me.") to exploit your character's background for in-game power.<br/><br/>Wouldn't surprise me if he'd been burnt by this before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73750/#Comment_73750" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T07:53:08+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  7:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IIRC, there are backgrounds you can purchase at the time of creation, and "Allies", "Status", and "Contacts" are all options.
