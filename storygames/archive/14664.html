Plus the brief examples - these are the kinds of things you should be saying.<br/><br/>Some popular games lately have done away with the "GM sets difficulty" thing, but I've realized it's a really powerful way to make sure your SiS is in sync on a moment-to-moment basis.<br/>"GM: Difficulty 6.  <br/>Player:  Difficulty 6?  Say what now?  <br/>GM:  You're scaling this sheer wall without equipment?  <br/>Player:  Oh, I thought it was kind of a rocky cliff face."<br/>It requires understanding &amp; negotiation of the SiS in a way that "Yes, and..." doesn't.<br/><br/>Players can't lose:  not only can they not die, but failure leads to success later. <br/><br/>The die mechanic is sneakily in-your-favor:  when I hear "difficulty 3" it feels like I need 6 dice for a 50% shot, but really I only need 5 dice.<br/><br/>"Ask questions. Don't plan." Helps to make sure a GM who is new to improvisational GMing doesn't get stuck. Kind of the same point Todd was making, I guess.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite>First, the document itself is beautiful</blockquote>\nYeah, I think that's huge just for getting it in front of people and making them want to give it a try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333622/#Comment_333622" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-08T12:16:56+00:00" title="July  8, 2011 12:16PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2011 12:17PM by Ry.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Everybody knows how to play Steampunk Star Wars.

It becomes this mantra, sometimes more than just the player taking action will say it, "One for trying..." It encourages you to get up and do things. Same thing with taking XP. It opens up the game. I often will remind players to take XP, then they will start to do and then ask if its okay (XP = chips on the table, I always use chips so I can visually see that I'm helping everyone hit their Keys). Then by the end of the session, they reach for it and at most give me a head nod and I head nod back.<br/><br/>But the previously suggested reasons of "Steampunk", beautiful art, compelling male and female characters, and all of the rules you need to know on one sheet of paper are huge.<br/><br/>But I think another factor is that it screams ROMANCE and ADVENTURE instead of COMBAT.

For someone who doesn't know to look deeper, I can imagine that to be an even bigger detriment. <br/><br/>Also, the thing is only a few pages. That is not intimidating like a huge rpg text. Not considering time, there's a reason I always pull out "Forbidden Island" for new board gamers instead of "Agricola", even though I want to play the latter much more.  <br/><br/>(On a side note, RPG designers, make more rules like the rule books to Forbidden Island, Pandemic, and Dominant Species!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333690/#Comment_333690" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T11:18:47+00:00" title="July  9, 2011 11:18AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2011 11:24AM by zircher.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those that don't have Pandemic, you can find an authorized copy of the rules here:<br/><a href="http://files.boardgamegeek.com/file/download/2ccgatudzy/Pandemic_Rules.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://files.boardgamegeek.com/file/download/2ccgatudzy/Pandemic_Rules.pdf</a><br/><br/>Gamewright posts their rules here:<br/><a href="http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/pdfs/Rules/ForbiddenIslandTM-RULES.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/pdfs/Rules/ForbiddenIslandTM-RULES.pdf</a><br/><br/>And, GMT posts their Dominant Species rules here:<br/><a href="http://www.gmtgames.com/domspecies/DomSpec_Rules_FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gmtgames.com/domspecies/DomSpec_Rules_FINAL.pdf</a><br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/>[Not trying to steal Jesse's thunder, but I do not have those games.

The experienced players chose Kale and Naomi, and the new guy picked the Captain.  We had been playing a couple other games earlier in the day, so he was starting to get the hang of it, but he was a little unsure of how to play the captain at first.  The Kale player immediately started to take charge, when I remembered the suggestion in the rules about asking PCs how they feel about the actions of the other PCs.  I asked the Captain player what he thought about the first mate taking command, when the player surprised me by saying he wanted to drop the Key of Command.  That took us all back, and after thinking about it for a second, I strongly suggested that he reconsider.  I figured that losing that aspect of the character would make it much more difficult to play, especially for a new player.  In the end, we convinced the player to keep it, but gave him this advice: anytime anyone makes a suggestion, immediately shut it down, but then say it again as if it were his own idea, and let Kale say, "That's a great idea!"  That helped immensely.  A better GM than I would probably have found a way to let the player lose the key and still be interesting... what do you guys think?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, we found our way to the Pirate King at the end of the session, and right as the game was about to end, with the NPC (and really obnoxioius) Lady Blackbird about to run to the arms of the waiting King, the Captain player surprised us all by declaring his love (that he had hidden/forgotten about until now, haha).  He ended up defeating the sorcerous Pirate King and usurped his throne.  I can't wait to run this game again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Insanodag" title="Insanodag"><img alt="Insanodag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Insanodag">Insanodag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333819/#Comment_333819" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T05:45:13+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  5:45AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think there is a single thing about  Lady Blackbird that makes it perform so well with newbieish players, but several.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first is the basic plot of unrequited love, dashing pirates and the wild blue yonder. You have to have a heart of stone or a neckbeard of iron bristles not to immediately want to leap into the world.<br/>\nThis gets the player into the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second is the ways the keys are presented.If you don't remember playing an RPG for the first time, most of that time can be spent worrying about whether or not you are doing it right, or what you should be doing at all. The keys are a basic instruction manual as to what to do in play. In most situations the keys present one or more clear courses of action that the player can take. I discussed LB with my partner and a first-time rpg'er and what they pointed out was that they didn't have to worry about doing what they thought their character would do. Also, the immediate reward of pool dice or experience, means that the player doesn't have to sit and wonder "am I doing it wrong", their behaviour is immediately rewarded by the game. This way the new player feels that their in-game actions are approved by the game itself, and make them feel more comfortable about playing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe simplicity of the rules help, but I think the keys and the basic plot are more important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333851/#Comment_333851" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T09:30:54+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  9:30AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent points so far.<br/><br/>One of the other things I think it does really well is provide some structure to classically-understructured social issues.<br/><br/>Things like: who is the leader?  what goals should we pursue?  how do I feel about the other characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
