I think it went reasonably well, but I think I may have overstepped my Dealer prerogatives.<br/><br/>A player won narration in a four-way conflict and narrated the death of a supporting character who was standing nearby and who was not even in the conflict.  The NPC was an important one with a Devil and who had taken very little Harm (was nowhere near her "End")<br/><br/>I said something to the effect of, "I'm going to put the kibosh on that as Dealer; I'm not sure but I don't think you can end an supporting character's life like that who isn't at her "End."  My main motivation in vetoing that part of his narration was because there was another player who seemed wrapped up in her story and had more plans for her, but I also thought at the time that I had mechanical support for my ruling.<br/><br/>But on review I'm not entirely sure.  Page 31 indicates "the Narrator has total authority in telling the story for the duration of the conflict."  There is an example of a player-controlled character, "Gentleman" Jim, <i>almost </i>killing a supporting character, Jack Kerrigan, on p41, but that is when Jim is at his End, is in direct conflict with Jack, and reduces every one of Jack's scores to 0 using his chips.<br/><br/>Complicating the matter is that I ruled shortly after that another supporting character who <i>was</i> in a conflict and had just taken Harm, but was not yet at <i>his</i> End was dead.  (I had narration and the the player character that ran to get the doc lolly-gagged because he wanted the supporting character to bleed out).  This I did because he was shot from a few feet away by a Civil War hero player character, because I thought his death was necessary to move the story forward, and because it gave a couple players something they wanted to happen.  There probably would have been time-consuming follow-up conflicts to whittle him down to nothing shortly after.  Since his eventual death seemed certain, why not just cut to the chase, I reasoned?<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm just wondering what others think.  There's the rules, and then there's the value of being consistent, and then there's the Dealer's responsibility to keep the game moving and help keep things fun for everyone.  My main case rests on that responsibility and that the supporting character in the initial crossfire wasn't even in the conflict.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232089/#Comment_232089" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T08:32:46+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  8:32AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A, character death. It's always a pain in the ass in my games because they mechanize character death while simultaneously giving "total power" to narrators. These two thing butt heads. It happens in Nine Worlds, too. A player narrates an NPC "dead" but that NPC still has scores. What to do? <br/><br/>The rules actually allow narrators to deliver Harm even if people didn't take any. But, the text isn't very explicit about the issue you raise.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to set those characters at The End regardless of their scores at the time. The narrator "kills" 'em ... but give 'em one more scene. <br/><br/>That way, the supporting characters still have something to "say" but the narrator's scene is a bit more satisfactory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232115/#Comment_232115" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T15:19:19+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  3:19PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever this happens, go to fictional actions.<br/><br/>Instead of "I kill her with my Narrative Powerz!" the Narrator <i>says what happens</i>. "She's shot through the lung, coughing and going pale" or "She drops like a stone, blood splashed everywhere," or whatever it is that happens in the fiction. Then it's a lot easier to judge what's what. Maybe she's at her End, maybe she takes Harm, maybe someone jumps in and tries to save her life or calmly reloads and finishes her off, etc.<br/><br/>Stuff happens on screen, in other words, and that leads to other stuff (and maybe more conflicts).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232222/#Comment_232222" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T08:42:17+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  8:42AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My instincts were the same in that perhaps there could be a follow up conflict to determine what happened to her.  She wasn't in the initial conflict, nor was the  player character who was somewhat emotionally attached to her on the scene.  The player did say what happened, but included the narration that she was killed.  I felt the need to "back things up a bit," but did so with a kludgy Dealer veto instead of suggesting that.<br/><br/>On reflection, I might have also used her sole chip to outbid the Narrator for that single part of his narration, so as to gauge how strongly he felt about that part of his contribution, he had four chips and could have easily outbid me if he was insistent.  I'd given each of the player characters three chips to start the one-shot and one chip to each of the supporting characters.<br/><br/>It's hard when you have a strong instinct about what will make a more satisfying story, but someone makes a different choice than you might.  I thought it was important for the arc of the emotionally attached player character that she not die yet.  I think in those cases where the rules are not clear, I should just respect the players' choices; who's to say I know better what is going to end up making for a better story?<br/><br/>Thanks for the input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232227/#Comment_232227" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T08:57:10+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  8:57AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my thought on games that allow you narrate death.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can't.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the real world you can never actually "kill" someone.  Its impossible.  You can stab them 43 times.  You can put a car bomb under their seat.  You can empty your pistol into their torso at point blank range.  You can smash their skull in with a pipe.  But there is no time when you can simply say "I kill them" and have it be so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the real world you can find examples of people who actually survived all of the above things.  So clearly "intent to kill" does not equal "actually killed".<br/>\n<br/>\nSo building upon John's advice above...never let them say "I kill them".  Make them say what they do that one would expect death to be the most likely outcome.  And then proceed with whatever system your particular game has...a follow up conflict to see if they pull through and survive would seem eminently reasonable here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
