hey people <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/>I just got <b>Unsung</b><br/><br/>I've read through most of it, and there's something that doesn't seem right about Gifts<br/><br/>the way I understand the text, when someone gives you a Gift (which means that they present your character with some kind of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">uncomfortable</span> moral dilemma), you can veto it, and it's like nothing happened<br/><br/>that strikes me as weak<br/><br/>I mean, if, in a game, you have the right to prevent bad things from happening to your character, it should at least cost you some kind of resource, right?<br/><br/>like in Polaris or Trollbabe, for example<br/><br/>and if you can just veto, other players are going to pull their punches, so that their Gifts don't get vetoed, right?<br/><br/>so am I reading the rules wrong here, or is that really how it works?<br/><br/>and if it does really work like that, am I the only one who thinks it's lame?<br/><br/><br/>cheers!<br/><br/>edited to clarify that Gifts are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">uncomfortable</span> moral

                 Yeh, Gifts are interesting. They're definitely a social feedback mechanism, and the veto is something that will have different standings with different groups. Basically, Unsung is very "Never Getting Hurt" as opposed to "I Will Not Abandon You" in that you can't ever force someone to allow their character to get hurt, but you can offer to do so. <br/><br/>Unsung is also definitely aimed at upfront lets-play-characters-with-issues-in-harsh-situations play (aka "facestabby"). I think, if you're interested in that kind of play, the veto thing won't be a problem; if you're not, the game won't really have a lot of meaning in it. This is one of the things I mention in my <a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2006/02/09/my-thoughts-on-unsung/" rel="nofollow">thoughts on Unsung</a> from a couple of years ago. It was a big inspiration for <strong>carry</strong>, but I decided to take a stronger stance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154968/#Comment_154968" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T08:49:07+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  8:49AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben:<br/><br/>I'll take your word for it, since I haven't played the game myself<br/><br/>but doesn't that make the veto rule useless?<br/><br/><br/>Nathan:<br/><br/>interesting thoughts<br/><br/>I think I completely agree with what you say<br/><br/>so how about replacing the veto rule in <b>Unsung </b>with lines and veils?<br/><br/>does anyone know what the author's stance is on this issue?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155061/#Comment_155061" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T00:58:07+00:00" title="July  6, 2008 12:58AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite>so we talked with Filip about this, and I realized that I need some kind of incentive to let my character be hurt<br/><br/>if I can have him be fine without it costing me anything, I'll pick that option every single time</blockquote>Interestingly, I look for ways to hurt my character.

Because of the veto, they have to think about the gift they give, craft it so it will fit and wont be thrown away. It's like when you buy someone a birthday present - you try and buy something they wont just stick in a cupboard somewhere and forget about. It's more about prompting creativity in the gift giver, than in protecting the gift reciever. That'd be my estimate, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155555/#Comment_155555" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T21:31:43+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  9:31PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Incidentally, I have a copy of Unsung.
