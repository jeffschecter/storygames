                            I'm with Adam on this.<br/><br/>Dysfunction can and does show up in all of the Creative Agendas.  So what?  I've argued that deprotagonization is CA dependent.  It takes a different form in each of the different CA's.  OK.  Nothing particularly controversial about that.<br/><br/>That the wiki poorly represents what was discussed?  I'm not going to disagree.<br/><br/>So, to reiterate Adam's question - what are you looking to accomplish?                        </div>

                            Purp of this thread is that…<br/>there is this norm that you can't say "I think this is good gaming, I think this is bad gaming" when it comes to <i>some</i> things but no such taboo when it comes to <i>other</i> things. I've been feeling (and will probably continue to feel) guilty for making wide blanket statements on the applicability of blorbiness to all roleplaying.<br/><br/>But there are so many things that are more OK to consider to be bad and bad roleplaying, bad GMing and so on. That's what I wanted to examine. Why do I feel like I've stepped in an electric fence everytime I say it should all be blorb!<br/> </div>

                            Isn't that probably part of why The Forge ended up so focused on Actual Play?<br/><br/>If everyone at the table enjoys unblorby play then it's not going to be dysfunctional. If you join and you don't have fun, then it is, even if nothing else has changed about the game. The Dysfunction wiki entry, notably, is focused on symptoms.<br/><br/>"I had a bad experience doing X" (or even "I have never had a good experience doing X") is very different from "X is universally bad."                        </div>

                            That webpage is definitely not what I should strive to emulate. I need to remember that.<br/>But I get flak for saying that I think play should be blorby.<br/><br/>You're right that the analogy breaks down.

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I like the Blorb principles, to a point, but if I followed them rigidly, I would not enjoy running games anymore. <br/><br/>I don't enjoy a lot of prep, memorizing stuff, or long lookups during play. I tend to replace deep prep with a rule like "create principles which guide making up stuff on the fly, and stick to them." <br/><br/>You'd probably hate playing in my games!

                            Unlike Adam, I love blorb principles but I would be quite happy to apply them strictly, and have done so a fair bit in my long-ago gaming history.<br/>(Although i agree that it is often not practical.)<br/><br/>However, MOST of my gaming since then has not been blorby at all (except for some OSR play), and it’s been some of the best gaming I’ve ever had.<br/><br/>For instance, over in my Dogs in the Vineyard thread, I’m exploring some seriously anti-blorby techniques which seem to be making the game a lot better.<br/><br/>It’s hard to take a statement about unblorby play always being bad when I’d have to somehow rethink my life and consider most of the gaming I’m doing now and have done (like Dogs) and many of the games I see other people enjoying (like much/most of what I see in Gauntlet games!) as Totally Bad and Not Fun.<br/><br/>I think it’s possible to convince someone how something they think is fun is actually bad, but you’d have to really demonstrate (a) how it’s bad in the first place, in very clear terms, and (b) show them how to make it better.<br/><br/> </div>

                            And as for myself, if I chose to run a game for which the rules were written in a blorby way, then I'd run it in a blorby way, since I strive to run the game the designer intended, judging by the spirit of the system.  But I wouldn't <i>volunteer</i> to run such a game these days.  Someone I care about would have to really want me to do it.<br/><br/>We've already ascertained that you wouldn't enjoy playing in my games either.

                            The specific way I've tried to achieve blorb so far definitely isn't perfect or perfectly satisfying <i>especially</i> when it comes to other concerns.<br/><br/>But let's examine <i>un</i>blorb.

What are some examples?<br/><br/>What's the core gameplay loop of unblorb?<br/><br/><i>Unmoderated, unilateral insertion or manipulation of game state entities.</i><br/><br/>By one person: the GM. That's ultimately what we're looking at when we're looking at unblorb (or antiblorb, which is "unblorb presented as if it were blorb"—but let's stick to examining unblorb for now, that's enough of a can of worm).                        </div>

                            I take a lot of flak personally from you and others for believing, with my limited dataset, and my fragile human perspective, that unblorb is almost always a bad game play interaction.<br/><br/>Saying that games that use the traditional GM/PC role division should always be blorby is very taboo. The norm is to only speak of your own game table and <i>any</i> type of universal statements are met with shock.<br/><br/>But the point of the thread was to point out that there are gameplay patterns that even the most unblorby of unblorby GM would also concede was dysfunctional and bad. As yukamichi correctly pointed out, that was a bad argument on my behalf because a lot of those more universally reviled game play patterns are more <i>obvious</i> and <i>apparent</i>sources of unhappiness for at least some of the participants. After that was pointed out, I kinda agreed that the thread wouldn't really serve its purpose well.<br/><br/>For example hitting your fellow players physically at the gaming table is something that I would generally recommend to <i>not</i> do, for any one, unless you really really know what you're doing. I would never say "oh well that's something any group can decide for themselves". I mean, they <i>can</i>. But I can still make a general <i>recommendation</i> and say that table top roleplaying game should <i>generally</i> not involve physically hitting your fellow players. I don't have any power to enforce that recommendation. I don't have any way to come and take your hitting stick away from you.<br/><br/>So in tabletop RPG, ever since unblorby techniques were invented, initially used <i>anti</i>-blorbily (i.e. presented as blorb), we've slowly gotten this culture of "ok this stuff is going on but we are accepting it". For example, it is taboo to call fudging "cheating" or even sometimes to call it "fudging". (Which, fine, if using those names makes it impossible to talk about it because they have such loaded connotations then we can call it something else, that's fine by me as long as we talk about it.)<br/><br/>The reason I started the thread was to sort of defend my self for all the hate I'm getting for saying that I think games should, generally, be blorby (ior hippified). The 90s games culture is still very strongly rooted, very defensive.<br/><br/>But it had the opposite effect. I honestly believe the traditional GM/PC split kind of needs blorb in order to really shine. I do. And if that notion can become more widespread, maybe I can finally play again and not have to GM all the time. I'm so scared that blorby play will die with me.                        </div>

                            I appreciate your model, and I admire your dedication to it.  The only flak I give you is for the categorical nature of your assertions on games you are not involved with.<br/><br/>You may recall my old thread "I want to be a machine," in which you participated in a similar negative way (roles reversed).  And while I admit that I began the thread by making categorical assertions myself, by the time we'd reached page 2 or 3 I'd corrected my statements to make it clear that I was only speaking of my own personal approach, for any who might wish to adhere to it.  It became an explication of a personal praxis, rather than a universal value judgment.<br/><br/>That's what I'm advising for you, both here and in the other threads.<br/><br/>As for the death of blorby play, well, I've already talked about how I used to run D&amp;D in a very blorby way.  My feeling is that my preference for--and ability to dedicate my time to--blorby play is directly and inversely related to the age of my oldest child.<br/><br/>It turns out--for both myself and my players--that it wasn't sorely missed.                        </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">The specific way I've tried to achieve blorb so far definitely isn't perfect or perfectly satisfying <i>especially</i> when it comes to other concerns.<br/><br/>But let's examine <i>un</i>blorb. Frank &amp; plain &amp; blatant unblorb. What are some examples?<br/><br/>What's the core gameplay loop of unblorb?<br/><br/><i>Unmoderated, unilateral insertion or manipulation of game state entities.</i><br/><br/>By one person: the GM. That's ultimately what we're looking at when we're looking at unblorb (or antiblorb, which is "unblorb presented as if it were blorb"—but let's stick to examining unblorb for now, that's enough of a can of worm).</blockquote>
Well, that's not exactly how it is. Blorb games have tier 3 truths, which sort of erode a bit the feeling of realness, so they're not pure in their blorbiness. Some unblorby games might have a solid game state, just because of a long time playing together that campaign. So for me at least there's no hard line to draw between both, and even blorb games require a process to acquire those techniques, so they might transition from an unreal initial state, to a more real later one.<br/>To label some gaming style as bad, we'd need a pretty clear dynamic that's harming people, and problematic gaming should be easily recognised, when contrasted to fine gaming. The line that separates blorb from unblorb seems to me a bit blurry.                        </div>

                            No need to be so dramatic.  I'm just saying that in that vast virtual field of possible ways to play, blorbiness is but one spectrum among many, and that the determined value of one or another playstyle is relative to both players and GMs in ways that <i>must</i> consider those other dimensions as equally (or potentially even more) important.  As the demands of being the sole breadwinner in a growing family increased over time, my choice was to either begin valuing those other dimensions, changing my approach to GMing, devising different types of systems, and finding players with similar values, or to put gaming away in the box labeled "childish things" and quit doing it altogether.<br/><br/><b>Note</b> that I'm <i>not</i> saying blorby play is childish, nor am I calling you a child.  We all have such a box, and we all put different things in it.  I'm talking about mine.  There are plenty things in that box I still love dearly and would love to pull out again, but on the other hand there's life, which has its own plans and often forces one to change one's priorities. Raising kids is a <i>huge</i> factor in this regard.<br/><br/>I also stopped reading massive book series and refined my taste for short stories. Clearly, that <i>doesn't</i> mean that all writers of massive book series suddenly became "bad" or "childish."  But <i>neither</i> does it mean I have settled for something of less value.<br/><br/>It just means that my view now contains other qualia that need to be considered--such as emotional affect, narrative structure, session length, cognitive load, and personal time, to name some easy examples--and that everything is relative.<br/><br/> </div>

Our GM periodically circles the table and whacks any appreciably inattentive player with the Stick of Awareness like some Rinzai Zen master, and gosh darn it we like it that way thank you very much!<br/><br/>Even if I agree with you probably like 99.5%, there's a part of me that thinks <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2012/01/11/the-way-forward" rel="nofollow">rolling mouse skulls or running an erotically charged sexventure</a> sounds fucking awesome, even if they're not things I can see myself ever enjoying the way that they do. I'm all the more fascinated by the people who make things I think are awful <i>work</i>, because how they manage to do it often reveals something about games that I'd never thought about before.                        </div>

                            AsIf I'm dramatic because I'm sick. And it has made me think that all of this is going to be gone.<br/><br/>yukamichi.<br/><br/>Right… but drinking Simple Green can be dangerous. I wouldn't make a general recommendation to use that in combination with ayahuasca.<br/><br/>I'll get back to one of the core dysfunctions of blorb. Maybe old Forge heads will get a kick out of this:<br/><br/>In a traditional 90s game the player is tied up with a bunch of rules and restrictions for what they can do, both in character creation mode and the playing-the-game mode.<br/>The GM otoh just gets a bunch of peppy advice, sometimes advocating straight up unblorby or antiblorby actions. The thesis is that this is a dysfunctional power imbalance. So there are two ways out of that bind. One is to hippiefy. Let the player loose! The other is to blorbify. Tie the GM up the same way the players are tied up.<br/><br/>The purpose of this isn't primarily fairness but the idea that interacting with entities is more engaging ("tangible") when they haven't been arbitrarily injected or manipulated. I.e. when they are part of the game state and not just smoke &amp; mirrors.<br/>Obv blorb vs unblorb is kind of a non-issue when it comes to a tight chamber drama where there <i>are</i> pretty much no entities except the PCs themselves.                        </div>

I admire what you do, love blorb techniques, and participate with eagerness in all these threads because this stuff is AWESOME.<br/><br/>Saying, "here are some cool techniques and they are really fun!" is a great way to start a conversation.<br/><br/>However, if you want to start a thread entitled "the dysfunction of unblorb", we all come eagerly awaiting some explanation of description.

Don't misinterpret this as hatred! It's quite the opposite:<br/><br/>It's people saying, "ok, you've made your claim. Now explain it! Tell us more!"<br/><br/>Where's the dysfunction you're describing?<br/><br/>It's eagerness and curiosity. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What I would like to hear:<br/><br/>* An explanation of why unblorby play is dysfunctional or "bad". Who is hurt, upset, or having their fun ruined?<br/><br/>* Is this *always* the case in unblorby play, as you are suggesting, or are there exceptions?<br/><br/>* What is an example of unblorb play that led to some real, interpersonal problems?<br/><br/>For instance, if we take your example of "hitting people at the table", it's easy to see how it could go wrong: someone could get hurt. How does one get "hurt" in unblorb play?<br/><br/>* Finally, how is this kind of hurt or dysfunction unavoidable in unblorb play?                        </div>

                            Again, it's all about the way you put it.  I'm absolutely sure that many MANY people would download a book on "How To Blorbify Your Game" - and some percentage of them would use some percentage of that information to positive effect.  A few of them would go whole-hog and run their games in a 100% blorby way, from then until eternity.<br/><br/>But to make categorical statements about a continually-changing field of endeavor with tons of creative angles, potential levels of focus, styles of use, and design intentions - and to do it in a place that assigns positive value to things like "hippy" design and "narrativist" mechanics - is to court antagony.<br/><br/> </div>

That's not my message at all.  I'm amazed in an envious way at the traction you've attained with this line of thinking, and I don't judge you negatively in any way.  I told you, I am an eclecticist.  I think everyone can learn something from everyone.<br/><br/>As for belonging...  I believe you've been at SG longer than I have - because I remember not knowing you but recognizing your posts and taking you as a significant figure in this new place I was trying to assimilate into - so if anything, you belong here more than I do.<br/><br/>I never said, nor meant to imply, that SG is not the place for blorby stuff.  And I've even told you that I welcome blorby stuff at fictioneers.net as well.  It is only and <i>only</i> and ONLY your <i>mode of assertion</i> that I rankle at, and because I'm not the only one who feels this way, you feel mobbed and perceive it as griefing.<br/><br/>But it isn't.<br/><br/>It's just a reminder that relativism is real.  <br/><br/>We love you, Sandra.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

Well that's not 100% true. Many games that you've labeled as unblorb have pretty decent principles to make up content/rulings on the spot. Apocalypse World has them, Burning Wheel has them, even Blades in the Dark to a certain extent. So, unmoderated, they're not.<br/><br/>Even if you tell me tier 3 is just following a rule, that rule lets the GM inject or manipulate the game state. Principles in AW are also rules. Otherwise the whole blorb issue would be solved by inserting a rule in every rulebook allowing the GM to make up stuff when there's nothing else available. I don't think that's the spirit of the theory you're developing.</blockquote> </div>

                            In case you you were going to say "aren't solutions", Paper→Rock is a general solution to chasm width that you can apply to all kinds of trad games to make them more blorby, because while prepping, you have the goal to make chasm widths that are interesting&amp;relevant for a wide variety of characters. Overly long or overly short chasm widths aren't interesting. Then, while running, switch agenda from "interesting &amp; relevant" to "just stick to the gloracle".<br/><br/>But other games can have specialized solutions that are even better solutions than Paper→Rock and thus do not need Paper→Rock.                        </div>

                            And "wallpaper into salience" is a misstatement. (Maybe a misstatement <i>I</i> made the other day but still.)<br/>The idea is that wallpaper is something that isn't really subject to the chasm width problem since it's not an input or prerequisite for any outcome or consequence in the blorb. Iff it becomes salient, you can no longer treat it as wallpaper.                        </div>

But there's that blasted binary again!  The <i>vast majority</i> of designable playspace is what you call unblorby, and always will be.  In fact it will continue to expand as long as there are humans creating ways to do things we haven't yet thought of with living fiction.<br/><br/>On the design level, that's because artists are artists, and will always find ways to blur or tweak or slice existing ideas along newly-appreciated lines of difference.  There's a million ways to cut a chicken that don't glean the main portion of their satisfying value from, say, "only cutting in parallel slices 30-degrees offset from the spinal column."<br/><br/>Maybe some of my cuts are blorby and others aren't.  Maybe I cut it differently on different nights, and for different reasons.  But it's still 100% of a whole chicken.  And as long as everyone at the table thinks it's yummy, then it's yummy.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I really hope you can believe us when we say that we love you. I mean that with 100% sincerity. <br/><br/>I've been sad that I've rankled you and that you haven't written to continue our email conversation. I've been sad that you want to leave. I've tried to talk you into coming over to Fictioneers to continue the conversation there.<br/><br/>You have been the most interesting and unique voice at Story Games lately, and that's something that I hope will continue somewhere else when this place shuts down.<br/><br/>Here are some quotes just from this tiny little short thread, alone, never mind all the other positive engagement you've had elsewhere!
<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>I like the Blorb principles</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote">I love blorb principles [...] I would be quite happy to apply them strictly, and have done so a fair bit in my long-ago gaming history.<br/></blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote"><br/><b>Note</b> that I'm <i>not</i> saying blorby play is childish, nor am I calling you a child.  We all have such a box, and we all put different things in it.  I'm talking about mine.  There are plenty things in that box I still love dearly and would love to pull out again</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>I agree with you probably like 99.5%</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote">I admire what you do, love blorb techniques, and participate with eagerness in all these threads because this stuff is AWESOME.<br/></blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote"> I'm absolutely sure that many MANY people would download a book on "How To Blorbify Your Game" - and some percentage of them would use some percentage of that information to positive effect.  A few of them would go whole-hog and run their games in a 100% blorby way, from then until eternity.<br/></blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote">I'm amazed in an envious way at the traction you've attained with this line of thinking, and I don't judge you negatively in any way. <br/><br/>[...]<br/> <br/>We love you, Sandra.<br/></blockquote>
In addition, I think that:<br/><br/>1. "How to Blorbify Your Game" or "Powered by the Blorb" would be an amazing product/line of thinking/document, and I would support it in every way I could.<br/><br/>2. You don't need to worry that blorb will ever die! I, for one, will carry on its torch wherever I go.<br/><br/>Eero has talked here about blorb (in his own terms), as have all the people who interacted with him. So do many/most OSR people, and the OSR movement is HUGE these days.<br/><br/>It's not going anywhere! It's a great part of gaming that needs to be celebrated. And you are a great part of Story Games that we continue to celebrate, or we wouldn't be here in these threads, interacting with you.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> <br/><br/>This stuff gets so complicated to talk about properly it gives me analysis paralysis. So this is going to be rough as fuck.<br/><br/>Let me rephrase what I mean. ‘I’m far less hygienic about rock/paper than you are’ and given the type of games we run that makes sense. I actively embrace wallpaper becoming salient so I don’t need tech to stop it happening. Although I do still need to be hygienic about it because it has to ‘start’ as wallpaper. I’d delight in the players using the tar I chose as wall covering to defeat the boss later. As long as I’m not deciding the tar is wall covering ‘because’ it could be used to defeat the boss.<br/><br/>As for tangibility. <br/><br/>Let’s say we’ve already prepared a situation + characters. The advantages of me of being very clear about entity introduction (through prep or whatever) are...<br/><br/>1) I get to play the fiction rather than the tension. I don’t have to think about making it interesting or good, I can just let the clockwork unwind.<br/><br/>2) The emergence is more impartial. Even with the best of intentions I can subtly railroad, strong prep prevents this.<br/><br/>3) Everybody is looking to resolve the situation rather than expand it. <br/><br/>So I’m not sure how much tangibility plays into it. I think 3 is ultra important to me and might be my version of tangibility but at this point my brain is getting fried.                        </div>

Right!<br/><br/>I actually agree that much/most of trad gaming could and would benefit from blorb techniques. I certainly use them when I run trad games! (Including "hardcore blorb" if I'm doing OSR-style gaming.)<br/><br/>However, the boundaries are blurry and sometimes it's not clear which side of the line things fall on. Sometimes hybrid forms produce great results.<br/><br/>Let's look at this:
<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>In a traditional 90s game the player is tied up with a bunch of rules and restrictions for what they can do, both in character creation mode and the playing-the-game mode.<br/>The GM otoh just gets a bunch of peppy advice, sometimes advocating straight up unblorby or antiblorby actions. The thesis is that this is a dysfunctional power imbalance. So there are two ways out of that bind. One is to hippiefy. Let the player loose! The other is to blorbify. Tie the GM up the same way the players are tied up.<br/><br/>The purpose of this isn't primarily fairness but the idea that interacting with entities is more engaging ("tangible") when they haven't been arbitrarily injected or manipulated. I.e. when they are part of the game state and not just smoke &amp; mirrors.<br/></blockquote>
Yes! 100%.<br/><br/>Story gamers and Forge-heads have been going on and on about this for a long time.<br/><br/>You might find it interesting to know (or maybe you already know?) that when Vincent published <i>Apocalypse World</i>, he got a lot of flak from other story gamers about this very design feature. "This game gives the GM too much power! Where are the limitations on the GM? Where are the game structures that control the GM's role from taking over the game?"<br/><br/><i>Apocalypse World</i> is/was a very surprisingly traditional game, even compared to Vincent's earlier designs, and it was coming out at the same time as games like <i>Archipelago</i> and <i>Fiasco</i>.<br/><br/>While some people still find it too "traditional" for their tastes, it seems to have stood the "real world test": the guidance in the book, the thorough explanation of Agenda and Principles, and the design features which guide the game in more player-driven ways seem to have worked for a LOT of people. The game has been tremendously popular and has generated - for many - their favourite roleplaying experiences.<br/><br/>But, yeah, he faced all these criticisms. And I don't think they're invalid! <i>Apocalypse World</i> is about as close to that "dysfunctional power imbalance" line as I will dare tread, unless it's with people I really like and trust.<br/><i><br/>A reference, if you're curious:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21327/how-much-power-does-the-gm-have-in-powered-by-the-apocalypse-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21327/how-much-power-does-the-gm-have-in-powered-by-the-apocalypse-games</a></i><br/><br/>I think you're absolutely right about this being dangerous design territory.<br/><br/>However, the fact remains that some groups really *like* having a strong, auteur GM who takes control of the game, and have a great time with it. <br/><br/>For example, I don't like railroaded traditional GMed play, as a rule. But we've discussed it a bunch with David_Berg, and I've told him that if he wants to run a railroaded game for me sometime, I'm down to try it. It would be a fun thing to experience, especially given the context of all the things we've discussed over the years.<br/><br/>If we actually did sit down and knowingly and willingly put that experiment into practice, would it be fair to call our play "dysfunctional"? <br/><br/>(It's not as hypothetical as it would seem, by the way, since we played a whole Sorcerer mini-campaign recently, and that game is definitely at least 90% traditional in terms of mechanics and it is entirely unblorby. And we had a great time!)
<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>Obv blorb vs unblorb is kind of a non-issue when it comes to a tight chamber drama where there <i>are</i> pretty much no entities except the PCs themselves.</blockquote>
Also true! Agreed.<br/><br/>Doesn't this kind of exception cause a problem for your thesis, though? I can run a "tight chamber drama" and play it in a traditional style, no problem. And I think it could be very fun! (Think of Braunstein games and <i>Paranoia</i>, for example.)                        </div>

Something like: The chasm width problem is an actual issue in game design and games that deal with it are superior to ones that don’t.<br/><br/>I’d even go so far as to say she’s maybe right about (weak version) ‘if you haven’t solved chasm width, then you’re better off with a Hippy game than something more trad like.’<br/><br/>Unfortunately the only good way of doing this is what <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>  suggested and looking at it on a game by game basis.

Also I’m lazy. <br/><br/>The other issue is that I don’t fully agree with Sandra. Chasm width is a problem. Rock/paper and wallpaper into salience aren’t.

With a clear shared agenda ‘some’ of those problems would go away.</blockquote>
Thanks, AlexanderWhite!<br/><br/>I agree with all of the above - both with you and with Sandra. I think Sandra's dead on about "the chasm width problem", and I also would sign off (with caveats) on the following:
<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>(weak version) ‘if you haven’t solved chasm width, then you’re better off with a Hippy game than something more trad like.’</blockquote>
Sandra, I would love to see talk to you about <i>Dogs.</i> It's a really interesting game that mixes traditional and non-traditional elements. So far, my impression is that it plays best with a mix of blorb and unblorb: blorby Town creation/prep, some intentional unblorby mixing in of character issues and Relationships, and entirely unblorby (but principled) mechanical solutions, like basing opposition dice on the number of Dogs participating in a conflict.<br/><br/>I've tried a variety of approaches to all these things, and that's where I've landed so far. I'm open to other thoughts and ideas, but, unfortunately, it seems like no one around here has bitten the bait!<br/><br/>Sandra, if you want to talk about an unblorby, traditional game that's not <i>Critical Role</i> or the <i>Spicy Dice Middle Earth</i> game, we can chat about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22140/ap-prepping-for-dogs-in-the-vineyard-and-blorb-narrativism-and-game-state" rel="nofollow">my Dogs game</a> or my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22155/we-finally-play-my-life-with-master-after-game-report" rel="nofollow">My Life with Master game</a>. Neither is as purely traditional as those other examples, but I'm happy to talk about any aspect of either game!                        </div>

Yes. This.<br/><br/>This is why <i>Apocalypse World</i> works for people. This is why <i>Burning Wheel</i> works for people. This is why <i>Sorcerer</i> works for people. <br/><br/>Have a "clear shared agenda", and you'll cut through problems. Blorb techniques are fabulous for enabling a certain particular and specific playstyle, but I would never have understood when and how to use them without a clear sense of creative agenda - that, in my experience, is what makes it all work.<br/><br/>They need to go together, in my experience - omit either element, and you're just spinning your wheels.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">However, the fact remains that some groups really <em>like</em> having a strong, auteur GM who takes control of the game, and have a great time with it.</blockquote>Kyriarchal structures comes into play here as well.

My worst experiences pre-blorb where when we were engaging with external entities like mysteries to solve, enemies to fight, treasure chest contents to discover. Because I saw it as all smoke and mirrors (I had no idea that they could be blorby).<br/><br/>As far as Dogs and Sorcerer go, I <em>have</em> talked extensively about them in these threads.

Well, you'll have to explain that one! Because I have no idea why.<br/><br/>(And as for Dogs, I have no idea what you mean. Also, I really doubt Vincent would be upset in any way by our discussing possible prep techniques for the game. I understand he's not happy with the way Native Americans are portrayed in the text, and I respect that, but it has nothing to do with a 'blorb' conversation.)<br/><br/> </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">I’d delight in the players using the tar I chose as wall covering to defeat the boss later. As long as I’m not deciding the tar is wall covering ‘because’ it could be used to defeat the boss.</blockquote>My own play group have sometimes expressed dissatisfaction with that. The tar example ended up not being that bad but at another time I had wallpapered a weird property to a building, sort of a weird time altering liquid and they started playing around with it and I was like “oh God I accidentally steam dragon”…<br/></blockquote>
That's a really illustrative example! I can definitely see how that improvisation might mess with your sense of "blorbiness". (And I've had the same experience, too!) I wonder if the players felt the same way about it?<br/> </div>

Recently, I've taken to breaking kayfabe sometimes. If I see them going down this route, I say "well, the prep just says 'wall'" and they've been appreciative. They don't want to miss salient clues.                        </div>

                            You don't fire up the holodeck just to have the participants sit around the virtual campfire and virtually listen to a virtual yarn is what I'm saying.<br/><br/>Hippie designs are designed around narration as the primary ludeme. We all can influence the story because the game is designed to produce story and care about story. Now, that said, I've never met a hippy game I truly loved. It's often a frustrating affair where our ideas collide in a way that's dissatisfying to both. The best hippie games do have some sorta role division, roles that are designed to interact meaningfully.<br/><br/>Blorby designs are designed around interacting with entities as the primary ludeme.

Now, that said, I've never met a hippy game I truly loved. It's often a frustrating affair where our ideas collide in a way that's dissatisfying to both. The best hippie games do have some sorta role division, roles that are designed to interact meaningfully.</blockquote>
Kagematsu is about making the eponymous knight-errant give me love points and how to go about that/deciding who merits love or pity. It's not about narrating anything.<br/><br/>Dog Eat Dog is about my interactions with the very much existing occupation of the island. Not about doing anything with any story.<br/><br/>Remember Tomorrow has existing factions setting the terms I play my character on. Certainly not designed around narration. It is about what factions do and what characters can do.<br/><br/>This isn't meant to question the uniqueness of your techniques or to encroach on interacting with a real world but "Hippie designs are designed around narration" is such an irritatingly boring OSR staple.                        </div>

<blockquote>Because it's reperfoming kyriarchy and privilege.</blockquote>
I'd argue a blorby GM enjoys too some of these privileges. Even if players are allowed to inspect his prep material afterwards, it's kind of a corrective action that comes <i>after </i>the session, after they had any chance to fix what might have been broken.<br/>The GM is also the only one capable to slip into author mode when doing prep and make up stuff for the campaign. In my mind, it's kind of irrelevant if that privilege comes during the sessions or when prepping. If a blorby GM told me there's a living unicorn inside the treasure chest (or whatever other nonsense), it wouldn't change the situation to see that he really wrote that nonsense 5 days ago while prepping.<br/>Actually, games like AW or BW let players have an input into how their world is and where to take the campaign to.<br/>If anything, the whole GM-with-players gaming style is problematic, not just unblorb trad gaming.                        </div>

No. It has the properties I first told them. But when I can tell they're going to spend 4 hours examining those properties in detail it's been good to let them know which properties were improvised. It depends on the context and what the campaign is and how invested they are in a particular goal or McGuffin. For some contexts futzing around with the wallpaper for 4 hours is just fine and dandy.

Ok, that sounds a bit like stretching what "prep together" is, but I'll accept it. In any case, not to get entangled in the specifics of how x or y does prep, is there any reason why this "prep together" quality of blorb hasn't been mentioned until this point*? Is it a prerequisite to do blorb, or only optional? I think this topic deserves to be expanded.<br/><br/>*Perhaps it has, I haven't read all the threads on the topic.                        </div>

Doesn’t sound that bad to me. When I think of functional gaming I split it 80% - people, 20% - system. I’d prefer unblorby hell-scape with you, than say pristine blorb with Chris Perkins.                        </div>

Classic Traveller talks like that, too. "The scenario resembles a science-fiction novel, in that some basic goal or purpose is stated, and the adventure occurs as the group strives to achieve the goal." This has been replaced today by the language of film (scene, episode) which is actually quite ridiculous in RT since it otherwise praises 80s Cyberpunk literature.<br/><br/>Compared to CT, RT has different units of play, but clearly both are roleplaying games and far from any kind of communal storyboarding/story creation.<br/><br/>And so the core terms I use when playing are:<br/>character (creation), conditions, introduction, deal, face off, exit. Stuff that I do, not write.<br/><br/>Factions setting the terms btw is p. 37: "Or you can cut a Deal if you really want to go up 'against' a Faction on your terms."                        </div>

Maybe.  I understand why you find blorb so ultimate.  You wish to guard against these - umm - would the right word be "tendencies"?  Fair enough.  But not everyone feels such a great urge to do so, or to it so "hygienically" (one might even say compulsively).  I'm an enabler for my Players and the stories that emerge from their actions, not an adversary. I certainly don't ever fear that I'd put anyone through anything they'd actually consider a hellscape, because... well, because I'm simply not that kind of person.<br/><br/> </div>

Ah, I see what you mean. That hadn't occurred to me, because I didn't even really *know* about that power imbalance in your group until this conversation. (I'm actually quite surprised, since the impression I get from all our previous conversations is that you rule your game and your group with an iron fist - playing "gotcha" with them, imposing constant rules changes, applications of rules which "punish" the players, and so forth. I'm quite fond of house rules myself, in comparison, and I've had some players simply demand that we play the game as written, so you seem to be ahead of me on that count, if that makes sense.)<br/><br/>From where I'm sitting, I'd be just as happy to allow you to run unblorbily as I would David, if you made a pitch for it (although I probably wouldn't after you describe that possible game as an "unending hellscape" for me! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> ).                        </div>

                            Thinking about it a little further:<br/><br/>* Your long history of running unblorby games suggests to me that you definitely DO have the social authority to do so.

                            Ugh this thread became “2097 inquisition” edition overnight. Not into it!<br/><br/>I spent a long time in terms of <em>years</em> with unblorby play but we’re talking maybe six sessions a year (and so difficult to find even one or two people who would play) compared to multiple sessions per week with blorby play where they voluntarily schedule sessions and drag me out of bed to run for them.<br/><br/>Those long years I was engaged in the hobby, reading books, reading threads, playing as often as I could.

He did it between sessions but in direct contrast to the “No paper after seeing rock” rule; he was frustrated that no-one was dying in his 5e game (compared to Lab Lord and Lamentations which I had been playing with him as DM). And I’m like … what!? I’ve never done that! If “combat balance” is off then the game is poorly design. I’ve never had any problems. Lethality isn’t a goal in and of itself.<br/><br/>The OSR is such a mash up of various principles. The Principia Apocrypha booklet has some blorby stuff and some unblorby stuff.<br/><br/>But obviously blorb (what I would later come to refer to as blorb) was to me the appeal of OSR play and the (for me) defining feature, much more so than “rulings not rules” or gonzo gore fests.<br/>Suddenly the game was real.<br/><br/> </div>

                            I think we need to take a step back and see what led us here. <br/><br/>Pre Forge games was a mess. We knew how to play them but then Ron pointed out that maybe they didnt do what we thought they did. So we started to design new kinds of games.  But after awhile we returned to those pre Forge games. Sometimes via OSR and sometimes implementing the new ideas in new games (but still basicly pre Forge ones). <br/><br/>And the murky incoherency was still there! This time Sandra showed us a new way. "Guys, we could try to go <i>this way</i> instead". <br/><br/>And it makes perfect sense! Of course! How come we didnt see this before? How come games in the early 80s didnt go this way? Well, to some extent they did but then they drifted far away and...well, became incoherent and led to dysfunctional play. <br/><br/>I really hope we all see blorb for what it is. This is huge! <br/><br/>Btw I dont write here a lot. Its been like 10 years since my last visit. I have however talked a lot with Sandra over at the swedish rpg forum so I have a good understanding when it comes to blorb. Howevere, I dont play or appreciate OSR very much, but I can see how the blorb can improve my own games/gaming. And Im thrilled! <br/><br/> </div>

"Patch and codify" is a fallback; ideally, you use a rule; if one does not exist, make a ruling and a develop a rule if it seems the occasion will repeat.<br/><br/>"Rulings not rules" allows anything from having a very simple skeleton of rules that you (the referee by themselves or the entire group by group consensus) build upon on the moment as seems appropriate, to assuming that every ruling is henceforth a rule. With the latter approach, the rules/rulings might or might not be written down, but my impression is that they usually live in memory, aside from tables and such which are often written down.<br/><br/>One end of the "rulings not rules" spectrum is quite close to blorby practices, or maybe even there, though I would say that there is a philosophical difference even then: Whether coming up with rulings on the moment is a good and welcome part of play, or something one should, for the most part, avoid.<br/><br/>The other end of "rulings not rules" is quite far from blorb.<br/><br/>My personal view is that this is not a deep issue, but rather different solutions to the same problem. In a convention game, in sporadic online play with strangers, or with a shifting or casual group of players, going full blorb might be less ideal than when playing with a fairly stable group, especially if there are plenty of player-facing rules and procedures that are codified as rules. Hardcore blorb also assumes an effective means of saving and retrieving information.<br/><br/>The benefits of blorb involve less negotiation about rules during play (since the ruling has already been made and codified, after some play at least) and, at least for some people, a more solid and objective fictional reality. Depending on details, hardcore blorb might also allow elaborate rules-level play (character optimization, using clever interactions between the rules to advantage in play), should the group enjoy such, whereas "rulings not rules" is quite incompatible with those.                        </div>

                            This is a useful distinction. Is there a famous "high investment / beer and pretzel" scale of frameworks and techniques for RPG ?                        </div>

                            The word "ruling" by some referees mean "one time use my best take on the situation the way I was feeling it then and there and the next time something similar comes up I might say something differently" and by some referees mean "gap patching". The fact that the phrase continues "not rules" obv makes me think the orig intent by whomever coined the phrase was the former, whereas I'm more into the latter.<br/><br/>It's in the Old School Primer btw, page 2. I'm just not into it. I'm into rules that have diegetic input which isn't the same thing as constantly creating new rulings.                        </div>

                            Right. It depends on the priorities of the group and the fluency with which they can apply “patching” to the game.<br/><br/>I’ve seen “rulings, not rules” applied, in practice, as a way to enable one person’s whims (usually the GM), and I’ve seen it as a process the whole group engages in order to better leverage the gloracle. When the whole group is committed to using it that way, it can be very effective, whether to build up a stable rule set over time or as a means of mechanical bricolage with the shared goal of better serving the gloracle and removing individual whims from the resolution process.                        </div>

                            It strikes me now that klockverk is chronological. You can't break logic to find out what just happened. Which would indeed be a dysfunction, but a valuable one, as in "creative glitch".                         </div>
