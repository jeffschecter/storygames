It's a storytelling game about amnesiacs that sits somewhere between 1001 Nights, Puppetland, and Lacuna. It designed for three to six people and should be playable in single sitting. I'll be playtesting it with my group tonight, but I'd love to get some other perspectives on it. If you're interested, I can send you the current draft.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>--Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
