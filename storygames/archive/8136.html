It\u2019s been quite the campaign. Currently, our story spans 23 years, four major characters, and a number of minor characters. Chapter Six saw some major character transformation, and I think that we will discover that it was a pivotal moment in the campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe campaign had humble beginnings. Originally, it started as a one-shot at the summer Go Play Peoria minicon. I had really wanted to squeeze in two Chapters, but we started late in the day and could only complete the one Chapter. It was a great Chapter, though, full of lots of fun color. We had Zahir, the arrogant strategist; William, the power-grabbing governor; and General Valkyr, who is really a woman, defending the town of Ninshi against Molly the Pirate Queen. Some notable moments include when Zahir was suavely trying to woo General Valkyr, as he was aware of her identity, and when Molly, her back to the sea, hacked off the head of a mutinous captain and, holding it aloft, charged the defending soldiers, howling her battle cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty much the kind of thing that you\u2019d expect from <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd eventually, the pirates were stopped, William was \u201cpromoted\u201d away from Ninshi, Molly was captured, and Zahir was left alone to woo Valkyr, having manipulated the entire situation to his advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian was playing Molly, and she topped the Owe List. He was from out-of-town, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to continue the game. However, he insisted on preparing the next Chapter as if we were going to continue playing. So he consulted the Oracles. He selected Blood and Sex and chose \u201cA happy girl, promised in marriage to a gentleman, naive to the danger he represents.\u201d Someone sitting at the table said, \u201cThat\u2019s Molly\u201d.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy head exploded.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the group insisted that we continue playing. So, we have now seen Molly as a young girl, na\xefve and charming, the prize in a contest between a fertility god and a sorcerer. We\u2019ve seen Molly in the years after the raid, now the Queen of Argonzed and mother of the heir, escaping the palace coup that took the life of her husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that\u2019s just one character. I haven\u2019t talked about the gradual emergence as Zahir as an unlikely protagonist, despite his manipulative ways, and the conflicted sorcerer, Kiragalzu, who is in league with the powers of darkness yet has truly loved Molly ever since she was young.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chronology rules are especially fun. In Chapter Six, we discovered that our world contains the Ashtari, a cult of sorceress-assassins. This means that Erishti, the murderer of the king, was part of this group. Why did the Ashtari want the king dead? I didn\u2019t even know this was a question until last Friday. Suddenly, all sorts of new possibilities present themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, those of you who are familiar with my normal Actual Play write-ups know that I usually include a lot more detail. But that\u2019s because I don\u2019t actually want to discuss our game <i>per se</i>. Instead, I\u2019d like to discuss emergent campaigns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a number of designs that are often pressed into service as one-shot games that were actually designed for <i>episodic</i> longer-form play. I\u2019m thinking here of <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, <i>Trollbabe</i>, <i>3:16</i>, and, of course, <i>In a Wicked Age</i>. (I also wonder if games like <i>Shock:</i> or my own <i>Legends of Alyria</i> and <i>Dirty Secrets</i>  would work well in this mode.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe distinguishing feature of these designs that I want to discuss is this long-term episodic play. Each of these games produce units of play that are self-contained but are not intended to remain self-contained. So, while you can play a single town of <i>Dogs</i>, you haven\u2019t really engaged the full depth of the game until you\u2019ve run several towns with the same characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, unlike games like <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, the games provide no formal campaign structure, nor are you really supposed to prep for a long campaign. Rather, the group simply repeats the episode structure until\u2026well\u2026until they\u2019ve had enough, I guess.  The campaign then emerges from play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to talk about. What are good techniques to employ in these emergent campaign games to develop the campaign aspect of these games? Sure, we\u2019ve gotten pretty good at developing Towns for <i>Dogs</i>, and I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll continue to develop our ability to create Planets for <i>3:16</i>. But what about techniques for the spaces in between? What about the stringing together of the episodes? How do you determine when to stop?<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ll cop to a great deal of self-interest in this area. I think that this is a fascinating area of RPG development, and my next big project probably will be designed in this vein. Plus, of course, I\u2019d like to consider how to play through our game of <i>In a Wicked Age</i> well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how do we do this sort of play well?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth Ben-Ezra<br/>\nGreat Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179121/#Comment_179121" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T09:09:48+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  9:09AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted a big response to this at the Forge thread of the same name                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179128/#Comment_179128" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T10:31:11+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 10:31AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2008 10:34AM by JDCorley.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first experience with that sort of glee arose out of the original episodic, repeated play: a campaign of seemingly unconnected D&amp;D modules, some not even in the same universe ("Hey, I got this cheap Dragonlance module, it's sort of in the middle of the plot, what the hell, let's do it anyway.")  I think a lot of kids my age with the red box experienced it that way.<br><br>When I started to fumble towards story as something I wanted, though, I leaned away from episodicness and towards ongoing-ness as a key factor, due to the fact that the fad, and my own tastes, ran to doorstop-sized fantasy novels. Episodic? Bah, if it lasts less than a year it's not worth playing! The fact that none of them lasted a year and I didn't notice I can only chalk up to my own dumb stupiddumbnessitude.  Although as I managed to get further down that road, there were certain things that I learned that were valuable for non-episodic play, such as soap opera tactics of when to introduce new plots and characters and when to resolve them.<br><br>These days I tend to run games that are more tightly planned and structured. Although there is some emergent stuff, it isn't really from player contributions (which my current group does not like to give) - it is from my own adaptations of existing material (in cases where it's not made up whole cloth) and my own extensive notes.  "Hey look, I completely forgot I wrote that down, and it could totally link in with this new thing I just made up."<br><br>I absolutely agree that IAWA is terrific for this. Primetime Adventures a little less so because the only thing that gets reincorporated is the actual player characters, the main ensemble.  I don't think it gives us much to work with on that score.  With IAWA, by contrast, the Owe List requires the incorporation of past elements.  That is a key point.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179129/#Comment_179129" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T10:46:51+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 10:46AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>there were certain things that I learned that were valuable for non-episodic play, such as soap opera tactics of when to introduce new plots and characters and when to resolve them.<br/></blockquote>\nJason,<br><br>I'd love to hear more about this.
