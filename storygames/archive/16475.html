From 2004 through 2009, I worked on developing and independently publishing my Game Chef game <a href="\u201dwww.ganakagok.com\u201d" rel="nofollow"><b>Ganakagok</b></a>. Prompted by the key words \u201cice,\u201d \u201cisland,\u201d and \u201cdawn,\u201d I wrote a game where the PCs were members of a tribe of hunters who lived on a frozen island in a world of eternal night where the stars were gods. Each game began at the same point, with the PCs facing an epochal change in their lives: Dawn was coming. The characters\u2019 actions would drive the response of their tribe to the imminent sunrise, with lasting consequences for the fate of the world, the people, and themselves.<br/><br/>With this as the high concept of the game, it seemed \u201cnatural\u201d to rely on some <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/resources/inuit-eskimo" rel="nofollow">Eskimo</a> cultural trappings.  These trappings served as a kind of shorthand for the setting and its tropes; what some larpers call the  \u201cinteraction codes\u201d (i.e., suites of shared meanings and referents; see <a href="http://jeepen.org/kpbook/kp-book-2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">Eirik Fatland\u2019s 2006 Knutepunkt article</a>) at work in a game. I instructed the GM to make sure that the players gave their characters names that were vaguely Inuit in sound\u2014\u201cprimitive and icy,\u201d I\u2019m ashamed to say, is a phrase I used.  In my defense, my intent was to <i>discourage</i> cartoonish characters by reminding the GM of the need to take the setting seriously and enforce coherence of character and setting. But it\u2019s possible to read that language and understand it as \u201cexotification\u201d of Eskimo culture, and I regret it. But I\u2019m not embarassed about references to Eskimo material culture (kayaks, harpoons, parkas, and so forth) that appear in the game, since I think they do help create a sense of the interaction codes driving play.<br/><br/>The game also relies for much of its force on a special deck of playing cards that have oracular meanings associated with them; the Ace of Spades, for example, is renamed the Ancient of Tears and associated with the image of a (polar) bear and the motif \u201cto overcome or master.\u201d These meanings come up in play and get incorporated into the fiction in really nifty ways. But in trying to design the deck cheaply and quickly, we used clip art and public domain imagery, some of which were drawn from Haida, Tlingit, and other native American cultures of the Pacific Northwest. I regret not being more sensitive to this particular act of appropriation, not because the imagery mixes and matches from more than one native American culture (since it wasn\u2019t important to me that the people of Ganakagok be regarded as a direct analog of some real-world culture), but because those images were not properly attributed to their originary cultures. Taking the images out of context and appropriating them into the game as if they were manifestations of the (purely imaginary) Nitu culture was artistically wrong, amounting to a very real plagiarism of setting material.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I wasn\u2019t attuned to these issues as issues until after I published the game and received some criticism along those lines, gently from  <a href="http://gamishdesigner.blogspot.com/2009/09/ganakagok-not-review.html" rel="nofollow">a friend</a> and more harshly by  a fellow named <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2009/11/06/primitive-and-icy" rel="nofollow">Chris Chinn</a>, who is a vocal on-line advocate for these issues. I thought about their comments and had a brief dialogue with Chris, which I discuss <a href="http://billwhite.blogspot.com/2009/11/ganakagok-and-cultural-appropriation.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In it, I conclude that my obligations are to encourage the support of native American and particularly Inuit artists, and to make clear the provenance of any native American imagery used in the game\u2019s materials. Other than mailing a check, I am ashamed to say that I haven\u2019t done much to fulfill those obligations recently, but I\u2019m aware of them as outstanding debts that will need to be addressed sooner rather than later if I want to think about a second edition of <b>Ganakagok</b>. The important point is that I needn\u2019t have suffered those criticisms if only I\u2019d been more sensitive to my ethical obligations as an RPG designer\u2014someone whose business it is to take bits and pieces of human culture and recombine them into playable forms. We are all bricoleurs, like it or not.<br/><br/>In any event, the experience of being called out for cultural appropriation has made me more cautious with my current project, <b>The New World</b>, undertaken in response to my friend Simon Rogers\u2019 desire for a game about colonization that permits role-playing and is not a Civilization-like strategy game while at the same time incorporating some sense of long-term consequentiality. <b>The New World</b> is similar to <b>Ganakagok</b> in many ways, and my experience of being charged with cultural appropriation has shaped my design goals. The concept of the game is rich enough that it doesn\u2019t need to rely on a particular tendentious or problematic understanding of human history. So I\u2019ve tried to broaden the diversity of references I use to underpin the game\u2019s oracular motifs (which inspire character backgrounds and in-game events), enabling the free play of participants\u2019 historical imaginations, and the game makes no presumptions about the PCs\u2019 sympathies with what it calls Native, Newcomer, and Outsider cultures, allowing individual cultural allegiances to shift and cultures themselves to change as a result of their encounters which each other. I am waiting for playtest comments and recognize the need for some procedural refinements, but conceptually the game does what I want it to do.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think talking about issues of cultural appropriation and intellectual property more generally is really worthwhile, particularly because of how role-playing games are fundamentally toys for playing with culture. Even if it can be painful to be called out on those grounds.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376992/#Comment_376992" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T13:56:25+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  1:56PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because I'm a problem-oriented thinker, I'm curious about whether you've thought of outside-the-box solutions to your Ganakagok conundrum.

But in thinking about a second edition, I want to acknowledge the possibility of Ganaka-hacking, so that the culture of the Nitu could be vaguely Norse (skalds! Vikings!) or vaguely Sami (skiing! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joik" rel="nofollow">joiking</a>!) as well. This is in addition to hacking the game into different settings entirely, like Nick Wedig's <i>Dark Crystal</i> hack or other ideas that have been floated about, like God-Emperor of Dune or Last Night on the Titanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan" title="Jonathan"><img alt="Jonathan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">Jonathan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377007/#Comment_377007" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T14:29:09+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  2:29PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, I've read this about three times now and I just have to say thank you three times for it.<br/><br/>You are an officer and a gentleman and I'm really looking forward to your new game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377010/#Comment_377010" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T14:33:03+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  2:33PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan</cite>Bill, I've read this about three times now and I just have to say thank you three times for it.</blockquote>\nQFT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377028/#Comment_377028" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T15:39:37+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  3:39PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Ultimately, I think talking about issues of cultural appropriation and intellectual property more generally is really worthwhile, particularly because of how role-playing games are fundamentally toys for playing with culture.

My ancestors walked the Trail of Tears. My family still contends with the consequences of both the original colonization and the subsequent and concurrent cultural genocide and appropriation. <br/><br/>I very much appreciate your sincere desire to do better. My perspective, which would be similar to many Native people's, is that you cannot be expected to be perfect, and you cannot be expected to never make any mistakes. You should be expected to listen to criticism, and be open to hearing when you have made a mistake. You should be expected to be expected to be respectful of other people's feelings. Being respectful is the best way of gaining the respect of people. <br/><br/>I have been in one previous discussion about culture and respect on this forum. The person who started that discussion never did listen to what I had to say. There was massive public outcry, and ultimately, I just let it go because there was no point. The private messages I got were at least as disrespectful as the public posts that caused such a stir. That person was not respectful. That person wanted validation for their "creativity", and was unable to listen to the fact that they were insensitive.<br/><br/>I would like to say that I have respect for you for approaching this subject with humility, and with an effort to listen. In the end, it is the duty of the offender to try to understand the hurt that the offended feels, and to make it right. As someone who has suffered offense, mostly what is needed by the offended is a sincere understanding and admission of the offense by the one who offended them. While I have not read your game, and I do not really understand the critique you are addressing, I think that it is admirable that you can publicly admit your mistake. I think it admirable that you have listened.<br/><br/>Thank you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377085/#Comment_377085" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T22:55:16+00:00" title="May  7, 2012 10:55PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Bill.

Is that better or worse?</blockquote>\nBetter or worse in what way? I suspect people are talking about a lot of different things here.<br/><br/>Here's how I see it:<br/><br/>Fantasy lays a gauzy veil across its cultural sources.  This is why euro-medieval-fantasy doesn't include very common terrible things about real European medieval times, say, virulent anti-Semitism. (Edit: Nobody freaks when that happens, though maybe we should.)<br/><br/>Hell, sometimes extremely central features of the real culture are flat erased (try to find a church in Middle Earth - you will have to hike a long way in.) <br/><br/>If you lay that veil across cultural sources that are <i>already being erased</i> in your audience's world - native cultures everywhere are a good example, then you're making the problem worse.<br/><br/>Superficiality is not necessarily a flaw in creating a fantasy world!  But it is, and especially damaging, when it is applied to things that the audience only has a superficial knowledge of anyway.<br/><br/>So the audience and context also matters.

After all if it wasn't "property" there'd be nothing to appropriate, and it certainly isn't physical property.  But just like there's a point at which the world as a whole is better off when the IP enters the public domain and can be used, reused, repurposed, reinvisioned, and reinvented without anyone being able to stop such by claiming of "ownership"; so cultural property should work the same way. <br/><br/>There's a point at which members of society have to simply accept that a culture has entered the public domain and they no longer have any ownership claim over it.<br/><br/>My current working notion for when that is, is the point at which no living person remains who had ever personally first hand met and spoken with an actual living member of that culture.  By living member of the culture I do not mean someone who has learned about or recreated or attempted to preserve the culture, I mean when the culture was a living culture that the person was born and raised in it.<br/><br/>To me, once a culture is no longer being actively practiced, and no one alive ever knew anyone who was alive when it was actively practiced then claims to having a stake in that culture are more wishful thinking than valid reality.<br/><br/>Since that's kind of a hard claim to measure...if you figure person A was born and raised in a culture until the age of 10 when the culture was effectively destroyed and then went on to live to 100.  And person B met person A when they were 10 and A was 90 and knew them and shared with them for the last 10 years of their life; and person B went on to live to 100...then doing the math backwards...180 years after the culture ceased to be an active living culture, it should be considered public domain, which here in 2012 would mean anything prior to 1832 should be considered fair game...placing Native North American Cultures near but not quite passed that point just yet...while American Slave Culture still has a good several decades to go...probably longer than many of us will be alive.<br/><br/>Thus, while one might take umbrage for historical authenticity reasons over certain portrayals of Rome or ancient Egypt, it would be IMO a fair stretch for modern Italians or Egyptians to claim any cultural ownership save happening to live on the same piece of ground.  Similarly umbrage over games like Victoriental can be seen because that period of pan-asian cultural history is still within the ownership window.  By contrast while I'd sympathize with someone disclaiming the historic accuracy of a portrayal of Ming or Yuan China, I'd be inclined to tell them to take a flying leap if claims were made regarding cultural appropriate.  Ming China now belongs to all of us...just like Rome and Egypt and Ancient Mesopotamia...and I'd say with respect to New Fire...Native Mesoamerican cultures which were all pretty much ravaged long before 1832.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377280/#Comment_377280" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T07:46:41+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  7:46AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, <br/><br/>To someone who can actually identify with a culture being appropriated, it's a lot less cut and dried.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377281/#Comment_377281" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T07:48:19+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  7:48AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph -- I'm traveling right now, so forgive my brevity.

The basic problem is that for many peoples, their own reality and culture is being drowned out by a much larger host of stereotyped views created by outsiders.  So this isn't an issue of "intellectual property" in my mind, in that as long as the more authentic cultural sources are being propagated, then imitations don't matter much.  <br/><br/>I think that these issues may still apply even if you are using a historical culture like Ming China or Mongolia under Genghis Khan.  The issue is that modern people's views are often strongly influenced by historical stereotypes.  For example, a modern-day American's view of Mongolia is likely to be driven more by generally fictional portrayals of Genghis Khan than anything else.  This is even true of China to a degree.  <br/><br/>Drawing from my own experience: <br/><br/>I don't think Korea suffers from cultural appropriation per se, but it does have a history of cultural marginalization.  When the Japanese invaded and occupied Korea (from 1909 to 1945), they had a very deliberate program to erase Korean culture.  My father grew up going to mandatory Japanese schools in the late 1930s, where students were forced to only speak in Japanese, learn only Japanese culture, and were taught propaganda that Korea was an offshoot of Japan.  While the modern relevance of this history is fading, it still annoys me to see the near omnipresence of Japanese cultural icons (ninja, samurai, etc.) while the deliberately erased Korean cultural icons remain largely unknown.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377328/#Comment_377328" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T12:24:23+00:00" title="May  9, 2012 12:24PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2012 1:29PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I find Ralph's formulation of historical culture attractive, and he does raise a good point about history being a "foreign country." The culture of Egypt in the time of King Tut is just as alien to your average 20th century Egyptian as it is to any 20th century American, and it would also be fairly ridiculous, for example, to accuse George R. R. Martin of appropriating French or English culture because he writes fantasy fiction inspired by medieval chivalry.<br/><br/>The problem I see is that it doesn't much account for historiography. Historical knowledge is not an abstract possession. It comes from somewhere, and it comes from someone. Some cultures preserve their own history, other cultures have been recovered in more recent times. Tutankhamun may be well more than 180 years gone, but our knowledge of him comes from a little over 180 years of "Egyptology" and archaeology in the Middle East.<br/><br/>As an extended example, let's say you sit down with the <i>Cantares Mexicanos</i>, in preparation to create your Aztec rpg. It seems pretty cut-an-dry, no? Those Aztecs are all gone.<br/><br/>And yet, there are modern speakers of Nahuatl. They don't make war to collect sacrifices for the old gods anymore, but they do continue to speak the same language as those people did. Granted, they will probably never read your game, but what would they think if they did?<br/><br/>Or to expand on Zac's comment, there are also (non-Nahuatl-speaking) Mexicans who are proud of their indigenous heritage, who are trying to preserve that history, and who feel some ownership over it. What if they think you are disrespecting what they consider their heritage? Would that concern be legitimate, and if not, how would you convince anyone that it isn't?<br/><br/>And what about the appropriation of other indigenous cultures? After all, you would probably be sitting down with J. Bierhorst's translation of the <i>Cantares Mexicanos</i>. Bierhorst portrayed these poems as ghost dances, by analogy with those of the Paiute Indians of the late 19th century, and has received quite a bit of criticism for this from other Aztec/Nahuatl specialists. Which raises the question: Is Bierhorst's interpretation legitimate, or does it constitute the appropriation of more recent indigenous culture, within that 180-year time frame?<br/><br/>In any case, that's just one example, and a long way of saying that knowledge about historical cultures reaches us through a process, and that process may, in some cases, be heavily influenced by recent politics and may even include cultural appropriation of its own. Further, each case is different. The distinction between what I think of as "dead history" and "living history" (the difference between whether anybody is still alive who was alive at the time) can be a perfectly legitimate way to draw a line between what is and isn't a cultural possession\u2014in some cases.<br/><br/>But every case is different. Ancient Egypt has reached us through a different set of scholars and cultural analogies and colonial infrastructures than Aztec history, both of which are different from those taken by, say, Imperial China or medieval England.<br/><br/>If there's one thing I've learned from studying historiography, it's that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">studying historiography ruins everything and drains your enthusiasm like some kind of horrible vampire</span> there are no universal metrics. Every piece of history has a different set of curators and a different relationship to people alive now, and that the distance between now and then isn't really a good indicator of what you can expect from those curators, or popular opinions. So, as much as I like the idea that the past, once it's been the past for a while, is something that belongs to all of us\u2014and while I agree that Ming China <i>should</i> belong to all of us, regardless of whether it <i>does</i> or not\u2014in practice I find it's just too complicated to get much use out of that position once actual research starts. At least, that's how it is for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377330/#Comment_377330" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T12:30:03+00:00" title="May  9, 2012 12:30PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, to put it another way: Bill's concerns over cultural appropriation involved "living cultures" of the present (Haida and Inuit).

Is it about them? Do people think it's about them? Are people saying your game is appropriating them? Is your game about "the Aztecs" or Bierhorst's interpretation of them? Should you learn Classical Nahuatl or do you just go to the Spanish translation? I mean, I don't know. How much should your game about Ancient Egypt be influenced by discrimination against native Egyptian Egyptologists? I don't know! I suppose I would expect you to figure out the answers for yourself (and for your game), but at the very least, I would say it's a good idea to find out who has a horse in the race before you go painting a picture of it.

Obviously, it's easier if you know other gamers or game designers who have a strong background and expertise in the area you're trying to write about. I'm not Chinese, but other game designers regularly email me to ask if one or another thing related to China or the Chinese language passes basic inspection, due to my 10+ years of background. Often they do, sometimes they don't, and sometimes I tell people that their question is outside my expertise and I offer suggestions of other places to look or people to contact. If it is possible to contact both knowledgable people and also folks who hail from the cultures you're writing about, definitely go for it; it can only improve your game.<br/><br/>In another of these conversations about appropriation, Graham expressed his interest in potentially working on a game about Harriet Tubman and the underground railroad but admitted that, as an Englishman from a different background, he was worried about some of the issues that might be involved. So he started a conversation with Julia (who's written a game about slavery in the United States and done a fairly immense amount of research on the subject, in addition to being African-American) about how he could approach that in a productive fashion. That's super awesome and has nothing to do with getting Julia's "approval" of anything he ultimately creates. It's not like Julia can speak for all black people, right? It's just about running your game by people who might be in a position to help you avoid potential problems, just like you would with potentially problematic mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377357/#Comment_377357" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T14:36:04+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  2:36PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2012 2:45PM by pigeon.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>Hmm.

A culture is not so simple.<br/><br/>I am Native. I have a culture that is actually very much far removed from what could be considered the norm, even in the US. My culture is alive and well. There are all of the aspects of traditional in my life, including every element that could be considered culture, from language, to music, to story, to dance, to art and artifice, to diet, to spirituality... My culture is not dead. Traditional can have various timelines. Something that lasts more than one generation has become a tradition, and many things do not take that long to become tradition. I do not need to go back 180 years to see traditional, and there are things that do not go back that far that are traditional. Your timeline has no real connection to living cultures.<br/><br/>Is my culture identical to the culture of my pre-colombian ancestors? Obviously not. But culture is like a tree. It starts as a seed, grows to a seedling, then a sapling, then a full grown tree, eventually dies and becomes a snag, and then a fallen log. At each point along this timeline, there is no doubt that it is the same tree, despite not being identical. At every point along this timeline, there is value. Just like the tree, there may come a point when taking part of the tree will not kill it. But there is no point when taking something will not change it. And when a culture or tree has had so much taken from it, so much insult in it's lifetime, you can understand when the culture or tree says "No more. The rest is mine to share as I like, but you have no right to just take." While the culture lives, you have no right to take from it. And only those who live the culture have a right to say if it is alive.<br/><br/>The other aspect of this conversation is that, for cultures outside of the norm, perceptions of the minority by the dominant culture are frequently inaccurate. The inaccuracies can be damaging. These inaccuracies often have far reaching historical roots, and far reaching contemporary consequences. I still meet people all the time who tell me how unfortunate that it is that Native people are so inclined to drinking, ignoring the fact that every culture with similar socioeconomics has similar rates of alcoholism, and that maybe the problem isn't race or culture, maybe it is poverty. When I have to think about how I will be seen when I drink a beer at a holiday party, just because of my ethnicity, then I feel the real effects of hurtful stereotyping. My culture is alive, but so are the inaccuracies held as truths by those outside my culture.<br/><br/>When you take aspects from living cultures, then reuse them for your own ends, be careful that you know what you are talking about. Be careful that you are not recombining hurtful stereotypes, or even romanticized stereotypes in your appropriations. Be careful that you are not being disrespectful.

I believe you are talking about me, and the thread I opened to ask for indian experiences some months back. It was part of my research for a fantasy-game I ran this winter. I asked about indians and their experiences in meetings with whites, and got some useful answers. It informed my game, and made it better.<br/><br/>But I got some shit too, shit that should leave a lot of participants in that thread shamed.<br/><br/>I remember you from the discussion. You, and others, reacted strongly to my premise; that I wanted to play humans conquering orcs, and searched for inspiration in how indians were treated. You <b>interpreted</b> this to be me "portraying indians as orcs". I told you this was not correct, several times, but to my chagrin most of you stopped listening to what I said early on in the thread, and made it your business to shout me down. <br/><br/>To see that a fair amount of you accepted that as a modus operandi, made me doubt if this forum is a place to discuss real issues at all. The refusal to read and heed what I stand for, the insensitive shouting, and the almost general acceptance of it, was a hurtful and bloody unfair experience! <br/><br/>I have to give thanks to the few sane voices in the thread, that I did not quit this forum altogether.<br/><br/>And now you drag it up again! As if you were a holy knight with no responsibility for what happened! You do not see that coming down on people like that, on grounds far from what they stand for, is bloody unfair and damaging. To read your underhanded message on it now, is both painful and sad.<br/><br/>I tried to respond to some of you in private back then, trying to explain what I stood for in those messages, with all the dignity and respect I could muster. To have you refer to those private messages, and characterize them as disrespectful, is both a breach of confidence, and totally wrong. You are so in the wrong here, Lee! I really regret having written anything to you now. Trying to explain myself to you was clearly a waste, and only something that made me even more of a "racist".<br/><br/>The whole experience was bloody hurtful. It made me doubt people in this forum. It made me sad for the hurt that so many people clearly had, and expressed in such a misguided manner. And to have it alluded to in this way, Lee, is a bloody provocative reopening of the wounds I had from that shouting contest.<br/><br/>Please let is rest.

Identify stakeholders.</b><br/>Find out who has a stake in the material you're interested in.<br/><br/><b>2. Address them.</b><br/>Figure out your own position on those stakeholder perspectives, and be prepared to enter into dialogue with them.<br/><br/>Jonathan's bullet points are a good list for staying respectful, and Liam (pigeon) and Lee (Nameless) also make good points about respect. What I'm saying that is unique in this discussion I guess is that, with historical subjects specifically, you need to <i>actually find out who you're supposed to be respectful towards</i>. And this takes work, too, because it's not as obvious as it is with living cultures, and there is no such thing as objective historical knowledge that can be accessed without reference to living people.<br/><br/>Oh, also, lemme clarify: I used the Victoriental example specifically because that dude was so obviously not prepared to address the offensive aspects of the word "oriental" in any respectful manner. It's not really about his feelings, it's like Liam says, because of his lack of due diligence, he ends up hurting other peoples' feelings and not having any way to correct that, because he thinks it's not on him.

Being accused of racism or appropriation can feel hurtful, certainly. But discussions of these kinds of issues easily get derailed by people defending themselves, talking about how hurt they feel, and no longer listening to each other. In fact, I'm worried that this side-discussion might now derail this thread (iconically, by talking about derailing). The only way these discussions can happen is if people take "accusations" (there has to be a better word than that) of racism, appropriation, and privilege seriously and are willing to listen and learn from people with different backgrounds. In fact, Bill began this thread attempting to talk about how that process went from him, going from a painful initial experience to learning and attempting to do better next time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377494/#Comment_377494" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T09:53:52+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  9:53AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 9:54AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Cross-posted with Jonathan here.)<br/><br/>I agree, Liam - not really topical here.

Really difficult to not defend yourself in public when you think that somebody or other would surely know what Nameless is talking about.

We see this a lot at any discussion forum where participants have unresolved disagreements: if some people decide to constantly affirm their viewpoint by dropping "Carthago delenda est" in unrelated discussions, the Carthagenans will surely come up and, indeed, "ruin" that discussion as well. The fault lies in both parties, although I'd be inclined to tell Cato to shut the fuck up or we'll never get to talk about anything with the Carthagenans - they can hardly let that pass, after all, if they're to pretend that they have any honor.<br/><br/>Was this roughly what you had in mind, Jonathan?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377499/#Comment_377499" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T10:04:42+00:00" title="May 10, 2012 10:04AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 10:16AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It occurs to me that discussion forums really should already move onto a new generation of technology. Can't be that difficult to create a compromise between the singly linear and freely branching modes we see in the Internet nowadays. Would help considerably with the very real discussion derailing concerns. Starting new threads is really a pretty poor substitute. For example, here it would be quite cool if we could just shunt this sideline somewhere without removing it from its context while also encouraging people to continue on the actual topic.<br/><br/>But yes, Jonathan I agree on the prescription of getting these interpersonal disagreements out to some other thread, although I wouldn't say that Tomas is really only or most at fault (see my Cathagenan simile, above). I'm confident that he's more than able to let discussion go on peacefully as long as he's not called out. The discourse standards can't work in a way where it's OK to snipe at people as long as you don't take too much thread space for it.<br/><br/>Anyway, I suggest we stop this topic derailment (unless Nameless or Tomas have something to add that's better dealt with here - I realize that I interfered there, as did Joe and Jonathan) and get back to reading about cultural appropriation. I myself have been reading this thread with interest, and if I haven't been writing much, it's exactly because I haven't felt like I'd have much to add that wouldn't just cause the discussion to derail again.

What are the stakes like in cultural appropriation, exactly, and who holds them? What kind of psychological, sociological and economic processes cause a person to become a stakeholder of culture? I'm intrigued because defining this thing clearly should enable us to see if similar stakesholding happens outside ethnic cultural situations. Also, it seems to me that Liam's concept of "hurting people" by cultural appropriation connects here - you get hurt by appropriation because you're a stakeholder of culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377525/#Comment_377525" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T10:46:06+00:00" title="May 10, 2012 10:46AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 10:46AM by Johnstone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the simple answer to the question "who is a stakeholder" is: whoever feels like they have a stake in it, and whoever says so. A slightly narrower definition would be anyone with experience or knowledge with the subject matter, and an even narrower definition would be the subject matter themselves. To be honest, I think it's a really obvious process identifying stakeholders with regards to living cultures, but maybe I'm just taking my perspective for granted? To me, it's the stakeholders of historical culture that are more difficult to identify, and actually, my two points are basically just what is considered proper in academic history nowadays (or the part of it I just spent a few years in, anyway).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377530/#Comment_377530" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T10:54:10+00:00" title="May 10, 2012 10:54AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it is that simple.

Disagreements are <i>awesome</i>: they tell you exactly what the thorniest, most problem-fraught issues are with your work, and how different audiences think you're handling those issues. Figuring out what to do to solve those problems is the hard part, obviously, and if your solution is "I'm going to ignore what those people are saying," you'd better have a really good, well-thought-out reason for doing so. (And these days, with so many different ways for authors to interact with their audiences, I would argue that you pretty much have to share that good, well-thought-out reason ASAP, or you're just throwing fuel on the fire.)<br/><br/>And sure, the author is a stakeholder, too. Being the person who's writing the work makes you the stakeholder with the most power -- and as Spider-Man has taught us all, with great power comes great responsibility. I agree with JDCorley's sentiment further up the thread that the target audience matters A LOT, and that special care needs to be taken when dealing with marginalized cultures and cultures whose histories have been erased by the mainstream. Authors should feel a sense of responsibility there to not do any more damage than has already been done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

However; that "high-gound" is not always on the side of truth, or a constructive way to deal with the issues at hand. Often it deals with opposition by demonizing it, and creating straw-men to batter. That is bad for all parties. <br/><br/>I believe such behavior may be corrected by calling out how bad it is, and by being steadfast in providing arguments that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377574/#Comment_377574" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T13:27:19+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  1:27PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite>This is a metaphysical minefield.

Figuring out the right is a complex question, obviously. As many other hobbyists of philosophy, I have my own snappy answer to it by the time I turn 30 (10 days to go!), but it's clearly not a topic we can truly cover here in depth on a rpg discussion board.<br/><br/>Given that we have some sense of how to go about it, though, it seems to me that knowing right from wrong enables us to articulate our duties as artists, too. This is why I'm so interested in this appropriation thing, as it seems to me that surely these people are so concerned about this because of some moral principle they're applying. I can get wrought and wrathful with the best of them myself, but I'll usually get that way only in matters of justice, so I'm sort of assuming that something like that is underlying the issues here, too. This is why I like Liam's articulation about social responsibility - if you're hurting people with your art, is that not of concern to you? Consequently the question then becomes, how to balance this moral evil against others, and how to recognize the moral hazards present in engaging other people in cultural dialogues that are in peril of being hurtful. And of course, as a skeptic I have to also ask whether this is a moral good we're discussing in the first place - perhaps hurting other people is not a moral issue, or maybe Liam's wrong about hurt happening. Many things to consider before any sort of moral certainty may be reached.<br/><br/>That's in my head, though, and evidently folks are mostly interested in the practical best practices issues rather than the morality of e.g. Bill's publishing Ganakagok as it was. I'm fine with that, too, and learning a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377578/#Comment_377578" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T13:43:42+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  1:43PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 2:14PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Maybe it is that simple. So self-identified people who care about what you're doing are the stakeholders in your project. So the advice essentially boils down to listening to the people who care about what you're doing, and engaging in dialogue with them about it. Preferably publish in stages and use modern methodology so you don't end up with shit on the market where you can't withdraw it and try again once the stakeholders dialogue has progressed.<br/><br/>What do you do with stakeholders who disagree with each other? Also, aren't you a stakeholder yourself in your own work?</blockquote>\nYeah, being respectful and disagreeing are not mutually exclusive. If you demonstrate that you understand somebody's position and then give them a well-considered reason for why you went a different way, you will probably find they respect you a lot more than if you say something like "what do you mean "oriental" is an offensive word? I've never heard that!"<br/><br/>Expertise is probably the most important aspect of stakeholdership. Knowledge, practice, language, and belief are all areas where people do constant boundary work, making it perhaps a bit too simplistic to just say "anyone who cares" is a stakeholder, because just off the top of my head, there's a bunch of different, distinct categories that a potential game designer would have to deal with differently:<br/><br/>1.<br/>The most important stakeholder group is the one with personal experience of the subject matter, i.e. people who speak the language, regularly engage in the practices, etc. So, if your game is inspired by Inuit cultural ideas and practices, as in Bill's case, this group is the Inuit peoples themselves. If you're writing a game about African park rangers, then it's African park rangers. They're not a distinct ethnic group or nationality, of course, but I assume they have their own culture and jargon and whatnot like any profession. If your subject is the pre-contact Aztecs or the pre-Hellenistic Egyptians, then there are no people in group 1. Which doesn't mean the next three categories are any smaller or less vocal.<br/><br/>2.<br/>Then there are people with knowledge and experience but who, for one reason or another, can't identify 1:1 as part of that group. So, like anthropologists, linguists, and historians who specialize in Inuit culture but are not Inuit. Or non-Inuit in other fields who say, live and work in the arctic with Inuit people. If you're an outsider looking to write a game, this is probably the best group to make contact with first, because they are both knowledgeable and are experienced in communicating their knowledge to other people outside the subject culture. They also tend to write a lot of stuff, especially the academics, so you can just go read that stuff, too, and not pester anyone until you kinda sorta know what you're talking about, at least a little bit.<br/><br/>3.<br/>Then there are people who self-identify with the subject matter and consider it emblematic of or essential to their culture, regardless of knowledge or practice. So, there are Mexicans who only speak Spanish but are still proud of their indigenous heritage and don't want to see it caricatured or exploited. There were Britons who felt that since they had started reading Xenophon when they were twelve years old that they had the right to dig up whatever they wanted and crate it back to England, and now there are Greeks who want the Elgin marbles back. But also, if Eero Tuovinen, Finnish game designer, goes and lives in Israel for ten years and writes a game based on his observations, he will at some point have to deal with American Jews who have never been to Israel but nevertheless feel they have a right to critique his game and its portrayal of Israel. However, if he really spent ten years in Israel, then he has already become part of group <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, right? So yes, you are of course a stakeholder in your own work insofarasmuch as you know what you are talking about. If, when you start, you know next to nothing about the subject you are interested in, then you are not really a stakeholder. Hell, if you don't know anything at the end, either, you might not even be part of group 3, you might still not be a stakeholder! If you know nothing about the subject of your game and can't self-identify with it, I would say that's a pretty clear case of exploitative cultural appropriation.<br/><br/>4.<br/>There's also people who have a stake by association (for lack of a better term), mainly because of colonialism. Like, Bill's game is inspired by Inuit culture, but because he's an outsider, all indigenous peoples of the Americas are stakeholders. Even though Inuit, and say, Mayan, Navaho, and Coast Salish cultures are all completely different, white settler culture tends to treat them all the same. So, if Bill's game is some Orientalistic hack job, non-Inuit peoples can be fairly certain he would treat their cultures in the same way. If Bill writes his game in a more informed manner, and it promotes respect for and understanding of the Inuit, then other indigenous peoples can point to it and say "we would like our dealings with the dominant culture to be more like this more often."<br/><br/>And these are just general types of groups who might feel they have a stake in your game. There might be more that I'm forgetting, and certainly there will be other perspectives on this. I'm just one dude.<br/><br/>In terms of when stakeholders disagree, if one of them is from group 1 and another is not, it's probably best to go with group 1. Especially if it's you they have an issue with, because telling someone they are wrong about something they know more about than you do is a bad position to be in. Group 2 is probably a small group, or at least the academic portion of it is. Group 3 can be pretty large unless your subject is obscure, and it can include everything from reasonable people all the way to American Christians who believe it's their job to start a war in the Holy Land so the Apocalypse can happen. You probably don't want to consult them about your living-in-Israel game. Group 4 is probably the easiest group to impress? If you show respect for groups 1-3, that's kinda what group 4 is looking out for, so you don't have to do anything extra, really.<br/><br/>Does any of that make sense? I'm getting sleepy and it looks like a wall of text now.<br/><br/>disclosure: Eero in Israel is a fake example I made up.

That's why it's hard, and that's why it needs to be taken seriously. It's not about giving offense, it's about communicating a vision that you have and want to share. In the case of Ganakagok, it's about highlighting the powerful human drama that the game can produce, that has to do with imagining the reactions and responses of people faced with the death of their world and their hope for its rebirth. Pace Chris Chinn, that's not exotification; if anything, it's <i>domestication</i>. But you cannot refrain from judging, or ask someone else to judge for you.

I've myself been developing a theory over the years where Nordic (and European in general) white-collar professionals and academics tend to be more abrasive and intense socially than their American counterparts. Like, Americans expect more conservative thinking and group-think on the level of ideas while being pretty free-wheeling socially (not liberal, just informal), while Europeans tend to respect and value good manners while taking ideas less personally and being more free in debate, and less prone to merely reaffirming other's thinking. Stereotypes, obviously, based on my own biased experiences. But something like that could explain why both sides in an interaction could perceive themselves as behaving well while the other side is being insufferably rude or hypocritical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377609/#Comment_377609" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T15:36:07+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  3:36PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 3:40PM by Wordman.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nameless</cite>But culture is like a tree. It starts as a seed, grows to a seedling, then a sapling, then a full grown tree, eventually dies and becomes a snag, and then a fallen log. At each point along this timeline, there is no doubt that it is the same tree, despite not being identical. At every point along this timeline, there is value. Just like the tree, there may come a point when taking part of the tree will not kill it. But there is no point when taking something will not change it. And when a culture or tree has had so much taken from it, so much insult in it's lifetime, you can understand when the culture or tree says "No more. The rest is mine to share as I like, but you have no right to just take." While the culture lives, you have no right to take from it. And only those who live the culture have a right to say if it is alive.</blockquote>\nI understand what Nameless are saying here. It is a powerful, poignant, metaphor. But, it has a (fruitful) flaw. I want to point it out, because I think it cuts to the heart of why threads like this get so contentious, and maybe can lead us to a better way to talk about this. The flaw is this: when I take a part of a tree, I now have that part, but the tree no longer does. But when I make a part of another culture into myself, I now have that part, but <i>so does the original culture</i>. Unlike the tree, it is not a zero-sum game. And <i>exactly because</i> it is <i>not</i> a zero sum game, this ability we all have\u2014this knack for taking what we are exposed to and using it to help define and redefine ourselves into something better\u2014is absolutely the best part of being a human being. It is the only thing about life on this planet that is constantly surprising and worthwhile.<br/><br/>So, because of this, I greet attempts to call this ability "theft" with chagrin. Declarations of who "has no right" to do this and who does seem to me to move the discussion in exactly the wrong direction. Even just the term "cultural appropriation" seems to ill-serve those who use it, because it focuses the discussion on the wrong thing. These terms convey the idea that it is the "taking" of other cultures that is the problem, but that isn't actually what you are talking about; the objections are about <i>something else</i>. I want to talk about that something else.<br/><br/>In the paragraphs that follow Nameless' metaphor, he talks about a some very real damage. But none of these objections read to me to be because of "taking" culture in an of itself. Rather its seems they fall into two basic areas (there are no doubt others as well). One is <i>what is done with the culture once it is "taken"</i>. In other words, people are using their ability to incorporate experience into themselves not to make themselves better, but to do harm. The other is harder to pinpoint, but is something like <i>thinking you are taking a culture, when you are actually buying into an inaccuracy</i>. Part of this idea also seems to be that once enough people get the wrong idea, the wrong idea perpetuates itself, and this acts to sort of "drown out" the legitimate culture.<br/><br/>Focussing on areas like this from the beginning would be a lot more helpful in getting me to understand you than a fixation on "stealing culture" does. Tips on things I can do in daily life, such as "when you take aspects from living cultures, then reuse them for your own ends, be careful that you know what you are talking about. Be careful that you are not recombining hurtful stereotypes, or even romanticized stereotypes" are very useful, at least to me. Statements like "you have no right to take from my culture"? Not so useful, at least to me.<br/><br/>Since all of this is likely to get me rapped in the mouth anyway, might as well talk about another aspect of culture:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>There's a point at which members of society have to simply accept that a culture has entered the public domain and they no longer have any ownership claim over it.

And that moment happens the very second when that culture interacts with another. Whether those cultures like it or not, they are now infecting each other with experience.

(The question being, what's the problem with cultural appropriation.) Some follow-up questions:<br/><br/>How do you do harm with appropriated culture? Is it by mixing in lies and thus smearing a culture with e.g. racist propaganda? The appropriated bits make the lie more convincing? Or should I be thinking of something more insidious here?<br/><br/>Also, about drowning out legitimate culture with wrong ideas: how do you do this in reality? Is this something like lying to people about their own culture to damage their self-identity? I can get the blatant forms of this from national historical memory, Russification is one of the big spooks of the Finnish history; too many nearby examples of people who are no more (either living or acknowledged as having ever lived) after the Tsarists and Communists got through with their re-education regimes (which failed in Finland, to be exact). But what about, how do you do this sort of thing insidiously? Also, does this happen without intent, or only intentionally?<br/><br/>Are both of those types of harm present in Bill's execution of Ganakagok, or is it mostly just one of them? Or neither, perhaps his appropriation wasn't so evil in nature?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377622/#Comment_377622" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T16:13:40+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  4:13PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I believe such behavior may be corrected by calling out how bad it is, and by being steadfast in providing arguments that makes sense.</blockquote>\nThe problem is that this is the exact thought process that people used in responding to you in that thread.

If you were the creators of NIKE sandals, and you had a long history of creating NIKE sandals, then one day there were all these almost-NIKE sandals, only they were not made with the care of NIKE, but people didn't understand the difference because they had never really had a chance to wear a real set of NIKE sandals, and now real NIKE sandals were 0.1% of what people thought of when they heard of NIKE sandals, then would you be happy?<br/><br/>Imperfect analogy aside, in a world where your homeland, your family, your dignity, your, language, your spirituality, your version of history, and even the legal right to claim your own ancestry have been "legally" denied to you, when someone takes what you and your ancestors have spent hundreds of years and real blood and lives defending your right to practice, when it is something you find so important that you would die to defend the rights of your children to know and practice, when they take it and use it flippantly without care for what it means to you, then you will have the right to say "That wouldn't bother me." And even after you have the right to say that, you will never have the right to tell me I should not get offended when you do that to me.<br/><br/>There are real world hurts that are associated with the casual appropriation of the cultures of the marginalized. Those hurts are derived from being continuously denied a voice in what would be considered the world outside the cultures of the marginalized, and then capping that with being denied a voice in the meaning/significant/use/right to their own culture. This is hard to understand for those who come from a culture whose basic and central tenet is to shove their culture down your throat whether you want it or not. It is easier to understand for those who have not always had the right to determine whether they accept that outside culture or not. <br/><br/>And no, this is not about wanting to keep things as they once were. This is about respecting my right to my culture. I am willing to share my culture, but only with those who are willing to respect it the way that I do. Otherwise, it is another example of marginalization. I would have used the term racism, but that seems to provoke some hurt feelings.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377640/#Comment_377640" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T18:00:31+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  6:00PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>The world is a better place when people get to mutilate and spindle other people's art in order to create new art.

It would still be valid, even if you posted about it on game forums, even though your ancestors did not.

When a property is not still under copy right...you don't.<br/><br/>I propose the exact same model holds.  When a culture is within the window* it is your responsibility to treat it with the respect and consideration it deserves.  When its outside the window its now as much your culture as anyone's and you treat it however you like.<br/><br/>So I think the concept helps in two ways.  <br/><br/>1) it acts as a reminder to tread lightly.  People who would never think of stealing intellectual property can thus see that they're doing the same thing to cultural property.  People who would view such thieving as piracy and refuse to patronize it can thus see that they need to treat cultural piracy the same way.<br/><br/>2) it acts as a safe haven principal that can be used to protect creators and their creations from accusations of appropriation that shouldn't be allowed to hold more value than the act of creation holds.  And that to me is just as important as the first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377653/#Comment_377653" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T19:03:03+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  7:03PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 7:03PM by UserClone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Lee">@Lee</a>: Don't get me wrong, I'm hoping catholicism, judaism, hunduism, buddhism, and all the rest go the way of the dinosaur, too.

It's kind of a mind-fuck to realize how many people are treating a culture as though it's dead already because, in their eyes, it's as good as dead...that's twisted. In Ireland, for example, there's only a small number, say several hundred, people for whom Irish is a first language. But their government goes out of its way to ensure that every schoolchild is taught to speak it, because their ancestors fought so hard against the invasion of the English. Kind of makes you wonder where the US and Canada get off marginalizing the myriad cultures that existed here before ours the way we do, such as the Choctaw.

Why can't my culture be a living breathing culture similar to Catholicism? Why is it OK to make these claims about marginalized people, but it would sound offensive and ridiculous to state them about dominant cultures?<br/><br/>Actually, I'm going way beyond this.  ALL culture is inevitably doomed, and not only is it not ridiculous to state about dominant cultures...its patently obvious about dominant cultures as well.<br/><br/>Modern English Culture is no longer 12th century English Culture.  I, as a citizen of Earth, have as much claim (as do you and everyone else in the world) to 12th Century England as the modern English do.  <br/><br/>All cultures get wiped out.  Older cultures influenced today...but they are not today.<br/><br/>To use a different analogy, cultures evolve...just like animals...only a whole lot faster.  And when they evolve past a certain point they create a new species.  And the new species may have evolved directly from the older species, and it would thus be fair to say that the new species would not have existed without the older species...but it would be wrong to say that the new species is a member of the older species.  Categorizing it as such would be wrong.  For a time members of both the old species and the new species can live side by side, and sometimes its the old species that survives and sometimes its the new species that survives.  But when the last living member of a species dies...that species is extinct. <br/><br/>There may continue to be a species that greatly resemble that other species...but its not that other species and never will be.<br/><br/>And so it is for culture. <br/><br/>The culture you're talking about being doomed...its not doomed.  Its already gone.  And its never coming back.  And what you have today can be grand, and amazing, and wondrous, and unique...but it isn't that older culture.  It can be inspired by that older culture but it isn't that culture, that culture is already dead.  What you have is its own thing. I 100% respect and acknowledge your ownership of the culture you're ACTUALLY a part of.  But that older culture...that older culture didn't include internet access and discussing social justice on gaming forums.  <br/><br/>That older culture is already gone, and at some point it should be freely owned by every citizen of planet Earth to do whatever they please with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377661/#Comment_377661" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T19:31:23+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  7:31PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All true except that the concept of species and evolution only makes sense with the addition of the concept of reproductive isolation.

I have various joint problems in my legs as a result/as well. And of course it's tough to get things off of high shelves. :-)<br/><br/>I would say that I am a stakeholder in the "cultures" of: a) people with disabilities in general, b) people with physical disabilities more specifically, and c) people with orthopedic disabilities even more specifically.<br/><br/>But there are some specific disability subcultures that I'm really not a part of, and wouldn't be any more welcome in than someone who is able-bodied, nor would I be knowledgeable about those groups or feel prepared to speak on their behalf. I'm thinking in particular here of the deaf, but there are other examples I'm sure.<br/><br/>I also want to go ahead and acknowledge that I am in many ways a *terrible* and *irresponsible* stakeholder. The intersectionality of my disabilities with my class, education, and other things have made it so that participating in disability culture is essentially optional for me. That is a privilege my friends who also have disabilities mostly don't have.<br/><br/>But, like, do you have to be disabled to be a stakeholder? No, not really. I'd respect the opinion of someone who had, say, majored in Disability Studies almost above my own if they wanted to comment on an RPG about people with disabilities. And, to be sure, my able-bodied sister is a stakeholder in disability, simply because she's related to me. Someone who was married to a person with a disability would definitely get stakeholder status as well.<br/><br/>By the way, since people with disabilities tend not to cluster in the way that ethnic or religious groups do, it can in some ways be harder to pin down the "culture" and thus the appropriation thereof. It does happen, though. The main way is through a trope called the "supercrip." This is when someone with a disability is celebrated for doing something amazing like climbing a mountain or whatever, and it's almost always framed as them "overcoming" their disability. This is bad because no matter what you accomplish, you still have to live with your disability. The other, more insidious implication is that PWDs who *don't* accomplish amazing things in spite of their disabilities must live lives of constant misery, loneliness, bitterness, and worthlessness. (And don't even get me started on disability and sexuality...)<br/><br/>So, if someone came to me with an RPG about disability and it was all about how you were supposed to overcome it during the game, I'd be pretty pissed, to say the least. But it's not outside the scope of my imagination that some sensitive person, able-bodied though they might be, might write an RPG about disability, play it with me, and have me react positively.<br/><br/>Which brings me back full circle to the topic of Ganakagok. I suspect (though obviously I can't know for sure) that if an Inuit person who knew a lot about their culture and mythology were to play the game, they'd be likely to nod and be like, "Yeah, that's about right." Of course, not every stakeholder would necessarily see it the same way\u2014maybe some would love it and others would find it problematic*. Maybe the best thing would be to aim for at least an 80-20 love/hate ratio?<br/><br/>One final comment: I do think that RPGs have one advantage on these issues over other media, which is that they ask us to directly identify with the character we are playing, in a way even books do not. Now, of course some people are simply going to play for laughs, and will happily just portray some stereotype if they are playing a character of a different race or sexual orientation or whatever. But anyone playing in good faith won't take this approach.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*Now that I think about it, I kind of wonder how blind people feel about Toph from Avatar? I personally thought she was a great character and that, though she does in many ways "overcome" her disability with her tremor sense, it doesn't always work, they make blind jokes, etc. This to me felt very true to life. But I am not blind!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377696/#Comment_377696" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T02:13:19+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  2:13AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, I think that we may be way into edge case territory here, and you may be in danger of writing a law of one man.

As I said before, there's no such thing as objective historical knowledge.<br/><br/>Like, let's say you want to make a game based on Ancient Greek literature (epic, tragedy, comedy, let's say). There are no issues of appropriation whatsoever. For centuries, the people who have preserved these works have promoted them and done all they can to spread them. Meanwhile, they are part of European history, and Europeans have done the same thing with their history. They preserve it, they promote it, they want everybody to know about it, and they keep all this stuff from the past around, as distinct pieces of history compartmentalized from everyday, living culture. It's actually really, really easy to pronounce this stuff public domain, and all the aspects that encourage this are most pronounced with regard to Ancient Greek literature.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there's the archaeological knowledge, which has been recovered as part of Western Europe's physical and economic colonialism. There's a lot of material culture whose ownership is contested because British people and other Europeans dug it up and took it without asking anybody and then used it to promote their own political ideas. There's a lot that isn't contested, too, but that's still something to keep in mind. Re-framing it so that these works belong to a dead culture and thus are "up for grabs" is a tactic that's been used against Greeks and Egyptians before.<br/><br/>In the Americas, there's no history per se, since there's no written documents. Knowledge of historical cultures comes from either archaeology or oral history. The archaeology, if anything, is vastly more problematic than Classical archaeology or Egyptology in terms of colonialism and the violence done to living people. It's also entirely material culture that is recovered by these methods, so there's certain limitations put on what there is that you can even appropriate.<br/><br/>Oral history on the other hand is, by definition, part of a living culture. So any access to the past you can gain from it comes to you as part of a living culture, so any issues of copyright or public domain you could possibly think of applying are completely nullified.<br/><br/>Now, in certain parts of the Americas, we have a long history of European settlement and thus written records. And some of those records were made in order to preserve indigenous art and culture. So, like, I've written lyrics for songs that were inspired by Aztec poetry (which I can only read in English translation). I don't write songs about the Aztecs, but I've borrowed some imagery and some metaphors, because I like them a lot. And these are ideas that have exited the culture of living people long ago. At the same time, however, some of these poems also describe the founding myth of Tenochtitlan and Mexico, which is still a current part of Mexican culture, as far as I know (that's what the book said, anyway). So even if we decide that these words that were written down in the 16th century are public domain, that's not going to stop Mexicans living now from identifying it as one of their cultural referents and be concerned about it. If you disrespect them by using it, you still have to deal with that, and if they're going to make an issue of it, you have to deal with that too.<br/><br/>And finally, the other issue is that, well, if we're going to think of cultural property in terms of intellectual property, you can't actually get any information on the Aztecs in English that's public domain, or not much. All that knowledge still belongs to people who haven't been dead for fifty years (Canadian copyright is death+50). History in the Americas is a lot younger than history in Europe. This is sort of a separate issue and not exactly an argument against your idea, but it's a complication to be aware of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan" title="Jonathan"><img alt="Jonathan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">Jonathan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377762/#Comment_377762" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T08:07:42+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  8:07AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Absolutely...I think Stakeholders is highly practical...and useful...within the window.<br/><br/>Outside of the window we are no longer talking about marginalized people being disenfranchised.

Not some sort of expiry on a clock, but clear and active attempts at Genocide.  Shouldn't the people in question, these stakeholders, have any say in what's going on?  If your answer is no, then you're one of those people who feel that they should have a say, and there you have colonialism in a nut shell.<br/><br/>"I know that people like me have come before and tried to take this away from you by force, and by death, and by appropriation.

Help me navigate these troubling waters so I can make a great game.

And while I agree with Ralph that Disney's cold dead hand is driving extant IP law to the point of absurdity, I think that it is reasonable for communities--cultures!--to want to resist the effects of turning their cultural productions into commodities for others' consumption, of drowning their local culture in the sea of undifferentiated "mass culture," and of being stereotyped or misrepresented in the larger or dominant culture. It is the same logic that makes France <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a989739a-6157-11e1-a738-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1uZXI1UCq" rel="nofollow">subsidize French film production firms</a>, so that it can sustain a home-grown cultural industry. <br/><br/>And it matters, too, that these processes of cultural evolution, transformation, and competition take place in a social and political realm where who gets to be a cultural stakeholder is "contested" (i.e., fought over). I read a journal article recently called "Blood-Speak: Ward Churchill and the Racialization of American Indian Identity" (reference below) that pointed out the irony of racial laws and policies that understood anyone with "one drop of Negro blood" to be black but that required much more extensive evidence of native American heritage in order for someone to be a "real Indian." The article points out that these definitions were sometimes employed in order for the U.S. government to limit its obligations, but at other times in order for native American groups to control access to communal resources and to do what could be called "boundary work."<br/><br/>So issues of power should be taken into account when trying to distinguish one's ethical accountability to cultural stakeholders, which is what Ralph is not seeing or disagrees with.<br/><br/><br/>Reference:<br/><br/>Kelly, C.R. (2011). Blood-speak: Ward Churchill and the racialization of American Indian identity. <i>Communication &amp; Critical/Cultural Studies, 8</i>(3), 240-265. Abstract: After publishing a controversial essay on 9/11, Professor Ward Churchill's scholarship and personal identity were subjected to a hostile public investigation. Evidence that Churchill had invented his American Indian identity created vehemence among many professors and tribal leaders who dismissed Churchill because he was not a 'real Indian.' This essay examines the discourses of racial authenticity employed to distance Churchill from tribal communities and American Indian scholarship. Responses to Churchill's academic and ethnic self-identification have retrenched a racialized definition of tribal identity defined by a narrow concept of blood. Employing what I term blood-speak, Churchill's opponents harness a biological concept of race that functions as an instrument of exclusion and a barrier to coalitional politics.

I'm not sure how accurate all the information in it is, but it raises some great questions about identity, media, and culture, and the "cultural appropriation" (? correct term?) of the Native American culture in America and Europe. I see a lot of parallels here between what we're talking about with game design, and what they're talking about with film.<br/><br/>It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel_Injun" rel="nofollow">Reel Injun</a>, and it's streaming on Netflix. I found a lot of it really interesting and informative. <br/><br/>From the Wikipedia page:<br/><i>Reel Injun explores many stereotypes about Natives in film, from the Noble savage to the Drunken Indian. It profiles such figures as Iron Eyes Cody, who reinvented himself as a Native American on screen. The film also explores Hollywood's practice of using Italian Americans and American Jews to portray Indians in the movies and reveals how some Native American actors made jokes in their native tongue on screen, when the director thought they were simply speaking gibberish.</i><br/><br/>(edited for rephrasing of things!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377814/#Comment_377814" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T11:29:00+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 11:29AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Absolutely...I think Stakeholders is highly practical...and useful...within the window.<br/><br/>Outside of the window we are no longer talking about marginalized people being disenfranchised.  We're talking about people who have no legitimate claim attempting to deny the world free access to what should by then be public domain.  And I guess that's my position.  You don't get to claim that culture forever...no matter how much it means to you, or how dearly you want to...you don't get to.  You don't have that right, any more than Disney has the right to own the Mouse forever.<br/><br/>And the reason why that's important...is because at some point you shouldn't HAVE to respect the answers.  In fact, at some point, the world is better off if you DON'T respect the answers...because what is being created is an art that's worth having even if the original owners would be offended by it.</blockquote>\nFirst of all, I will again note that I don't think that intellectual property is the proper way to look at this.  <br/><br/>To illustrate, there is a basic inequality here, though.  Someone might claim that, say, the modern-day Lakota tribe members no longer have a legitimate claim to the culture of historical figures such as T\u021fa\u0161\xfa\u014bke Witk\xf3 (aka Crazy Horse).  However, outsiders are likely to react to modern-day Lakota members (and others) through the lens of what they see in works like "Dances With Wolves" or various film portrayals of Crazy Horse.  The same goes for modern-day Mongolians and Genghis Khan, or modern-day Nahuatl speakers and the Aztec Empire.  <br/><br/>I don't believe that there should be a time-limited ownership of the culture that prevents portrayal of that culture by outsiders.  Instead, I think that regardless of the time period, insider and/or informed portrayals of the culture should not be drowned out by outside and/or uninformed portrayals.  This is not the same thing as ownership, because outside portrayals are fine up to the point that they are not drowning out the insider portrayals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377867/#Comment_377867" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T16:09:40+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  4:09PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Rose" rel="nofollow">Fascinating case study.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377903/#Comment_377903" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T00:46:26+00:00" title="May 12, 2012 12:46AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>And the reason why that's important...is because at some point you shouldn't HAVE to respect the answers.

In fact, at some point, the world is better off if you DON'T respect the answers...because what is being created is an art that's worth having even if the original owners would be offended by it.</blockquote>\nThis is almost exactly what was said to justify the land grab, the forced relocation, the residential schools, etc...<br/><br/>"You have had possession of this land since God put you there. What have you done with it? The world will be a better place if someone else did something creative/productive with it. You may be upset, but I don't have to respect that. What is being created is progress in the name of God, and that is more important than how upset you might become."<br/><br/>Appropriation is appropriation, even if it can be rationalized.<br/><br/>Your process serves to justify the forcible appropriation of something that originally belonged to someone else. You created a rule to help you feel better about it, but if someone else gets upset about it, then obviously there are stakeholders that would have been better dealt with through engagement, rather than through a rule rationalizing upsetting behavior. If, as you are saying, there are situations that could arise that have no "legitimate" stakeholders, and that you should have every right just to plunder the culture as you see fit, then who will be there to get upset? Wouldn't this situation have been identified through a process of attempted identification of stakeholders?<br/><br/>In short, this is the crux of the debate:<br/><br/>1) You have said "The world will be a better place if I take what you think you have rights to, as long as I follow this rule. This rule easily identifies situations where there are no legitimate stakeholders." I think that is a tired justification for all the colonialism in history.<br/><br/>2) I have said, there may be cases where there are no "legitimate" stakeholders per your rule, but identifying all possible stakeholders and engaging them is a better process than pre-emptivly taking any rights that they might have through an arbitrarily based rule. In situations where your rule may apply without taking away the rights of some people, there will be no one to get upset, and hence, no stakeholders. Hence, your rule serves no good purpose.<br/><br/>So here is what I was asking for Ralph. I would love to hear about a situation in real life of a case of an outside person taking a bit of culture from another people, ensuring that it is outside your "window", and that following this there was outcry about it from people who are upset about the appropriation of "their" culture, and then why they truly have no right to be upset. I want to hear about when your rule could apply and actually mean something. Otherwise it is just staking a claim on territory that doesn't exist, and doing so in a way that comes across as very threatening to marginalized people. Especially since it feels to me like you are stating that my culture is on the edge of becoming ripe for plunder in a way that is fully justifiable in the name of bettering the world through "art".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377909/#Comment_377909" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T02:16:57+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  2:16AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Terra Nullius.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377919/#Comment_377919" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T06:24:54+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  6:24AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2012 6:28AM by Rafael.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to hear about someone who actually did all this stuff you guys are talking about.

I feel like I'm hearing some of the latter, but I can't discern whether that's anyone's actual position; or whether what-I-think-I'm-hearing is merely a side-effect of the rhetorical devices being employed to make the former point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377935/#Comment_377935" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T09:08:02+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  9:08AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2012 10:08AM by Johnstone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I'm assuming this wasn't your intention,</span> Todd, but your post reads like you think my question was an attempt to make Rafael ashamed and be silent, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and you are telling me I should be ashamed of it and be silent instead.</span> So, for my part, since it <i>was</i> rather snarky, I'll clarify: It's a serious question and I'm fully prepared to respond to a serious answer.<br/><br/>And just in case you're not clear on my position and would like to be: I don't think Ralph's idea is hurtful, I think it won't help you write a game that won't make people upset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377944/#Comment_377944" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T11:01:42+00:00" title="May 12, 2012 11:01AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>I want to hear about someone who actually did all this stuff you guys are talking about. Not Bill, because he did it after Ganakagok game out. I want to hear about someone who published a game and sold it, after identifying some stakeholders and engaging them. That would be cool.</blockquote>\nWell, one of the reasons this discussion is cropping up is that, historically, it hasn't happened much. Most games about non-mainstream cultures that engaged with the cultures were written by people who were already strongly associated with those cultures. For example, I wrote Dog Eat Dog, but it's basically about myself. You might look at Julia's post in that sunk thread about Aokigahara. Also I think Shreyas is eventually going to write SOMETHING about Mist-Robed Gate.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>Also, I want to be sure that I understand this correctly: Matthew Sullivan-Barrett's<i>Monsters of Glam</i>, which is about Glam rockers trashing hotel rooms and getting laid, is tantamount to genocide (or, at the very least, land displacement) because it appropriates Coyote the Trickster God. Am I getting this right?</blockquote>\nNope! Do you honestly think that's what people are saying in this thread? Because it's so inaccurate that I can't help but read that as mockery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P

is about Glam rockers trashing hotel rooms and getting laid, is tantamount to genocide (or, at the very least, land displacement) because it appropriates Coyote the Trickster God. Am I getting this right?</blockquote>\nSoooo, feels weird to be addressing this, but since Monsters of Glam was mentioned in what I think was a hyperbolic example of appropriation:<br/>I don't know if it productively relates to the largely fruitful discussion in this thread so far, but it is definitely true that there was regrettable carelessness in including Coyote in MoG. Again, I don't know it is worth discussing further, but if anyone feels otherwise I am happy to participate. And to apologize if the lazy use is problematic to anyone.<br/><br/>Past that, I want to express deep appreciation for the parties that have been so active in raising awareness of these issues. Speaking for myself, I have found the ongoing discussions very valuable, and appreciate the considerable efforts to address these difficult subjects with so much patience and empathy. I know I have learned much, have much to think on, and have much more to learn.

Saying that you don't need to do your diligence because a culture has passed it's "ownership window" like this is an IP discussion is problematic.<br/>    a. Because it casts the individual saying that the culture is passed its window without being a part of it is part of that colonial mentality<br/>    b. If you aren't going to be the one who defines it, who does?  The people in question?  What if they say no? Do you as the outsider get to over-rule them?  If so, see point 1a.<br/><br/>2. The Art defence, where a person who hasn't done their due diligence cries, "But it's art" is a lazy, privileged position.<br/>    a. Calling something art doesn't deflect it from being problematic and harmful<br/>    b. Just because it's art doesn't mean it's good art (yes that's a subjective term, and problematic but if you're just portraying stereotypes then you really aren't saying anything other than the fact that you know cultural stereotypes).<br/><br/>3. You don't have to do anything here.  No one is going to stand over your shoulder glowering at you disapprovingly while you make something that relies on a culture and turns trips over all the intellectual potholes that you missed for not doing your due dilligence.<br/>   a. Expecting people to applaud you for it is naive.<br/>   b. Expecting people not to criticise for you it is doubly naive.<br/><br/>I would like to add to the series of people who have come in here and said, "Wow, this is information and I'm going to take this and digest it."

It would have been better to ask you before citing M.O.G. <br/><br/>Personally, I thought your game was awesome and fun, but couldn't figure out how the use of Coyote was anything other than more fun on the fun cake. Which is why I asked that question -- which, to be honest, didn't seem all that hyperbolic, because I've gone back and reread the points bringing up comparisons to land-grabs and such, and it still feels like bringing all of that up is perhaps overdoing it. I mean, it just feels like using words like 'genocide' when talking about RPGs is a bit of a stretch. Then again, I'm coming at this from a different perspective. But I just wanted to make sure I understand why those terms were being used -- were people actually trying to compare the publication of an RPG to land grabs and cultural genocide?<br/><br/>Still, I had no right to drag you into this. I'm sorry!

Objectively, zero people play or read non-D&amp;D RPGs, within some tiny margin of error.  Whatever harm RPGs may or may not do is minimal at best. In the days of the silent Western, Hollywood cranked out dozens on dozens of more or less interchangeable films. The harm that any single one of them did by its portrayal of natives is relatively minimal. Collectively, and over time, and in context, and with the audience it had, though?  It's not any single harm that's the issue.<br/><br/>To put it another way: we should at least try to weed our own garden.  (This analogy also is good because a lot of times the weeds come from outside the garden - and what we put into RPGs comes from our outside society too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377965/#Comment_377965" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T14:26:04+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  2:26PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Maybe I'm just taking it for granted because I already understand what Lee's saying, so if it seems like I'm impatient with those who don't, sorry.

I took it at face value, you meant what you said -- you wanted to know where I'm coming from. Which is totally cool by me. I mean, we may see things differently, but just talking, hashing it out, that's how people learn. And I'm interested in this topic, it's a bit of an eye-opener. So your input's cool with me.<br/><br/>As for the question. Well, Nameless said, "This is almost exactly what was said to justify the land grab, the forced relocation, the residential schools, etc... 'You have had possession of this land since God put you there. What have you done with it? The world will be a better place if someone else did something creative/productive with it. You may be upset, but I don't have to respect that. What is being created is progress in the name of God, and that is more important than how upset you might become.' Appropriation is appropriation, even if it can be rationalized."<br/><br/>And I'm looking that, and I'm thinking, well, hang on. Are we really saying that putting something in an RPG, and then going, well, it's art -- is the same as someone taking land away? The former strikes me as a good think -- making art -- and the latter strikes me as something awful, something that my kid will learn about, even if it gets glossed over in school (which is what happened to me -- I mean, my primary-school teachers and textbooks left out all the atrocities and I didn't really learn about the genocide of the indigenous peoples of North America until much later). I'll see that he learns the truth, because it's worth learning about. And I'll see that he learns to respect the cultures of others. Because that matters.<br/><br/>But to be honest, I thought it was a bit of a stretch to say that 'appropriation is appropriation,' because there's a huge difference between cultural appropriation and the appropriation of territory. I'm not saying that one is acceptable -- it's not my place to say that cultural appropriation is okay -- but I'm just saying, I think we're talking about apples and orifices.

I actually hadn't made that connection.<br/><br/>Well, let's mull that one over, because that would be pretty interesting. So, I take religion, mess around with it, produce something. You could call it art, but that would be a bit of a stretch, yeah? More like, just a game. Demons and shotguns and such. Appropriate the religion, produce something new. But other than the concept itself (which, yeah, I guess is blasphemous), I don't see the harm. I mean, I can see someone religious looking at it and saying, this is offensive. And though I would not wish to hurt anyone, I can imagine it being obnoxious to people if they didn't care for the appropriation of their culture. (Or if they just don't like the idea of angels with tentacles eating people.) But as you note, Christianity is pretty dominant, or privileged or what-have-you, so it's maybe not the same as cultural appropriation of a people that have been displaced or attacked. But I could be wrong about that. So --<br/><br/>If I were to make a third game in the series, would I really be better off getting input from a religious person? Would that help my game? I mean, I kind of think that's where this is going, right? That's the idea -- that a person who actually believes in a holy war between angels and demons would be a stakeholder. So before I take their culture and use it to make a game, I should get some kind of connection going with someone like that. But what would happen? Would I actually change the way I treat angels in my game? And what about research? I mean, I flipped through the Bible. Before my next game is designed, should I actually learn something about religion? It's not really a rhetorical question -- I'm definitely curious about what people think about that.<br/><br/>Is this something that should be applied to a group of creators larger than this tiny sub-slice of a small hobby? I mean, what about Slayer -- should they communicate with a Christian stakeholder before recording another album about religion? What about Iron Maiden's "Run to the Hills"? What about the next novel by Clive Barker? He's got religious stuff in his books (hoo boy, does he ever). Dunno, just kind of thinking out loud on this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377979/#Comment_377979" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T15:35:36+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  3:35PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I can't speak for Lee, but having read all his posts, what I see him doing is explaining why cultural appropriation is so insulting. It's not because it's equivalent to all that other stuff, it's all the other stuff that puts weight behind the insult and makes it hurt more than those of us with privilege would think it would.<br/><br/>This is a crass analogy I'm going to use here, and I'm 'a use some bad words, but fuck it, here goes:<br/><br/>If you call someone a "nigger," who do you think is going to be more offended: the black guy who's had a couple crosses burned on his front yard, or the white dude with a house in the Hamptons?<br/><br/>If you call someone a "whore," who do you think is going to be more offended: the girl who has been repeatedely slut-shamed because she was gang-raped, or the white dude with a lamborghini and a house in the Hamptons?<br/><br/>If you call someone a "faggot," who do you think is going to be more offended: the guy who's boyfriend was beaten to death by bigots because he was out of the closet, or the white dude with a wife and a mistress and a lamborghini and a house in the Hamptons?<br/><br/>That white dude, he's like the honey badger. Honey badger don't care, honey badger don't give a fuck.<br/><br/>Everybody else? <i>Pissed.</i><br/><br/>Now, sure, those are insults. They're meant to be insulting. But you see the different between the subjects of those insults, right? Some things are more insulting because of the deeds and the history behind them. They have weight. To the privileged, it's just a word, it means nothing. To the marginalized and the oppressed, it's a word that means all that other shit, too.<br/><br/>So maybe you use a little coyote here, a little thunderbird there, and maybe you think nothing of it. And maybe First Nations people think nothing of it. Or, maybe they see you taking their cultural referents and using them with no understanding of their culture or the context of those referents, and they think:<br/><br/>"So it's not enough for them to take our land, and our livelihood, and our language. And it's not enough for them to abuse us in residential schools, or restrict us to reservations where our people have never lived before. And it's not enough for them to dig up the bones of our grandparents so they can put them on display and charge admission. It's not enough that they have to do all this, now they have to take our stories and the things we believe in and turn them into stupid jokes, too."<br/><br/>So if you say that you should be able to take coyote and thunderbird and do whatever you want with them without having to consult anybody, it's insulting NOT because misrepresenting those figures is going to deprive anyone of life, land, language, rights, or culture, because it won't. It's insulting because you're saying the exact same thing all those other white men who actually did do those things said, when they said "I want this land, why should I have to consult the Indians?"<br/><br/>That's why it's so insulting. And that's why it's insulting even if you don't mean for it to be insulting. Some people have the privilege of being immune to insults. Other people don't.<br/><br/>But, y'know, just because it's hard to be respectful of a culture that isn't yours doesn't mean it's impossible! There's already a lot of good advice in this thread for how to treat subject material without being offensive, and I don't see it being that hard to get more. I mean, of all the hard work you're going to do on a game anyway, I don't know if learning about another culture and how to be respectful towards it is the most likely to make your game better, but I'm pretty damn sure it's the least likely to make it worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377982/#Comment_377982" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T16:00:04+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  4:00PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>I mean, what about Slayer -- should they communicate with a Christian stakeholder before recording another album about religion?</blockquote>\nHaha!

That's why context matters so much.<br/><br/>I don't buy that at all.  0%.<br/><br/>If you're going pound the table about respecting culture, you've gotta respect all cultures.  If you then go "except that one...its ok to shit on them" then you've reduced everything you've said about respecting culture to hypocrisy...an argument that sounds good but which is really just being used to justify a particular agenda.<br/><br/>"We don't have to care about them because they're a dominant culture" is exactly the same thing in reverse as "We don't have to care about them because they're ignorant savages. <br/><br/><br/>Further I think that the whole Dominant vs. Marginalized thing is a huge red herring.  Very few cultures spend their entire developmental history as one or the other...making it impossible to say its ok to appropriate from a dominant culture and not from a marginalized one, because most cultures have had a spin at both.<br/><br/>So if we're writing a game about Saxons is it ok to appropriate from them when they were the dominant English culture, but its not ok to do a game about them after they'd been marginalized by the Normans...or before that the Danes?<br/><br/>And when we come to North America...the Aztecs, the Maya, the Haudenosaunee (better known by the name their enemies called them, the Iroquois)...these cultures WERE the dominant culture of their respective time and geography.  Each of them brutalized, marginalized, and disenfranchised their neighbors with as much willful aggression as the Europeans eventually did to them. Each one of them were grand amazing cultures...as well as being Right Bastards.  <br/><br/>Are we to then give them special victim status because a bigger nastier enemy, with the technology to be far more efficient in their destructiveness, came and kicked the kings off the mountain?  Is it thus not ok to appropriate from them post European encounter, but ok to appropriate from them pre European encounter when they were dominant?  Does that even make sense?   <br/><br/>No...the dominant vs. marginalized distinction is IMO untenable and unnecessary.  It is IMO an attempt to obfuscate the actual issue (who is entitled to decide how a culture gets portrayed by others) by obfuscating it with a lot of other issues...issues that are vital issues to discuss in their own right, but are totally tangential and a distraction from this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378005/#Comment_378005" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T19:23:13+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  7:23PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>So if we're writing a game about Saxons is it ok to appropriate from them when they were the dominant English culture, but its not ok to do a game about them after they'd been marginalized by the Normans...or before that the Danes?</blockquote>\nYes, absolutely.

I mean, here in the US, they seem pretty dominant, but in Egypt, not so much. So do different rules apply to Egyptian RPG designers? And here in the US, are Mormons dominant or marginalized?</blockquote>\nIt's not an on-or-off thing, but to the degree a group is marginalized, to that degree you must be mindful of appropriating their culture.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem weird to me that an Egyptian game designer, playwright, filmmaker or author might have a different responsibility when presenting something about Christianity (for example) than an American one, remember what I said about audience mattering? I don't really want to go into this because I have really very little knowledge of the current state of Egyptian religious culture, but I don't see anything weird or hypocritical about saying that responsibilities could differ depending on the situation.  <br/><br/>Ralph was using extreme examples, so I responded in kind.  If you pick extreme examples like White History Month (I guess sign Ralph up for that? IDK), you'll get extreme answers.  It's not hypocrisy to say that examples that fall in the middle should receive a proportionate response.<br/><br/>Mormonism is a great example for me for this discussion, thanks for bringing it up.  It's very successful in limited geographical areas, less so in others, and completely marginalized in others.  And I have two examples involving Mormon culture close to hand.  Dogs in the Vineyard is highly critical but also <i>very respectful</i> of Mormonism when it fictionalizes it. A really hilarious Broadway show about Mormons, "The Book of Mormon", works because of the thorough knowledge that the creators have of the <i>culture</i> of Mormonism.  It needles the culture (viciously), but it also displays love and respect.  These are two very successful works that look at a largely non-dominant religious culture.<br/><br/>Could a Mormon be pissed at "The Book of Mormon" or Dogs in the Vineyard? Absolutely.  Some have been. Could the creators of those works learn from those people's experiences? Yes. Could they both be "done better"? Naturally, nothing on this fallen Earth is perfect.  Are both works respectful of a minority religious culture? I believe they are, though the Broadway show also pokes fun and Dogs also contains a critique.  Are they damaging?  I do not believe so.  Is any of this contradictory? No. Hypocritical? Hardly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378029/#Comment_378029" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T22:27:58+00:00" title="May 12, 2012 10:27PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2012 10:30PM by UserClone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure that if you asked your average Mormon whether or not they'd like a show called <i>The Book of Mormon</i> to be written and produced by the South Park guys, more often than not you'd get a "No thanks, I'll pass."

If you then go "except that one...its ok to shit on them" then you've reduced everything you've said about respecting culture to hypocrisy...an argument that sounds good but which is really just being used to justify a particular agenda.</blockquote>\nIt's interesting to note that at least one model of ethical decision-making (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter_Box" rel="nofollow">Potter Box</a>) explicitly includes <i>loyalties</i> as a factor. You choose whose side you're on. Of course, that can be mitigated to some extent by the moral principles you embrace: Kant's <i>categorical imperative</i> ("Only do that which you are willing that everyone should do") or Rawls' <i>veil of ignorance</i> ("Decide as if you might end up on the short end of the stick") or even the Golden Rule ("Do unto others...")<br/><br/>In other words, one can decide that one's <i>obligations to</i> or <i>loyalties to</i> a particular group militate toward a particular decision. Notice that this means that there's no "view from nowhere"--every ethical decision is made by a particular decision-maker, not a generic one.<br/><br/>In any event, I think the notion that this is about "respect" for culture is a misnomer, implying as it does that unwillingness to give offense should be the driving force behind one's decisions. I am less afraid of offending people than I am of getting things wrong, either in the factual or the moral-aesthetic sense.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>So if we're writing a game about Saxons is it ok to appropriate from them when they were the dominant English culture, but its not ok to do a game about them after they'd been marginalized by the Normans...or before that the Danes?</blockquote>\nThis goes haring off in the wrong direction, asking exactly the wrong questions. The real question is, what do <i>you in particular</i> owe the Saxons, or the Danes? (Of course, once you pay him the Danegeld, you never get rid of the Dane). Arguably, what any of us minimally owe any historical time period is not to misrepresent it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>No...the dominant vs. marginalized distinction is IMO untenable and unnecessary. It is IMO an attempt to obfuscate the actual issue (<b>who is entitled to decide how a culture gets portrayed by others</b>) by obfuscating it with a lot of other issues...issues that are vital issues to discuss in their own right, but are totally tangential and a distraction from this one.</blockquote>\nBut that's not the actual issue! The actual issue is what are you personally obligated to do when you undertake to <i>represent</i> or <i>incorporate elements from</i> another culture in your work? No one else gets to decide for you--you have to decide for yourself. In this case "obeying the [copyright] law" is a <i>minimal</i> obligation.<br/><br/>I will grant you that there are those who will make it <i>seem</i> like the issue is that others have been trespassing on their cultural turf (As Chris Chinn says, <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2009/11/06/primitive-and-icy/" rel="nofollow">"Who gets to tell your story? Right?"</a>), but this is not quite right. It can't be, because that goes down the road of identity politics, which is pernicious.<br/><br/>So the issue of dominant versus marginalized is directly relevant to any given designer's decision-making, because you owe different things to the strong than to the weak (i.e., most moral codes to which people subscribe suggest that it's right to protect the powerless, unless you're Ayn Rand or something).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378044/#Comment_378044" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T03:32:15+00:00" title="May 13, 2012  3:32AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2012 3:37AM by Bill_White.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>I'm pretty sure that if you asked your average Mormon whether or not they'd like a show called <i>The Book of Mormon</i> to be written and produced by the South Park guys, more often than not you'd get a "No thanks, I'll pass."

You skip over a lot with your ellipsis. He starts off by framing <i>The Book of Mormon</i> as a caricature of <i>all religion</i>, not just Mormonism, and the bulk of the piece is an explanation of why, while members of other religions might be outraged over the musical (even a New York Jew! Imagine!), most Mormons are not.<br/><br/>Sure, he's pretty upfront with the idea that he's turning the other cheek, partly because it's a Christian imperative and partly to avoid seeming thin-skinned, but ultimately, "those thousands of remarkable and selfless Mormon missionaries [who served in Africa during the seven years Parker and Stone were working on their musical] . . . have returned home, bringing with them a connection with the African people that will last a lifetime. Many will keep up their Swahili language or their Igbo dialect. They will keep in their bedrooms the flags of the nations where they served. They will look up every time they hear Africa mentioned on the evening news. Their associations with the people whose lives they touched will become lifetime friendships.

The real question is, what do<i>you in particular</i>owe the Saxons, or the Danes? (Of course, once you pay him the Danegeld, you never get rid of the Dane). Arguably, what any of us minimally owe any historical time period is not to misrepresent it.</blockquote>\nI think that's exactly the right question, however, because it demonstrates how terms like Dominant and Marginalized are totally variable, changing, and meaningful only from the perspective of a particular agenda.   Your question is also a good one, and exactly the one that I think requires an objective way to approach answering it, which is what my window idea is attempting to do.<br/><br/>What do I in particular owe a culture?  Inside the window the answer is IMO "alot".  Outside the window the answer is IMO "nothing whatsoever" with the caveat that your answer of "not to misrepresent it" is not IMO an obligation to the culture itself (which no longer exists at that point) but then general obligation of accuracy and authenticity which is owed to the audience you're presenting to.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_Whiter</cite><br/>I will grant you that there are those who will make it<i>seem</i>like the issue is that others have been trespassing on their cultural turf (As Chris Chinn says,<a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2009/11/06/primitive-and-icy/" rel="nofollow">"Who gets to tell your story? Right?"</a>), but this is not quite right. It can't be, because that goes down the road of identity politics, which is pernicious.</blockquote>\nAnd that's exactly why I've been trying to develop an objective standard.  Because there is no way to avoid identity politics dominating the discussion when the cultures are recent / fresh / and attract avid defenders I think its important to have a window within with those politics are handled respectfully.

It is just as important for the weak to not demonize the strong with misrepresentation as it is for the strong to not demonize the weak.

In fact, I've been generally uninterested in 7th Sea because of issues with its continuity and history.  However, I don't think that everything has to conform to historical accuracy.  For example, I have run games inspired by The Princess Bride - set in similar fictional kingdoms of Europe in an unspecified time.  I included such things as stereotyped pirates who have nothing to do with the historical reality of piracy.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>In terms of respect, accurate portrayal, and not misrepresenting I think we owe exactly the same consideration to the strong as to the weak.

However, that's not the sticky point of disagreement.  The topic as I saw it was about works like Ganakogok, where the people aren't at all demonized.  However, they are associated with the Inuit without being an accurate portrayal of the Inuit.  <br/><br/>My approach is this:  I am OK with inaccurately portraying people as long as my target audience knows that the portrayal is inaccurate; and furthermore at least one of these: (1) my target audience has exposure to accurate portrayals of the people, or (2) the portrayal doesn't correspond to real-world stereotypes - and preferably both choices.  <br/><br/>So, for example, I don't have any problem with a stereotypical overbearing English aristocrat as a comedic character given that my players were familiar with English people and culture.  However, I might avoid having a pothead Rastafarian from Jamaica as a comedic character if my players weren't familiar with Caribbean culture - though I would be fine with an overbearing Jamaican aristocrat, since that isn't a real-world stereotype of Jamaicans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378104/#Comment_378104" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T15:05:03+00:00" title="May 13, 2012  3:05PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2012 4:48PM by Valamir.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I think your project of objectivity via a historical window is probably doomed to failure, because it falls apart in the face of those "avid defenders."

I think that most of the arguments I've heard made over the past week or so, here and especially on like a dozen G+ threads, are primarily "preaching to the choir" type arguments that aren't likely to move very many people...judging from the hostile reaction of several taking a contrary position to the way these arguments get presented...I feel pretty confident that the reaction of those people is far more indicative of the response of the general population than the majority of folks on this thread.<br/><br/>Point being, I think the question is less about how to get people on this thread (like Lee or Thomas) to agree that there is a time when its appropriate to be able to say..."sorry, that material is now public domain" then it is about how to get the masses to simply not have "fuck off" as their default position.  <br/><br/>That's where I see alot more utility in this sort of rigorous approach.  It cuts through the emotion, the politics, the social justice agenda, and just turns the issue into a very simple binary that ordinary people can use...just like how IP laws (are supposed to) work.  <br/><br/>"Is this work old enough to be public domain?" "No, then I better not use it in my work without getting permission"<br/>"Is this culture old enough to be public domain?"

This misses the obvious problem that Native culture is nowhere near dead, but also assumes that it is homogenous. We are many, and we are also very alive. We are a minority, and we rarely rise to the threshold of the consciousness of the masses, but we are definitely alive, and maintain our unique culture in the myriad ways that culture is defined.<br/><br/>To me this fact points out the most problematic aspect of your model Ralph. Even with your binary model of "fair game" vs. "protected property", the decision is not so simple, and still requires some engagement with the culture. Only by truly knowing the culture can you discern whether it is alive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378132/#Comment_378132" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T18:49:29+00:00" title="May 13, 2012  6:49PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I follow you Bill.

But I think I still have the same basic disagreement with it, because the IP analogy just doesn't jive with my experience.<br/><br/>If I were to translate my basic advice into an IP analogy, it would be: find out who will sue you for using their IP and then try to get permission from them so they don't sue you.<br/><br/>Because in my experience and my observations (which are not the same as anybody else's, of course), people don't actually care about IP law. A minority of people care about "being respectful," and the majority of people care about whether or not they will get sued. The law itself doesn't mean anything to people except for the possibility of getting sued.<br/><br/>With cultural appropriation, the only consequence is that people get mad and offended and express it (aside from personal guilt, which you're unlikely to feel without anybody being upset and expressing it). So, I see people being offended is the equivalent of being sued, and since I think people are way more concerned with being sued than following the letter of the law, that's why I say you should identify stakeholders and address yourself to them.<br/><br/>That's also why I don't see a cut-off date being of any use. Nobody can enforce this, and every cultural expression is going to engender a different sense of ownership in people. All the different groups of people who will "sue" you have their own ideas about when something no longer belongs to people.<br/><br/>Then again, your analogy also looks (to me, anyway) kinda like it's mostly an aid to deciding whether something is ethical or moral or not, and admittedly, I have no interest in that question.

The one omission in this discussion at this point is that, even having a rule laid out like this is a threat to and is offensive to "victims" of cultural appropriation. For those who have had their culture used and abused in disrespectful ways, especially by people who are ignorant of the issues surrounding their history and current difficulties, it seems to invite further appropriation. How are we to trust people to be respectful when they believe that they are under the protection of this rule's umbrella, especially when the rule seems to absolve them of any responsibility to engage with stakeholders because all you have to do is run an easy set of numbers? For those who have been the victim of many rules misuses throughout history, how does this rule protect them from significant disrespect and indignity in a way that just talking to them about how they feel would not do better? To make this rule work, you need to do your due diligence, which should include engaging with the culture and those who share it. I feel like this is a rule that will piss people off without gaining you anything meaningful.

I generally try to do what is right, not what some pressure group tries to get me to do by threats. This heuristic for figuring out what is appropriate seems like it does not care about doing right, only about obfuscating yourself so Internet pundits don't raise a fuzz about what you do. These last few posts between Ralph, Johnstone and Lee seem to advocate the idea that everything's OK as long as you can somehow dodge being attacked by some activists. Sort of like appropriating native American culture was OK until they organized and raised awareness enough to start complaining about it.<br/><br/>I could phrase this objection by saying that I don't "care about offending people", but as we've already discussed, that's not quite correct. However, there is a difference between endeavouring to do right and being afraid of complaints. I'll say that as regards the latter, I hope that I'll never be so weak as to sway from my course merely because some pressure group gets offended by my work.<br/><br/>This is probably another big preconception that makes this topic difficult to address: the kind of attitude I have makes it obvious that merely having somebody be offended about some work is nothing to me - the offense needs to be examined, turned into a moral argument and a conclusion drawn regarding the duties of the artist before I see a pressing need for the artist to care. The world is full of people who want to tell you what to do, and many of them have frivolous, misguided or evil goals; in this kind of world I can't in good conscience take something like "will Internet get angry?" as my guide to right action. In the meantime, it has been often said in this discussion that you cannot be the judge of your own action, you need to use certified minority voices to discover what is the moral course. I can see how this latter idea seems very close to "everything's OK as long as no native will complain", but I don't myself accept the equivalency: the reason for listening to a native voice, insofar as there is one, needs to be my own moral need to do right, not my own social need to avoid bad press. The latter is an empty principle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378146/#Comment_378146" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T00:33:19+00:00" title="May 14, 2012 12:33AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>It is not about us, Eero.</p>\n<p>We are fortunate to mostly live in places with some form of speech protection\u2014so that no matter whether or not the internet is angry we have the ability to say what we wish, to make that art that we wish.

No laws are being written\u2014the only repercussions we are likely to feel, short of violent revolution, is that some people won't like us if we make a choice they disagree with, and may say

I'm not dismissing any of it...just suggesting that there should be a time limit on it after which...there are no stakeholders to consult.  And I tried to avoid simply being arbitrary in the time limit, I actually outlined above exactly how I arrived at that limit...when no one is left alive who was actually born into the culture while it was being practiced, and no one is left alive who knew such a person.  That's pretty hard to track directly, but 180-200 years should be long enough to cover even the outlier cases.</blockquote>\nAnthropologists will say that there's no such thing as "pure" culture: that cultures are transformed by contact with each other--some in little ways, accreting over time; some dramatically, in huge and rapid shifts. But even in such instances, there will be those who are attempting to "practice" a culture, or "revive" it, or otherwise take an interest in or feel some stake in its representation, preservation, transmission, or dissemination. Thus my Monty Python reference above: "I'm not dead yet!" Who gets to decide that a culture is dead, in pursuit of the standard of objectivity you're seeking? This is why I think the attempt at objectivity in this instance is ultimately arbitrary and authoritarian; instead of saying <i>in every instance</i>, we should consider our obligations to those from whose culture we want to take bits and pieces to incorporate in our work, you're saying we should only do it some of the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378170/#Comment_378170" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T06:15:22+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  6:15AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>In the meantime, it has been often said in this discussion that you cannot be the judge of your own action, you need to use certified minority voices to discover what is the moral course. I can see how this latter idea seems very close to "everything's OK as long as no native will complain", but I don't myself accept the equivalency: the reason for listening to a native voice, insofar as there is one, needs to be my own moral need to do right, not my own social need to avoid bad press. The latter is an empty principle.</blockquote>\nSure, I gotcha. Here's the thing: If nobody tells you that your work is offensive, how will you know? I'm certainly not saying "everything's OK as long as nobody complains," nor am I trying to say you need to "placate" stakeholders and somehow make them go away. I'm also not here to tell you what is right, or moral, or ethical. How you sleep at night is your own business (although if my advise can help you, cool beans).<br/><br/>But people getting mad or simply telling you your work is hurtful is a manifestation and a demonstration of that hurt. That's how you know whether you have fulfilled your own moral need, assuming you want to "do right" by at least <i>somebody</i>, other than your own need for expression. If you want to capture somebody else's perspective, you need feedback from them to know whether you have achieved your goal or not.<br/><br/>And when I advise you to identify the stakeholders and address them, I don't mean you need to pacify or mollify them or cater to their whims. I'm saying you should <i>address</i> them, and their concerns. Make the effort to understand their position and state your case in a clear and direct manner that demonstrates that you have considered the situation and are informed enough about it that you have something meaningful to say.<br/><br/><br/>Like, say for example you make a game about 14th-century Serbia. Probably you don't care about offending Balkan nationalists who promote ethnic cleansing. That's cool, I'm not saying you should. But when the issue eventually comes up, what happens when you say "what? This is still an issue? I don't understand what you guys are talking about"? It makes you look like a guy writing about something he doesn't know much about. Or maybe you simply say "fuck those rapist motherfuckers, I'll write whatever I damn well please and if they don't like it they can suck it!" That makes you look like an asshole who is too lazy to know what is going on. You may not care about what nationalists think, but the ignorance and the flippant attitude of these responses will probably also offend people who experienced ethnic cleansing, people concerned about it, and other people you were hoping to communicate a different message to.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you address those concerns by saying "no, no, I did my research, here is what I think is going on with the historical situation of the Battle of Kosovo, and why I think it is important and interesting," and you lay that all out, and then you say why the nationalists have got it wrong, and why it has become politically poisonous, then you have done exactly what I have advised you to do (or that was my intent, anyway, apologies if that wasn't clear). That's addressing the stakeholders. It also demonstrates that you are a mature and informed author who has considered the issue and has something important to say about the subject matter.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378171/#Comment_378171" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T06:16:40+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  6:16AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, in the interests of clarifying my thoughts:<br/><br/>Ralph, I want to say that I respect the fact that you've considered this and spent time thinking about solutions.

It just occurred to me that you'd started to talk about what to me seemed about a point besides the point. It's probably because you've been criticizing Ralph's heuristic because it doesn't ensure that everybody will be mollified. Ralph's own idea, as I understood it, was not that waiting 200 years would ensure that everybody who might complain would be dead, but rather that anybody who might complain would not have a valid stake (from Ralph's viewpoint, I mean) on your work. In other words, it seems to me that he's taking a stand where your distress over a work of art is not in itself proof that something's wrong with the work. If I understand this correctly, then saying that his heuristic does not help you avoid public chastisement is meaningless - he's not trying to do that, he's trying to figure out a moral stand he's happy with himself.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I'm not convinced by Ralph's formulation either. Not only is the cut-off point of "when a culture dies" really hard to pin down, but also it has not been shown to my satisfaction that personal experience of a culture is somehow relevant in a person's right to be a stakeholder (in Johnstone's sense, a person who gets to expect that you'll engage him when making your work). I guess we could fix the first problem by declaring self-identification as sufficient, but then that standard is <i>never</i> going to be satisfied - I can't name a single ancient culture where there wouldn't be people out there who will quite sincerely name themselves as the living continuation and propagation of that culture.<br/><br/>As has been discussed, I'm not personally satisfied about cultural appropriation as a moral issue in the first place, but in the interest of considering the hypothetical, I'd say that it's not credible to build a set of standards on the age and supposed moribundness of culture. By all means prove me wrong, but to me it seems likely that the true moral duty on this issue is found in either caring about our fellow man as Liam's been arguing, or in some sort of duty towards truth and constructive progressive thinking, as has been hinted at here and there. Neither of these standards actually cares about the age and supposed moribundity of a culture: if somebody's hurt by your depiction of ancient Greek polis-dwellers, then that's an emotional fact, and if your goal was to avoid such hurt, the age of the culture in question doesn't come into it as far as I can see.<br/><br/>A standard that turns on the validity of a given person's self-identification as a member of a given culture (such as Ralph's), or one that gauges cultures on the basis of their political high-score (as suggested by those who think it's OK to bash on Christianity) - both of those seem to me pretty incredible, as I don't see off-hand how a moral imperative follows from either kinds of evaluation. If somebody's really rooting for either of these, I'd be interested in seeing the train of thought sketched out in simple terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378190/#Comment_378190" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T07:56:05+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  7:56AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2012 7:57AM by Johnstone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>to me it seems likely that the true moral duty on this issue is found in either caring about our fellow man as Liam's been arguing, or in some sort of duty towards truth and constructive progressive thinking, as has been hinted at here and there.

And with that in mind, it's amusing you mention polis dwellers. My Ancient Greek is pretty bad, but I <i>did</i> spend the time and effort to learn it, to study the literature, the history, and the historiography, and even travel to Greece to do so. I wouldn't say I'm <i>offended</i> by like, the use of Greek gods for even crass commercialization or ass-fucking jokes or anything, but I definitely appreciate when the subject matter's done right. But I don't feel that as an abstract principle or anything, it feels like a connection to other people, both living and dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378223/#Comment_378223" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T09:57:22+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  9:57AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>to me it seems likely that the true moral duty on this issue is found in either caring about our fellow man as Liam's been arguing,.</blockquote>\nIn the interests of full disclosure, I will say that I didn't originally come up with this idea.

If somebody's really rooting for either of these, I'd be interested in seeing the train of thought sketched out in simple terms.</blockquote>\nI think I've established my position to the extent it has value to do so.  I'll add this comment only because Eero has specifically requested my train of thought.<br/><br/>I don't consider self-identification in a culture to have any validity.  Having ownership rights in a culture is not something IMO one can just choose to have because they feel like it, any more than a person can self-identify as the owner of a tree, or a car, or a bag of chips.  Ownership rights have rules, you either are or aren't an owner, and there are specific ways to become an owner.  And just like you can't simply wake up one day and decide you own my car, I can't simply wake up one day and decide I have an ownership stake in 15th century Finnish Culture.<br/><br/>To me a culture exists in a specific time and a specific geography and is closely tied to the families (or family proxies) who lived in that time and that place and passed down the elements of that culture.  If you lived in that time and in that place you have an ownership interest in that culture.  If you didn't, you don't, and self identifying that you do IMO doesn't make it so.<br/><br/>I also don't accept that culture is a long extended thing that exists continuously throughout time (see my earlier evolution example).  I grew up in North East, Pennsylvania; USA in the 70s and 80s.  That's my culture.  My culture was built on the culture of North East, Pennsylvania; USA from the 50s and 60s...but that's not my culture.  That culture was the culture of the 50s and 60s...I wasn't alive then, it doesn't belong to me...it belongs to my parents.  Because of the role my parents had in my life their culture was essential to mine, and so one can argue I have a stake in it...and a lesser stake in my grandparents' culture...and a lesser stake yet in my great grandmother's culture (but I only ever knew 1 of my great parents and none of my great great grandparents...so no...IMO I don't have a stake in those.  <br/><br/>The idea that this is somehow all part of the same culture...that somehow I have ownership rights on the whole history of North East, Pennsylvania going back to its founding in 1794 I think is Ludicrous with a capital L.  The demographics were not the same, the industry was not the same, how people spent their time was not the same, how they worshiped was not the same...that's not even touching on technology and politics.  Sure we have plaques commemorating old historical events, and old maps in the court house and old dates on old buildings and streets named after old families (and some of those family names can still be found in the phone book).  But no...that's not the same culture.  Maybe my culture is descended from that culture...but its not the same culture, and trying to claim it is would be ridiculous.<br/><br/>So that's my train of thought.  You own what you actually own...you don't have a right to claim ownership to something that existed and was gone before you were ever born, or your parents were born, or your grandparents were born.  If you don't even know anyone who'd been born in that culture...it's no longer your culture.  And once its no longer your culture...you can self identify all you want and make all kinds of grandiose claims...but to me...such claims hold pretty much no weight...and nor should they.  I can't even comprehend the idea that some have expressed above that cultures don't die...of course they die.  And at the pace of the modern world they die faster than ever.  American culture has changed so dramatically in just the last 12 years that I'd argue its very damn near a completely different culture today than it was in just the year 2000.  Maybe that's a bit of hyperbole...but it damn sure is a completely different culture today than it was in 1984 when I was 13.  In 1984 we were worried about the Soviets and Cold War and terrorism.  Terrorism was something that happened in Europe and making a phone call away from home involved feeding dimes into a phone booth with a rotary dial. <br/><br/>Why I think this is important is because I don't think a person has the right to control or exert pressure on how art should be created on a culture that isn't theirs...no matter how much they self identify that it IS.  Self identifying means nothing to me.  People are still going to do it...they're still going to try to exert such pressure...but that doesn't mean they have the right to do so...and IMO when they don't have the right to do so then what they are expressing is no more than their personal opinion and preference.  And it can be accepted and accounted for exactly the same as accepting and accounting for any personal opinion and preference...acted on...or ignored as the artist chooses. <br/><br/>So the outline that I've been discussing in this thread is my current working model on how to establish when someone actually has the right to talk about a culture and exert influence on how art depicts that culture because they are a legitimate owner/stakeholder in it, and when such efforts are just their personal opinion and can be acted on or ignored freely without the additional gravity of larger cultural issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378332/#Comment_378332" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T22:16:57+00:00" title="May 14, 2012 10:16PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2012 10:43PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do y'all think this would work?

I think it has some validity if you attempt to be objective. There is a danger in going for a "whoever is most offended wins" morality. That said, not wanting to offend people is an entirely different argument and a lot of great stuff has been said about it here. You guys are awesome.<br/><br/>2: I think something that needs to be pointed out here is that if you're being respectful and trying to do it right, incorporating things from marginalized cultures is a good thing. It's easy to get the impression from these discussions that I'm better off just making a safe game and not include anything from these cultures. But if you're trying to make it right, what you're doing is popularizing, spreading awareness and informing people about the marginalized culture, and that's a good thing. These cultures are often small in number and if they were the only ones who could incorporate their culture in art, they'd pretty much disappear in the flood of mainstream culture from the masses. And because of assimilation, many of the members of the culture don't feel much pride in their heritage, either, which makes it even more threatened with exclusion. So when I see stuff like "I was gonna include this stuff in my game but decided not to because I don't want to appropriate culture", it makes me sad, because excluding isn't a good thing, either. As long as you try to do it right and you're honest about it, including elements of marginalized cultures in your game is a good thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378353/#Comment_378353" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T02:21:15+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  2:21AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>1) Make your game's culturally sensitive material publicly available prior to commercial release.</blockquote>\nI don't think I would know what is "culturally sensitive". Is it just any material that relates to cultures that are or have been (non-white heterosexual male) minorities in the USA at some point in the country's history?

If you were writing a game about, say, the American Revolution in the 18th century, what are the criteria that you would use for yourself to know that you'd done a good job in the game?  Would your criteria change if your game was about the Middle Passage instead?  Are they different criteria from if you wanted to write a game about being an American in Pennsylvania in 1975?</blockquote>\nThat would depend on what my design goal for the game was.  If I was doing a silly Sons of Liberty-esque game ala Josh Roby, no ones opinion would really matter in respect of this thread...because doing a good job in the sense of getting it right isn't really a goal...and the period is well outside the window.   If I was doing a serious historical game on the American Revolution I'd consult historical sources that a) I felt were historically accurate and b) provided the information I needed for the specific agenda of the game...which may emphasize some aspects and deemphasize others.  If Eero wanted to design such a game, my hope (as an appreciator of historical accuracy) would be that he'd consult similar sources in an effort to get it right.  If he didn't and was sloppy about it I would criticize him on those grounds, but I would not criticize him on the grounds of cultural appropriation because the culture of the American Revolution now belongs as much to him in Finland as it does to me in America. <br/><br/>The Middle Passage would still be within my current working window definition, at least for another few decades, so I wouldn't be doing a Sons of Liberty-esque game around it, as its not my culture to approach from a silly perspective.   A game designer wanting to take such an approach today, would be well served by following the advice on this thread and being well aware of the sensitive nature of the ground they were treading on.<br/><br/>But if a game designer 100 years from now wanted to do a gonzo action silly romp of a game where the Amistad was a giant Steam Mecha and the slaves took it over and went stomping around the Caribbean...they should be able to do so with no more effort to research than consulting the future equivalent of wikipedia.  People could still criticize it as a crappy game (personal opinion) but it would be unjust IMO to criticize it on the grounds of Cultural Appropriation or Insensitivity because enough time had passed that that period of history would then be owned by the entire world to be spindled folded and mutilated as desired. <br/><br/>If I were doing a game set in WASP Pennsylvania in 1975, to some extent I could rely on myself as a source or people I know, although I'd have much better direct knowledge of 1985.  But again, who's opinion would depend on what I was trying to do.  If I were just doing a silly little riff on Dazed and Confused, I would feel free to spindle, mutilate, and fold as desired because though its within the window...its MY culture and as such I have the right to treat it as I please.  <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Pettersson</cite>1: I think that Ralph's point that the culture I live in today is not the same culture that my forefathers lived in is central to his viewpoint and has been misunderstood by many in this thread. I think it has some validity if you attempt to be objective. There is a danger in going for a "whoever is most offended wins" morality. That said, not wanting to offend people is an entirely different argument and a lot of great stuff has been said about it here. You guys are awesome.</blockquote>\nYes, this.  Whatever culture a person is living in today, and however dedicated they are to preserving yesterday, reenacting yesterday, remembering yesterday...its not yesterday.  Standing in 2012 and trying to preserve the culture of ones ancestors from 1832, is not the same as the culture those ancestors lived in 1832.  Its different.  The 2012 culture of remembering 1832 is its own thing...separate and distinct from the 2012 culture of not giving a shit about 1832, and valuable in and of itself.  But it is not the culture of 1832.  The culture of 1832 is dead and gone and lives on only in memory...which is NOT the same thing as living on.   The people in 1832 weren't trying to remember or preserve 1832...they were living it...as casually and as naturally as we live 2012.  There is no one alive today who lives 1832 as casually and as naturally as the people of 1832 lived it...or (I highly suspect) knows anyone who lived that way in 1832...thus the culture of 1832 is gone...dead...past...no longer here. <br/><br/>Standing in 2012 and claiming that a culture from 1832 is being maintained today...by typing that claim on a keyboard over the internet...sorry...I'm not buying that for a second.  No culture that actively uses cell phones and the internet can make a legitimate claim to being the same culture as a pre cell/internet culture.  The transformative effects of those technologies have changed culture far too dramatically for any such claim to hold any merit.  Similarly...automobiles and the interstate system (and its global counter parts), the printing press, steam power...are all technologies that bright line separate one culture from another.  The post technology cultures may be descendants from and inheritors of pre technology cultures...but they are NOT the same culture.   Period.  Such a model would probably provide a degree more precision and accuracy than my simpler time limit, but not enough so in most applications that its worth the extra effort, although I'm open to the possibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378406/#Comment_378406" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T08:31:47+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  8:31AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a very specific example, I was born on Barrabool nation, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Barrabool" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Barrabool</a>) over a hundred years after the last national of Barabool died. Some of the neighboring nations are very active, and there is an indigenous cultural center across town, and another down the road, but they are focused on an existing and living culture. Personally I can hold a good conversation about a lot of aspects of indigenous culture, though I am *not* recognized as a member. I have been asked my opinion by a lot of well respected persons, either traditional land owners, or representatives of cultural practice. I have even been known to help with a right answer or two (usually just mentioning whom could answer the question better).<br/><br/>PS Wikipedia is not 100% correct here, as they are talking about a white shire not the traditional boundries.<br/><br/>Since the Barrabool traded culture and mixed bloodlines, are the neighboring nations considered to be the authority?

That is, you think of yourself as a modern individual, and that while your beliefs and customs were influenced and shaped by your childhood, the real importance of those beliefs and customs are that they are the ones you personally have right now, today, in your actual life. You don't feel any need to define yourself by or shape your identity around something that happened before you were born.<br/><br/>That's kind of how I feel about my own cultural background -- I'm aware of my family history going back a few generations, but I don't have any allegiance to or affinity for the countries my ancestors came from, or feel like I need to observe the same holidays as they did, or cook the same food, or learn my ancestors' languages or even identify myself to other people as a descendant of the half-dozen European countries I could claim heritage from, or whatever. That sort of thing has no real appeal to me, so I don't make it part of my own sense of identity. And that's pretty easy for me to do, since all my connections to that family history are indirect and somewhere around a century ago, and so as far as I'm concerned, it's got nothing at all to do with my life or who I am. My culture looks like the mainstream, modern American culture, and I fit into it just fine. I don't feel like anyone cares where I came from or where my parents' parents came from, and so I am free from having to care about that, too: no one is going to look at me and think, "Oh, he's German/Irish/Bulgarian/whatever, how <i>exotic</i>," no one is going to ask me what race I am or what nationality I am, no one is going to give me a weird look when they ask where my family came from and I say, "Michigan."<br/><br/>One of the interesting things about this thread to me is getting to see the other side of that coin, and get an inkling of why someone who is NOT like me would have excellent, compelling reasons to care about where their family came from, and why they would want to feel connected to it, and especially why they would want to protect and preserve it. I feel like I can get away with not giving a shit about my great-grandparents, because everything about the culture I'm immersed in makes it easy for me to feel that way...but that's so clearly not true for everyone, and it shouldn't be: people preserving, observing, honoring, and defending their cultural identities is important. Also admirable, and enriching, and -- here is where I think you and I differ -- not something that has anything at all to do with <i>what year it is</i>. If you're invested in your family history, you are invested in it; it doesn't have to be 1832 and you don't have to live like it is for you to value and feel connected to the way your 19th-century relatives lived. And if someone from outside your culture dismisses not only your connection to that heritage, but actually tells you that you have no right to claim that connection or to complain if they do some damage to it through misrepresentation or outright disrespect? Even I, the mainstreamiest member of the American mainstream, can disagree with that argument.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378539/#Comment_378539" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T16:47:49+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  4:47PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, in general, it's a lot easier to feel relaxed about your culture being misappropriated when it's all over the place, often being treated respectfully or being held up as normal or normative. No-one is going to draw conclusions about all white people from Paris Hilton or Bill Gates, because they get to see lots of complicating counterexamples on a daily basis in all forms of mainstream media and culture. But if you're Native American, odds are there are a lot fewer people out there representing your culture, so every misuse is that much more significant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378552/#Comment_378552" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T18:31:25+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  6:31PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>"The law, in its majesty, forbids both rich and poor from sleeping under bridges and begging for bread."</blockquote>\nThis cuts to the core. The circumstances faced by each are not the same, so a rule will affect them differently, even though each COULD be affected, if their circumstances were the same.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Pettersson</cite>So when I see stuff like "I was gonna include this stuff in my game but decided not to because I don't want to appropriate culture", it makes me sad, because excluding isn't a good thing, either. As long as you try to do it right and you're honest about it, including elements of marginalized cultures in your game is a good thing.</blockquote>\nThis is true. I would never have a blanket "hands off" rule. I am more than happy to share, as can be seen in my history here. I think most people who have the potential to become offended by these sorts of situations would be happy to share. And I will even be civil and respectful in my criticism of those I feel are misrepresenting or perpetuating hurtful memes should the need arise. Most hurtful memes are a result of ignorance, and I prefer to work on helping people to overcome ignorance. That only happens in a climate of respect.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Whatever culture a person is living in today, and however dedicated they are to preserving yesterday, reenacting yesterday, remembering yesterday...its not yesterday.  Standing in 2012 and trying to preserve the culture of ones ancestors from 1832, is not the same as the culture those ancestors lived in 1832.</blockquote>\nThis has a high potential to be wrong. I will not say with absolute certainty that it is, but there is a really good chance that it is wrong. If this idea has no room for the reality that my eagle feathers mean the same thing to me as they did to my great grandfather who passed them down to me, if this idea has no room for the reality that my sweats and my vision quest have the same meaning to me as it did to my father, and his father, and the unnamed great-great-great grandfather in my ancestry, if this idea has no room for the fact that the stories I tell my children mean the same thing to me as they did to my ancestors when they told them to each other in Mississippi prior to the Trail of Tears, if this idea has no room for the fact that the reverence I feel for the corn I grow or the deer I shoot or the fish I catch as my ancestors felt in Indian Territory, then it is totally wrong. <br/><br/>This idea seems to assume that "culture" has to always include every aspect of life of every person alive at a certain time. This is not true. There are things that are maintained, not for history's sake, but for the intrinsic value in them. They are maintained because that is how people do things. My ancestors danced because that is what they did, AND for the sake of their ancestors. I dance for my ancestors, and this can be likened to some sort of historical preservation, but this is not why I do it. I do it because that is what I do, what my family does, as part of my culture, my living culture. This is not historical preservation for preservations' sake. Preservation is a byproduct of the fact that this is something that we do. I do it for the spiritual connection I get from knowing that I come from this direct line, this thing that is bigger than just me, this thing that transcends time. This thing makes me immortal in a sense, as I am but a part of a much larger whole. It is the very fact that you try to separate a person from their history that is the huge disconnect for me. You may not feel the connection to your past that I do, but denying that there is no connection, no present and important element of lineage and the past in anyone, and that there is no need to respect this connection will leave me unable to agree with you. It is also the reason that the Yakima are offended that a museum holds the bones of a man dug up on Yakima land. The Yakima are not the only ones offended. Many people will be offended when historical context is ignored. To disrespect someones history is disrespectful of all who value their own history. This is the morass and mire that you will encounter should this rule ever come into play.<br/><br/>Any model that cannot account for the fact that some people do the same things that their ancestors did more than 180+ years ago is not accounting for reality, and any model that ignores the importance that many people hold for their own history and ancestry is not accounting for reality.<br/><br/>And again, even if this model did work the way it is intended, I have yet to hear of an example where it could be applied. So, what is the point? At this point it just seems like a model without possible practical application that is an insult to people who are not disconnected from their past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16475/ganakagok-cultural-appropriation-and-the-new-world/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16475/ganakagok-cultural-appropriation-and-the-new-world">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16475/ganakagok-cultural-appropriation-and-the-new-world/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16475/ganakagok-cultural-appropriation-and-the-new-world/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16475/ganakagok-cultural-appropriation-and-the-new-world/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16475%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16475%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
