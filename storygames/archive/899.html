                    Okay, so here's the blog article:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.thesmerf.com/blog/48-mediums-trying-to-find-application<br/>
<br/>
I figure it's going to wind up here sooner or later.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a game where the Kabalah formed a significant part of the gameworld.  One of the things Kabalists do is take the letters that make up a passage of scripture, add up all the digits, and assign secret meaning based on the total.<br/>
<br/>
What if you made a bot that added up the total of everything posted in the IC channel, and posted the results in the OOC channel?  What if that number then had meaning in the game?  <br/>
<br/>
Singles and tens digits would be a "randomizer" used for resolving any action attempted.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds and thousands digits would change the 'game space' in various ways, perhaps making particular magical influences wax and wane as play proceeds.<br/>
<br/>
Hm... ten digits, ten sephiroth on the Tree of Life.<br/>
<br/>
There's something in there.                </div>

                            Such a bot, or one close to it, already exists. Check out . . . I think it's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23thelema&amp;Mode=like">#thelema</a> on either undernet or efnet, maybe both. If you ask nice I wager they'll give you a copy--plenty of gamers in there, since as we all know, <i>gaming leads to occultism . . . and eventual MADNESS!!!</i> The bot will do both Hebrew and Greek gematria (the summing up of the numeric values of letters you're talking about). Oh, in Greek, this trick is called <i>stoichea</i>.<br/><br/>You'd have to modify the bot to get it to take "all text so far" instead of "this chunk here I'm now asking you to gematrify."                        </div>

                            Thanks for the connection, JB.  I'll store that away.  Before I go there, I think I need to have a draft of some game rules first.<br/>
<br/>
The game is played in turns.  Each player in the channel gets to speak once before anyone gets to speak twice.  When anyone makes a posting to the IC channel, it gets evaluated according to a numerological scheme that is unique to that game instance, randomly generated by the 'bot when the game is initiated.  Each contribution must contain a resolution of the previous contribution (if there is one) and an initiation of a new question.  A contribution must contain at least 30 letters to be legal, and must fit in a single IRC line.<br/>
<br/>
Numerological schemes contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30...90, 100, 200, 300, ... 700.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands digit is INTENSITY.  This controls how much magic is available for the next action.  Any points of intensity which are not used are carried over, and available to the next player.  Intensity points are spent making magic last longer, cover a larger area, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The hundreds digit is REALM.  This delineates which sphere of influence is ascendant in the next action.  If the next action is magical, it must be part of this sphere of influence.  Here's a first crack at the concepts that could go in this category:<br/>
<br/>
0. - Nullification, Emptiness,<br/>
1. - Activation, Creation<br/>
2. - Duality, splitting, division<br/>
3. - Improvement, Refinement<br/>
4. - Ego, physicality, the world<br/>
5. - Healing, Growth<br/>
6. - New Ideas, Vision<br/>
7. - Perfection, Completion<br/>
8. - Infinity, Eternity<br/>
9. - Cyclicality, Karma, Destiny<br/>
<br/>
The tens digit is FORTUNE.  This digit determines the success or failure of the action that was taken in the contribution, and guides the next contribution.<br/>
<br/>
The ones digit is unused at this time, since it is the easiest to manipulate.  I may think of a use for it in the future.                        </div>

<blockquote>Hm... ten digits, ten sephiroth on the Tree of Life.</blockquote>
... also known as the Fingers of God.<br><br>I suggest that you do some actual seeking for this kind of thing. I mean, this isn't a fantasy religion or anything. Judaism is practiced by real Jews. This is kinda like playing jacks with crucifices.<br><br>(I'm by no means saying that you shouldn't use kabalah in your games or whatever. But these things have meanings, traditions, and emotional weight and aren't just fun color.)<br><br>---<br><br>What's neat about this idea is that it's really gameable. Magic words will work as a direct part of the system and be hugely flexible, with bizarre consequences for miscalculation.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm drawing inspiration without making copies.  And yeah... I studied the Hermetic shadows of Kabbalah for a while.  So I know that it's not considered a good idea to fool around with the Real Thing in some circles.                        </div>

                            Hm, astrological influences... ephemerides...  no, not yet, too early for that kind of elaboration.  Keep it simple for now.<br/>
<br/>
It is a convocation of magi.  At this time, the planets are aligned.  In this place, tradition and ritual have power.<br/>
<br/>
As the game begins, all is dark, except for the eternal flame that marks the center of of the space, and the basin of water around it in which the world can be observed.  One by one, the magi enter the space.  Each player first makes his entrance, describing the means by which the mage arrives, and what he looks like when he gets there.  <i>These descriptions serve to charge the INTENSITY battery, and establish the turn order; whoever contributes the most to the battery gets to go first, with ties broken randomly by the bot.</i><br/>
<br/>
Next, in order, each player describes the group that the mage represents.  It is by this means that the players collectively establish what is meaningful about the world.    <i>This play establishes a PILLAR, something that is important to the people the mage represents, something they either lack and want to gain, or something they have and want to improve.</i> </div>
