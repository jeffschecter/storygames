Complex Characterizations<br/>2. Confrontation<br/>3. Careening<br/>4. Coronary<br/>- the most writerly suggestion: do actor-style sense memory to call on emotional moment in your life analogous to what is taking place in the fiction<br/>- I have asked ahead of time for player memories about incidents sharing the Color that I intended in introduce in a campaign<br/>5. Communication<br/>- again, a bit about what goes on in the writer's head rather than what goes on the page<br/>- this passage seemed useful:<br/>"Here\u2019s an exercise I call \u201cThe Dickens\u201d (named for Charles and his time-traveling story A Christmas Carol): Go forward in time 20 years after your story ends. Your lead character is now 20 years older and has had time to reflect on all that happened in the story you told. You\u2019re now a reporter, and you track down the character and ask, \u201cLooking back at everything that happened to you, why do you think you had to go through that? What life lesson did you learn that you can pass on to the rest of us?\u201d<br/>In a saga game, like Saga of the Icelanders, or a mythic/epic/Glorantha or Avalon Heroquest game this would be an actual closing moment. In a Sorcerer and Sword a character with a Destiny or Fate could bring dice into a present action by incorporating that future retrospection.<br/><br/>These could easily be turned into Techniques.<br/><br/>But could they be made System?<br/>- Shock has shown the role that conflict matricies can have in generating the Shared Imaginative Space and in linking Setting and Premise to mechanics.<br/>- Confrontation provides a suggestion on how to deal with mechanizing conflict: give me that crunch which facilitates a thriller-like logic of decision making and risk taking. I make commander-level decisions in a Burning Wheel firefight, with occasional fractal break outs of the complexities of individual shots. Can a thriller game give that play experience, but more of the "super-competent agent trying to outdo a rival in a limited-space, heavy fog-of-battle, suspense-laden kind of way" (new acronym:ScATtOaRiaLsHfobSlKoW).<br/>- Sorcerer has the three techniques for invoking story-now decision making: Cross, Weave, Opening. I can see that sending things "Careering" being a technique that could be added to that cluster. A radical twist that, like The Tilt in Fiasco, gives the whole Situation a shake. FATE discussions also invoke the Chandler principle: When things slow down, bring in a man with a gun." Would there be any way to mechanize such tilting in a thriller game, especially one where some detailed and confusing behind-the-scenes conspiracy is unfolding?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432476/#Comment_432476" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-12T18:55:09+00:00" title="May 12, 2014  6:55PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting!

One might even imagine it as a "GM Move".<br/><br/>Running with that idea and plugging in the notion of <i>Rising Action</i> and <i>Falling Action</i> (cf. Brenda Laurel), one might even glimpse a game structure in which one player or set of players represents <i>Rising Action</i> (introduction of new or unconnected nodes/data, tension between nodes, lack of interpellation, mystery increasing) while another represents <i>Falling Action</i> (connection of loose nodes/data, organization into meaningful structures, defusing or resolving tension between nodes, mystery decreasing).<br/><br/>[Actually this is kinda similar to the structure I employed in "Watch the World Die", where each player has to choose which "side" he will play on each turn: either "increasing the pressure" or "relieving it".]<br/><br/>But turning this sort of dynamic structure into a system for telling suspense tales?  That sounds like <i>your</i> job. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432513/#Comment_432513" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T06:49:39+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  6:49AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2014 6:55AM by Rickard.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My perspective of the article is that games normally have effort, uncertainty, decision and investment to play around with. In books and movies, you cannot have any effort or decision (but where movies like Memento or Irrversible beg to differ). So what you can play around with is uncertainty and investment. Where a lot of roleplaying game designers rely (for me, too heavily) on dice as uncertainty, I think we can learn from other mediums in how they handle it.\n<blockquote>Complex Characterizations: Is your protagonist all good? /.../ These roiling conflicts make her survival an open question.</blockquote>\nI saw Elysium yesterday and it even if the setting was thrilling, the movie was boring to me. Why? Because I could spot from miles ahead how the character were going to react. This is why so many action-movies can come out as boring to me because the protagonist is good and will always act in a certain way.<br/><br/>Having a ambivalent background creates more possible outcomes, and creates uncertainty for the reader. The videogame The Last of Us does this really good, where the protagonist is a selfish bastard.\n<blockquote>Careening: There\u2019s nothing like a stunning twist /.../ Forcing your writer\u2019s mind to deal with conundrums is a great practice. But there is another way. /.../ ask yourself: \u201cWhat would a reader expect to happen next?" /.../ Then /.../ do something different.</blockquote>\nHere is another way of creating uncertainty. This wont work well for some playstyles, where you improvise a story together, because it's in most times better to say the first thing that comes into mind than trying to create something out of the ordinary. The longer you think about something, the worse the result tend to be. However, if you're creating a plot on beforehand, like in trad gaming, this can work out well.\n<blockquote>Confrontation: More interesting confrontations come from a villain who is justified in what he does.</blockquote>\nThis may look like uncertainty, and conflicts are certainly so in roleplaying games, but this is actually about investment. The longer you spend on something, the more you come to understand, and the more invested you become in that person. Again, in the video game The Last of Us, you come to understand why the antagonist is a selfish bastard and can accept that.\n<blockquote>Coronary: The best thrillers stab the heart, /.../ concentrate on recalling an emotional moment in your life, and recreate each of the senses in your memory /.../ and transferred those emotions to the page.</blockquote>\nTrying to make the reader feel for the character: investment.\n<blockquote>Communicating: /.../ In short, what will the reader take away from your book? /.../  theme (or meaning, or premise).</blockquote>\nThis is investment with a hint of uncertainty. As the investment grows, by the reader spending time with it, and the story unravels, an awareness will rise about the character. You can either bring this awareness to a closure or leave it open for questions. Some books and movies does both, like how L\xe5t den r\xe4tte komma in (Let the Right One In) may seem like a closure but there are many interpretations if it's a happy or sad ending (the American version missed this aspect). The Last of Us brings a closure but one that will upset the player. Movies like Memento and The Man from Earth let you think during the movie, but also leaves things unsaid so, at least, I continued to think about the questions after those movies.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I'm not dumbing the author's list down to two points: uncertainty and investment. What I want to show is in how many different ways that you can create these.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
