For example the right-hand side of <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/4479-325c-520a025e-af7b-12420a008e8e/0" rel="nofollow">this chart</a>, titled "You want to say something". Or in <a href="http://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/65811" rel="nofollow">this answer</a> on RPG StackExchange.<br/><br/>Looking at the moves, they seem to me to only make sense in situations with stakes. This makes sense - that's what Dungeon World is focused on. Situations where there isn't much at stake are skipped over; they aren't part of the story. I think this excludes some things that I consider a normal part of fantasy roleplaying. Which is fine! I was just surprised not to see people discussing DW saying "So you can't do X", or "Here is how you would handle X".<br/><br/><b>Example 1: Talking to an NPC for flavour / roleplaying</b><br/>It's quite common for my players to engage an NPC in conversation and banter. We'll probably find out something about the world while we do, it and both the PCs and the NPCs get fleshed out by it. Sometimes, my NPCs will reveal problems, or opportunities, that lead on to more stuff, but sometimes it's just chat.<br/><br/>Looking at my GM moves list, it seems that if someone talks to an NPC, I need to at least be presenting an opportunity (with or without a cost), if not putting them in a spot, or revealing an unwelcome truth. There's no "just conversation" - everything spring boards into stakes. Is this correct? (To reiterate, that's fine if so, just trying to understand).<br/><br/><b>Example 2: Mechanisms in dungeons</b><br/>Quite often we have setups in dungeons that require experimentation and exploration to understand. "I see, when we pull *this* lever that thing moves. So maybe if we go back to the other room and press the button again the door will open". Here the GM is just describing the natural results of interacting with bits of some in-game system. There's no price to failure, unless there is a time limit, or some of the results of interacting with the mechanism are dangerous.<br/><br/>Looking at my GM moves list, I can't see a "describe the simple result of an interaction" move. I assume I again need to be putting them in a spot, show signs of an approaching threat, etc.<br/><br/>So am I correct that DW wants you to skip over these things to get to stakes? Or is there a way of doing these things with the moves? Or am I wrong that the only thing that the GM can do is use a move?<br/><br/>(I am as ever grateful for the time people on these forums give to my questions - I'm aware I ask a lot more than I answer! Additionally, I will be travelling the next few weeks, so I may only able to read replies and post short answers, like 'thanks!')                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447870/#Comment_447870" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-11T09:01:33+00:00" title="August 11, 2015  9:01AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You make the move on a 6- or when everyone looks at you expectantly.<br/>The rest of the time you just portray a dangerous and fantastic world.<br/><br/>For the levers, the move there is \u201dexploit your prep\u201d.

What's Dungeon World Like to Play section right at the beginning explicitly says that you have that back and forth you're used to about the fiction until a move is triggered/relevant. And if you look in the How to GM section, it outlines the GM's duty to describe the situation, which can easily include ongoing behaviors and conversations AND is the foremost answer to your second question - it's your job to describe the fiction and the players react and so forth. If your conversation doesn't trigger moves, it continues as it seems you're accustomed.<br/><br/>When re-reading these sections, really focus on Agenda and Principles, but there are more things that can give depth to the answers to your questions. For one, the rules for fleshing out towns and resources can be essential to informing those interactions with NPCs instead of leaving them completely up to whimsy. Another thing to keep in mind is that the standard GM section and the Advanced Delving section explains the process of making new moves that might be relevant if not essential to creating the mechanism interactivity you're talking about - and providing a push as well.<br/><br/>A big thing to consider is that even if you provide all of this, players can basically bypass those fictional physics puzzles using Discern Realities and Spout Lore. Not only can they, but I think they should because, as the Agenda section of the book explains, that's not really what the game is about. Keep in mind that doesn't mean that moves like that just defy reason - moves spring forward from and resolve in the fiction, itself. That's also why you might want to make custom moves: to highlight a particular way your world works.<br/><br/>Edit: That link about traps is great. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447878/#Comment_447878" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-11T10:46:41+00:00" title="August 11, 2015 10:46AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2015 10:46AM by hamnacb.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GM Moves are realizations of Principles which are also the realizations of Agendas.

Cool! This makes more sense to me, but I was getting such a strong message of "Just look at your moves and make one" I was trying to second guess my assumptions. Of course, even if you are not making a move, but just describing the situation, we need to stick to the agenda and principles, or this is no longer Dungeon World.<br/><br/>So here's a more concrete example, to double check. This is an idea I'd had generally for a dungeon recently, and I was pondering whether it would work in Dungeon World.<br/><br/>The set up is that there is big vertical shaft in the dungeon, with a corridor leading in at the bottom and another leading out at the top. People can move up or down the shaft in a boat by pulling levers to fill or drain the shaft with water.* It's important to drain the shaft before opening the airlock at the bottom, and to close the airlock before filling the shaft, or the lower levels of the dungeon will be flooded.<br/><br/>It's quite simple. It's deterministic. But I think it's interesting because if the PCs interact with it wrongly they may flood the dungeon (triggering all kinds of changes in the factions that live there), they may themselves be swept away (Make them backtrack). Alternatively, they may choose to deliberately flood things as part of a plan.<br/><br/>Could I present this as a situation in Dungeon World? <br/><br/>Does there need to be something urgent at stake. For example, "As you open the massive metal door, you find yourself at the bottom of a massive circular shaft, carved out of the stone by the long ago axes of the dwarves, and floored with a metal grill. From above, you can hear the sounds of a ritual reaching its peak. It is the voice of the cultists! The shaft is featureless, lacking staircases or ladders, save for a lever on the wall. What do you do?" Then, when they took actions that took time, or failed rolls, I might progress the ritual, possibly to irrevocable consequences (a hard move) if they took too long. <br/><br/>Or is it okay to sometimes have things at a gentler pace? Present the shaft just a puzzling part of a dungeon that it - currently - a quiet place.<br/><br/>I think this is a plausible interpretation of the agenda, assuming that your group agrees that ancient Dwarven mechanisms are part of portraying a fantastic world, and ginger experimentation with said potentially deadly mechanisms is part of having a life filled with adventure.<br/><br/>* You may notice that this idea has been taken from The Fifth Elephant, by Terry Pratchett.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447880/#Comment_447880" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-11T12:27:54+00:00" title="August 11, 2015 12:27PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and thanks again for all the help so far!

For the player moves, each move has a trigger. I guess my confusion has been about when a GM move triggers.<br/><br/>The rules say "whenever everyone looks to you to see what happens choose one of these [moves]". In my example above, what if Sal pulls the lever that makes the chamber slowly flood with water, and then everyone looks to me to see what happens? There's no move there, just describing the natural in-fictional consequences. Now, if things go badly, and instead of slowly filling up there's a sudden torrent then that's probably "Show signs of an approaching threat", at which point they will take actions that might lead to a Defy Danger, and if they fail that I'd probably Separate Them with the flood. But in the gentle case, there's isn't a move, is there?<br/><br/>So perhaps how it works is: When it's your turn in the conversation, see if there is a move that makes sense in the fictional circumstances. Otherwise, just describe what happens?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447883/#Comment_447883" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-11T13:53:49+00:00" title="August 11, 2015  1:53PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make custom moves:<br/>When lever A is pulled, water fills the shaft and through the airlock if it is not closed.<br/><br/>When lever B is pulled, water is drained from the shaft.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447884/#Comment_447884" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-11T13:54:46+00:00" title="August 11, 2015  1:54PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it's no danger just say "The chamber slowly floods with water.

Implicit somewhere is that you frame scenes (you do), and when you do so it's not just you talking for a couple minutes straight and everybody else shutting up: they ask you questions, they ask you to clarify details, you answer (usually by making up the answers, but then you've committed to those answers). A prolonged chat with an NPC, then? Sure, why not. It's really part of framing the scene, conceptually: you go back and forth at a leisurely pace until some sort of conflict shapes up.<br/><br/>"When they look at you expectantly", to me, is short for "whenever you need to", because the other players aren't grabbing the initiative and making moves themselves. So you never let the momentum die out, but you steer it around and occasionally drop it on their heads.<br/><br/>Complex lever puzzles: not really the kind of prep I would do for DW. Feels like over-prepping to me - I'd rather go for a blank but evocative map and a list of keywords such as monsters, treasures and miscellaneous things - but that's just me. If you <i>are</i> prepping in-depth to the point of designing an actual mechanical puzzle, then I totally agree you're effectively writing custom moves, in DW-speak, whether you realize it or not.<br/><br/>My best advice: read and possibly play Apocalypse World before venturing into DW. That's where the real food for thoughts is, and you can learn the basic play structures therein without getting overly distracted by color-driven similarities with other games. If you know how to play AW, you know how to play DW as well. The other way around, I wouldn't bet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447888/#Comment_447888" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-11T14:55:59+00:00" title="August 11, 2015  2:55PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DW (and AW before it) benefits and is built an a concentric design, so always start at the top:<br/><br/>1) It's a conversation.<br/>2) Agenda<br/>3) Principles<br/>4) Moves<br/><br/>Start at the top! And don't let something higher be constrained by what's lower. In other words, if the natural thing to happen in the conversation is "The pit slowly fills with water, gently rising up the boats floating below.", that's okay.<br/><br/>Also: "When you sit down at the table as a GM you do these things:<br/><br/>* Describe the situation<br/>* Follow the rules<br/>* Make moves<br/>* Exploit your prep"<br/><br/>When you say the above, you're describing the situation and exploiting your prep.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a move! "Offer an opportunity, with or without cost"; you're offering the opportunity to control the flow of movement in the area, with a cost of taking the time and effort to understand the levering system. Also could be seen as "Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask" and "Show signs of an approaching threat".<br/><br/>But my top point is, when the players miss a move, look to you to see what happens, or hand you a golden opportunity, make a move; it can be as hard as you'd like, but doesn't need to be. However, it might just be that you forgo that opportunity, and simply describe the natural flow of events, even if it's not necessarily a "move".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447889/#Comment_447889" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-11T15:10:08+00:00" title="August 11, 2015  3:10PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks <a href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">@Antisinecurist</a> that makes a lot of sense to me.

I usually derive that from the internal logic of the place, stuff like "there's a trigger on the steps to prevent people from coming down, because the people who built it want the place to stay sealed".<br/><br/>Then I use all those triggers as hard moves. It basically turns into Fiction Physics. If the players are careful, they can avoid triggering stuff, and if they trigger stuff, more stuff happens, which prompts more action from them. The interesting bit is how the situation moves from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447893/#Comment_447893" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-11T16:34:46+00:00" title="August 11, 2015  4:34PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would consider the flowchart to be entirely upside down! They're starting at the lowest level and working up, which is... confusing.<br/><br/>I would say, instead "You want to say something?" -&gt; "Does it fit 'How to GM'" (Y)-&gt; "Does it fit your Agenda" (Y)-&gt; "Does it fit your principles?" (Y)-&gt; "Is it a move?" (Y)-&gt; "Make your move"<br/><br/>If the answer to make a move (or probably even "does it fit your principles") is "no", the next question is "Does it follow from the fiction? Is it the best option to follow from the fiction?" and if "yes", "say it anyway". If it keeps the conversation going and helps fill your agenda (and maybe principles), it's still good to say, I think.<br/><br/>As far as 'There's also no GM move called "have a freeform social interaction."' in the SE thread, hm. I would say that type of social interaction is "describing the situation" (IE what the person is saying in return), and portraying the world.<br/><br/>But actually the example's pretty bad: "Merely asking someone politely isn\u2019t parleying. That\u2019s just talking. You say, \u201cCan I have that magic sword?\u201d and Sir Telric says, \u201cHell no, this is my blade, my father forged it and my mother enchanted it\u201d and that\u2019s that."<br/><br/>Ahaha, this is actually a move!!! "Reveal an unwelcome truth"; the unwelcome truth is that Sir Telric sure isn't going to give up his magic sword just for asking.<br/><br/>I would say... there is opportunity for any number of moves there! The problem here is "That's that.". But the MC could also look at what's next!<br/><br/>"Give an opportunity that fits a class\u2019 abilities" - Let's say the person asking is the bard, but we have a cleric or paladin in the party. "Sir Telric says 'Hell no! This is my blade, forged by my father and blessed by my mother.'. He turns and walks away, offended by your brash request, but you know Telric to be a devout man; perhaps a more honest man, favored of the gods, would have had better results."<br/><br/>"Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment" - "Sir Telric looks at you and spits; 'You're a dwarf, and dressed as a peasant to boot! Why would I ever gift you with my father's blade!?'. He curses in disdain and stalks away from you, heading towards the garrison."<br/><br/>"Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask" - "Sir Telric looks at you and cocks his head. 'Hm. Such a sudden request! I would only gift my blade to someone who could best me in single combat."<br/><br/>So you see... it actually was a move here, but in fact there may have been more "interesting" choices.<br/><br/>Anyway, to go back to the point: "The GM cheats in Dungeon World when they speak without following their Agenda, Principles, and Moves."<br/><br/>This is not true! Maybe you can say they cheat when they speak without following their agenda and principles, but actually I'd say their not cheating but doing their job not so well. But moves are tools to accomplish the agenda and principles (and a framework for player consequences), so I'd say that they should not be seen as a limiting and guiding light.<br/><br/>Actually most of his suggestions are really good, but I think he misrepresents a bit. If you only and ever say things that are moves, you will painfully constrain yourself sometimes. Yes, you should endeavor to see things in the move framework, and most of the things you say will - if you consider them right - fit into a move, but if you sit and obsess each time you will drive yourself mad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447895/#Comment_447895" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-11T17:48:18+00:00" title="August 11, 2015  5:48PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2015 5:51PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting conversation. <br/><br/>And, in fact, I think that's the key to this question: roleplaying is a conversation.<br/><br/>As with anything else that's as involved as human communication, you can have principles, but you won't be able to apply them like a robot: you still have to use your judgement and go with the flow.<br/><br/>Imagine writing a set of Principles and Moves for "going on a date". (I'll leave your Agenda up to you...)<br/><br/>You could have something like:\n<blockquote><br/>"When it's your turn to talk, and your date looks at you expectantly, choose a move:<br/><br/>* Ask them how they feel about the topic you were just discussing.<br/>* Bring up a new topic of conversation and ask him/her a question.<br/>* Ask them if they'd like to leave and continue the date somewhere else.<br/>etc...<br/>[...]<br/></blockquote>\nWhen you follow these "moves", you'll know quite naturally when to use them, right? There's not strict rule for how many words you can say before you use a "move", but if you're just talking and talking and not using one of them, at some point you'll have gone too far: your date is bored.<br/><br/>Having said that, I don't think Dungeon World is very well-suited to an old-school "dungeon crawl" style of gaming: it has different goals and needs. It's more of an adventure genre: exciting action and drama is what you're going for. The moves are structured to always move things forward and to leave you with space to improvise action: you, as the MC/GM/DM, are not supposed to just passively "referee" the game the way you would in an old-school dungeon crawl. You're supposed to push where they're weak and fill their lives with adventure, think dangerous, and all that other stuff. Better to imagine yourself as a movie director than an old-school "dungeon master". You're adventurers in a fantastic world... there's always *something* which could go wrong.<br/><br/>Back to the example:<br/><br/>As Sandra says, explaining that the shaft fills up with water is a custom move, in a way: you're exploiting your prep and telling them the consequences of their action (pulling the lever).<br/><br/>Now, what happens next? This is where your human instincts for managing a conversation come in.<br/><br/>Is the player sitting on the front of their chair, ready to say something else, which the lever-pulling was just a set up for? Then cede the conversation to them. They're still in the driver's seat, so to speak - you were just responding to their query.<br/><br/>"I pull the lever!"<br/>"Ok, the shaft fills up with water..."<br/>"Great! I was hoping for that. I throw the Fire Stone into the water!"<br/><br/>Are the players sitting expectantly, waiting for you to say something? Then you'd better use a move, as the rules suggest. Now the ball's in your court.<br/><br/>"I pull the lever!"<br/>"Ok, the shaft fills up with water..."<br/>"Oh, wow! And?"<br/>"Well, there's a boat floating on the surface.

There's no move there, just describing the natural in-fictional consequences. Now, if things go badly, and instead of slowly filling up there's a sudden torrent then that's probably "Show signs of an approaching threat", at which point they will take actions that might lead to a Defy Danger, and if they fail that I'd probably Separate Them with the flood. But in the gentle case, there's isn't a move, is there?</blockquote>\nIf the room starts to fill with water and they just look to you to see what happens, you say "well, you drowned I guess?" Why are players just sitting there as the room fills with water? If you want to be nice I guess you might say "so the water's getting pretty high, like shoulder height, what are you doing?" You could say that that's announcing an approaching threat, but that's probably not what you think of in the moment.<br/><br/>Which is kind of the point. Most of the time, as a GM, you'll probably be making GM moves without thinking about it.

(And "just play, but look at the list of moves whenever things seem to be stuck or not going well" is excellent advice.)<br/><br/>That said, analyzing a little further:<br/><br/>I think the basic idea of the AW "conversation" is that when the MC makes a move, a good move is something which:<br/><br/>* Demands a response of some type from the players<br/>and/or<br/>* Sets you up to make a harder move<br/><br/>Aggressive moves do both (for instance, offering a hard choice, like allowing the rabid dogs to catch up to you or jumping into the crocodile-infested river).<br/><br/>When you do one or the other, you throw the ball back in the players' court, which keeps the conversation flowing. They have to react now, and they know exactly what's expected of them, conversationally-speaking.<br/><br/>That's the problem with "it fills up with water": it doesn't really do either. So, if the players don't respond to it, they don't take action, the ball is still "in your court". You're going to need to make another move (or, another way to look at it: the water is just description, but you haven't really made a move yet).<br/><br/>I think sometimes the players have their own move ready, though, and then it's ok to just let them go - that's why I like to think of it as the players making a move which includes pulling that lever, but they're not *done* yet. This is just you giving feedback to their description so far, but they have more to say.<br/><br/>As for the whole "high octane" issue:<br/><br/>The conversation is no different in quiet, downtime moments; you're just going to focus on "lower octane" subject material.<br/><br/>Moves can be things like:<br/><br/>"They lean in expectantly. It looks like they want to hear more of your story!"<br/><br/>"The sun is setting, lighting the sky in a myriad hues. What's the most painful memory you have associated with a sunset?"<br/><br/>"The barkeep is prepared to tell you more about the swamps, but you should probably buy another drink if you want to stay and listen. Will you?"<br/><br/>"She moves closer to you by the fire, putting her hand right next to yours. What do you do?"<br/><br/><i><br/>(As an aside, I've never understood why "ask provocative questions" was a principle, and not a move.)</i><br/><br/>What the move structure helps with, though, is to realize that, for instance, an old man telling a story about the origins of the world is not a move. <br/><br/>I've seen a lot of GMs do that kind of thing and then go quiet, expecting a response from the players... but it's not clear what response is appropriate (from a "game design" point of view: you were listening, and now you've stopped listening - what's the right thing to do now?).<br/><br/>The sage's story is just colour narration, basically. The players will still likely be waiting for you to say something afterwards. ("Ok, so do orcs burst through the door now? Or we just sitting there?")<br/><br/>That's when you look down at the Moves and pick one, in other words. In that awkward silence which suggests the conversation has lost its flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447912/#Comment_447912" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-11T21:48:25+00:00" title="August 11, 2015  9:48PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The questions don't have to be that provocative.

Just breeze through it in your description.  If your players really want to stop in the meadow and look for wild strawberries, they can say "Whoa, hold on, I want to look for berries."</blockquote>\nI think this is an important point beyond the obvious because a lot of players are used to a type of play that takes cues that they're supposed to interact with soft offers - and often it's a specific kind of interaction. And I've found that's especially common for people who are into Manipulate the World type of sandboxes. That can be an amazingly fun type of play, but it can also set up expectations that are problematic with games that are more about stakes.<br/><br/>So, to the OP, just having things in the world for players to manipulate and expecting them to deal with it can be a productive way to play, especially if you know your players. But, in my experience, that's just not the wheelhouse of DW. Because as soon as players start interacting with basically anything beyond looking around, stakes get brought in on a level that can cause them to Kool-Aid Man through the puzzle or get diverted away from it, entirely. That's where custom moves come in, but even with those, it's often best to expect that sort of classic interactivity to get condensed or even circumvented. So I'd say think less about "how does this work, exactly?" and more about "what kind of challenge does this provide for these, specific characters?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447922/#Comment_447922" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-12T05:06:58+00:00" title="August 12, 2015  5:06AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For some reason I think that \u201dmeadow, a breeze blows, wdyd\u201d example is awesome and I'm gonna try it.

There's no free and clear stage where we say, "OK, if you make your defy danger roll, you make an acrobatic roll past the golem, but if you fail, he grabs you." Apocalypse World's "to do it, do it" rule applies instead.<br/><br/>"The golem reaches out a massive stone hand and tries to grab you. What do you do?"<br/>"I tuck and roll out of the way so I can flank it."<br/>"Awesome, sounds like <b>Defy Danger</b>. Roll +Dex."<br/><br/>If the player makes it, follow the move. If not, the GM gets to make a hard move.

There's no free and clear stage where we say, "OK, if you make your defy danger roll, you make an acrobatic roll past the golem, but if you fail, he grabs you." Apocalypse World's "to do it, do it" rule applies instead.<br/><br/>"The golem reaches out a massive stone hand and tries to grab you. What do you do?"<br/>"I tuck and roll out of the way so I can flank it."<br/>"Awesome, sounds like <b>Defy Danger</b>. Roll +Dex."<br/><br/>If the player makes it, follow the move. If not, the GM gets to make a hard move. The character is probably immobilized, so that would be a great time to turn to someone else and get their response.<br/><br/>Nobody gets to ask for anything more than their move entitles them to, and nobody knows in advance how their move will turn out. When my players tried to ask those sorts of questions, I'd just defer to the fiction.<br/><br/>"If I fail this roll, what happens to me?"<br/>"Well, you've never fought a Death Knight before, but from the bone-deep chill you feel whenever you look into its glowing eyes, you don't think you want it to touch you."<br/>"... OK then..."</blockquote>\nRight, it's not "setting stakes" before a roll in a mechanical sense a la Burning Wheel, it's that when you're probing the world, you will inevitably Discern Realities or Spout Lore. If you succeed, you get information that might bypass the discovery stage of interacting with the puzzle. And if you fail, even a soft move ramps up the danger and stakes. I would also say that if a GM is constantly doing soft moves and only soft moves in order to keep the game local and mellow, that GM is deliberately dodging pretty much all of what they're really supposed to be doing in DW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Dungeon World] Please help me
