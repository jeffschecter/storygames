I think I made a few major screw-ups, but overall it produced and amazingly stereotypical for D&amp;D;, but clean, gaming experience, just like I\u2019d hoped.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m using a PDF of the Red Book for the rules, here, and running the Bloodstone Idol.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Party consisted of:<br/>\n*Peppy the fighter, played by a newcomer to RPGs who\u2019d been interested in playing D&amp;D.;<br/>\n*Bob, the sadly short lived crazy old wizard guy played by an old friend who I\u2019ve gamed with before.<br/>\n*Ulrath (with an umlaut), a necromantic Dwarven priest of a dark god, played with someone who\u2019d played some D&amp;D; before and the Warhammer games, but I hadn\u2019t played with before now.<br/>\n*And Elaine, the Paladin who was old friends with Peppy, played by a friend of mine I\u2019ve had for years who has gaming experience, but I\u2019ve never played with before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I was testing this for use at a gaming club, I wanted a big mix of styles and people. Character creation took longer than it probably should, since I only printed one copy of equipment and everyone but me was totally new to the game. Interestingly, Peppy\u2019s player was one of the quickest to make a character, having no ideas about how a game should work since she was totally new.<br/>\nThe bonds broke down something like this: Ulrath was going to convert Bob, Bob was going to convince Ulrath of the ways atheistic magic-science, Ulrath owed his life to the fighter, and the paladin swore to sway Ulrath from his evil ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe stated out with the party in front of the doors to the Dungeon. They were hired by the Elaine\u2019s Paladin order to stop the no-good that the Wizard Grundloch was getting up to. The Dwarf talked to the standing stones to get some info about Grundloch, and discovered he had an assistant with him.<br/>\nAfter debating a few lighting spell options, and settling on Bob casting a Light spell, the party discovered the room full of transparent people, and promptly attracted the attention of a few goblins on patrol. Slaughtering them, they explored further and found a passage that led to the giant room of the Blood-Stone idol, with the fighting below, Peppy used one of his ropes, and slid downwards, the magic pulling his armor and weapons towards the massive statue. Peppy decided to use this and try and climb it downwards, but the swing went all wrong and he fell, getting a bit mangled in the process.<br/>\nAttrating the attention of a group of goblins and lizardmen despite the statues imposing premise, the paladin leaped on the rope to try and rescue Peppy\u2026and promptly met the same fate and fell, getting serious injured.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpringing into action, Ulrath consults his dark god for guidance, and is informed they should take the stairs. Heeding this darkest of decrees, the Wizard and Priest sprang into action, plunging into the darkness. Going downward, bob takes a cursory look at a mysterious set of vaulted doors, but ignores them and they plunges deeper into the cavern with Ulrath. They find themselves in the room of Fireflies, giant hairy creatures that belch fire, Bob pokes one with a stick, and is to slow to not be incinerated by its belch (more on that later). Ulrath doges through the room, only to attract the attention of Cassius, Grundloch\u2019s assistant. Hoping to win Cassius over to their cause, Ulrath tries to convice him that the smart move is to side with the Adventurers. Cassius finds this amusing, and menaces Ulrath, who tries to bring his mace down on Cassiuse\u2019s skull\u2026and fails dropping his weapon in the process. Cassius takes Ulrath by knifepoint to meet Grundloch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, back in the middle of the fray, Peppy and Elaine decide their best chance is to make a break for the exit, away from the statue. Running through the goblin and and lizarman hordes, the plunge down a passage only to find themselves surrounded by fearsome beasts, just as Cassius pulls in Ulrath!<br/>\nPeppy charges forwards to try and save the dark Cleric despite the beasts! A terrible gryphon slices at him he BARELY misses it and\u2026wait\u2026none of these are real. Ignoring the illusions, but providing a distraction to Cassius, Ulrtath wriggles free, just as Cassius orders a set of mesmerized goblins to tenderize the Party and then runs off. The party smashes the goblins to bits. Pausing a moment and magically healing themselves, they then see a grim figure: Grundloch Himself!<br/>\n<br/>\nGrundloch informs them that they really would be better off working with him than against him, and offers to  let them in on the whole taking over the world thing. He shows them the way to the statue, frying some goblins on the way, and beins it\u2019s activation sequence. The Statue is a giant animated construct, you see. The party debates what to do as the statue slowly comes to life after Grundloch sends a few golbins to their doom to energize the magical batteries. They decide they\u2019ll kill the bastard and begin fighting him. Peppy takes a fireball, but gets a cut, the Paladin does too, but Grundloch is ignoring everything to get the statue up-and running.<br/>\nThe party gets bashed by the flailing tentacles, but finally the Paladin sees her opening, and takes it, piercing Grundloch through the chest, but the statue\u2019s going CRAZY now, and destroying the whole place. They run out the way Ulrath entered, and start running up the stairs as the whole complex collapses. Once again in the room of Fireflies, they dodge and weave, Peppy and Elaine make it out OK, but ulrath takes a dose of flame like Bob did earlier. He sees a glipse the black void beyond the Veil, and is offered by a giant black sphere the chance to live again, IF he pledges himself to the benefit of his friends, above all else. Choosing his god over life, he declines the offer, and passes away.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter and Paladin dash out of the Dungeon, watching the statue rise from the ground and crush everything around it before collapsing after the standing stones are destroyed. Mission sort of accomplished, they head back into town, get some money from the Paladin order, sell some valuable mushrooms for lots of cash, and promptly throw a drunken party as is appropriate.<br/>\nSome thoughts on the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all,  I felt a lot like I oscillated between too hard and too soft. The Wizard dying was a weird case, because I\u2019m pretty sure I made the wrong call there. It seemed like if the wizard poked the thing with a stick, it would belch fire, and he\u2019d need to get out of the way. I think I messed up there, as the intention was to figure out stuff about the creature, and so it should have been a Discern Realities or Spout Lore.<br/>\nSpout Lore was a bit weird, because I was never quite sure when discern or Spout was the appropriate move too, but I think this was also a bit on my end.<br/>\nAlso, I think I should have pushed for more Discern Realities and Spout Lore rolls, as they seem really important to the system.<br/>\nI love the way the moves work, but I feel like they should flow from play a little more naturally than we were doing it, but that\u2019s a side effect of the Apocalypse World family of games being a little different than what people are used to, I think.<br/>\nAnd my players had a bit of trouble remembering to mark XP, and I think I could have done a better job helping with that. Player driven XP is a different experience than normally happens in D&amp;D.;<br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot to read the adeventure much before hand, so it was half by the book half winging it. It worked great anyway, and I suspect that\u2019s very much the intention of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing was though, once we were all set up? The whole game only took about two hours! It was as jam-packed with action and adventure as any D&amp;D; game I\u2019ve ever been involved in, with the same amount of things happening, just a lot faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I really enjoyed running it, and I loved that the person new to gaming was clearly surprised by the intensity of it, and how little it was like a videogame or WoW. It went over well enough I\u2019m contemplating continuing on as a short campaign game. And I\u2019m definitely running more of it in the future, albeit perhaps with a much stronger emphasis on dungeons of my own devising. I greatly anticipate the final release, and I\u2019m even considering writing a few modules for it, as it matches my style really well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343791/#Comment_343791" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T18:45:18+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  6:45PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2011 6:46PM by Felan.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad to hear someone else had a positive experience running DW with somebody totally new to tabletop RPGs (my AP is here: http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15089). the more I think about it, the more it seems like the perfect game to show n00bs what's fun, hilarious and exciting about these kinds of games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343819/#Comment_343819" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T03:35:24+00:00" title="September 24, 2011  3:35AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2011 3:35AM by johnzo.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're right about the importance of Spout and Discern.

Although much killing occurred anyway. Seriously, three minute fights are part of what I really like about this system.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also realized why it had inflating hit-points. I had been opposed to the idea of them before playing, and then in actual play I realized I was guilty of thinking it was just like D&amp;D.; In D&amp;D;, saying there's a horde of a dozen goblins attacking the players is a major pain, in DW it wouldn't take any longer than a fight with less dudes at lower levels, I don't think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game was notably intense for all involved, and was definitely what I signed up for when I tried to run Pathfinder this summer, but with WAY less work on my part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343856/#Comment_343856" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T12:29:45+00:00" title="September 24, 2011 12:29PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthew SB</cite>Sounds like Hans-and-Co. missed them as we</blockquote>\n!<br><br>Totally missed them.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343859/#Comment_343859" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T12:45:01+00:00" title="September 24, 2011 12:45PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a one-shot, I skip equipment entirely.
