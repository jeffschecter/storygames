In particular, consider breaking away from the four-sided or rectilinear model. Most games benefit from a table design that allows everyone to see each other equally easily, so look at octagonal or hexagonal designs rather than long rectangles (assuming you want to be able to play with 6 to 8 people). Or heck (i.e. "duh!") a round table.<br/><br/>In general, I'd like a gaming table with a "sub-level" of the table (or a lower-lip around the edge) for putting random crap that would otherwise clutter the table (books, pencils, etc that isn't in use). Basically a table top on the table top, with about a hand's-width of space between the two (or more). Cut circles into the upper table, and you've got drink holders that *should* prevent most spills.<br/><br/>I don't like the die-rolling pit idea, because sometimes you need to move dice around, and I like sliding them (no question that the value's been changed, as there might be if one has to pick them up). I *do* think the slightly raised edge would be nice--better still, make it padded like the edges of some bars (perhaps not as generously, though--soft for forearms to cross, not elbows and forearms to rest on). And the plexiglass top is a cool idea, too--get some dry erase markers and you don't even NEED to put maps and such under it (but you still can).<br/><br/>I'd avoid drawers and cabinets and such for the reason Jason mentions--it should be more versatile--and also because I play fairly regularly at a table with similar... and I'm going to fucking kick it to splinters if I knock my knee on the drawers again. It will also make the costs go WAY up, compared to just a "dual-top" design like I mention above, which has 90% of the same functionality, vis a vis avoiding table clutter... unless you play a game that requires four or five or more 9"x12" hard back books. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210054/#Comment_210054" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T12:23:20+00:00" title="June  2, 2009 12:23PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite gaming table I've seen is one a friend made.

The quality was amazing but the cost was beyond luxury item and into the realm of needlessly extravagent.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) did not disassemble.  It came in only 2 parts, the base and the top, and there was literally no way to get it with those dimensions to fit in my front door let alone down my narrow winding basement stairs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo things I would like to see:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) reasonably easy assembly disassembly...probably meaning more bolts and fewer screws...so that it can be carried in pieces and set up anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) more reasonable dimensions.  That thing was the size of an oversized snooker table...HUGE...clearly optimized for 12 player D&amp;D; monster games.  An octogon or hexagon shape might be more appropriate for story game play.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) the cup holders below table level was genius as was the side compartments for die rolling and the slots for books and the fold out desk tops for character sheets.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) the depressed play space in the middle was really nice, but the nicest feature of it was the clear, gridded, and hex plexiglass pieces that could be set on top of a poster map.  Making sure that area is big enough to fit current standard 4E poster maps would be a good idea.  Making that space less deep, or with a table top to make it more flush would enable it to be used for board games too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo all that and I'm almost a lock to get one.

Pill-shaped. But here's the killer wiggle:<br>* By day, the mild-manner round table makes a nice side table in an otherwise open area--tucked into a breakfast nook or in a corner of the living room between couches.<br>* By night, two leaves are inserted, each of which <i>has opposing deep drawers, and their surface is slightly recessed with plexi over it!</i> All the kit, ready to break out, but otherwise stored in a closet, inside the leaves.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>But all that said... man, just copy The Emissary. It's pretty much got it all... though I *still* think round, oct, or hex is better for RPGs; The Emissary seems to take mini games far more into account. But with some work, one could make a round Emissary. A LOT of board curving (apron and drawer faces), but possible.

But <b>with drawers, I would only build one level</b> (like the <i>Emissary</i>), otherwise you risk people hitting their shins.<br/><br/>- Here's what you do next---you make the <b>top level a ring with a removable center piece</b>. That way, a customer can buy <b>multiple center pieces for different functions</b>. The default could have a felt surface for rolling dice, but you could also sell a dry-erase piece, and maybe a clear piece (for placing maps or whatever underneath). I think this would be a win-win situation---the design would be more versatile for the user, and would probably lead to more sales revenue (no one's going to buy more than one table, but they might buy multiple center pieces).<br/><br/>- So assuming the removable center piece idea, what you can do is design the center piece so that if you <b>insert it one way, you get a recessed surface</b> for gaming. But if you <b>flip the center piece, you get a flush surface</b> for eating or whatever. You could also sell a deeper center piece with a separate cover for those people who want to be able to leave all their gaming stuff as is between sessions.<br/><br/>- For cup holders, you could make "deluxe" center pieces with <b>cup holders on the edges of the gaming surface</b> (that way, the cup holders disappear when you flip the center for eating/whatever).<br/><br/>How's that? I think I covered most of what was suggested.<br/><br/>[edit] <i>Oh, and one more idea, which I'm not sure everyone would want---assuming a dual-level design, you could make the top "outer ring" maybe 8 inches wide and made of clear plexiglass or whatever.

Need to learn to curve the apron, anyway; making the face of a drawer in the apron is just a subset of that technique. I can think of three ways off the top of my head--no, four, if you allow for a curved laminate for the drawer face, which is otherwise actually squared-off once opened (hmmm... and the dice storage tray could be built into the spacing boards that go between the front interior of the drawer and the curved laminate apron face).<br/><br/>Anyhow...
