                            Okay, so my take on it is this: there's serial fiction and then there's serial fiction.  Matt calls it episodic and serial fiction: that is, in episodic fiction, there's a new thing happening each episode but the basic structure of things doesn't change.  Classic Star Trek is a great example, as is Mission:Impossible.  Batman, Spiderman, and "classic" comic book heroes are good examples.  The characters don't change, their relationships don't change, their drives don't change.  They just apply all of those things to new stuff each episode.  In serial fiction, there's stuff every installment, but the stuff impacts the characters as much as the characters impact the stuff.  Here we're looking at Battlestar Galactica, Lost (from what I understand, at least), and Alias.  In comic book land, we're talking X-Men -- not the movie X-Men, but the comic book X-Men who have seen some pretty significant changes over time.<br/><br/>Actually, remember when Spiderman had the little "Cosmic Spiderman" bit?  Did you get annoyed?  Did you enjoy that?  That was Spiderman crossing the line from episodic to serial, and fan reaction beat that down quickly, so Spiderman returned to his comfortable old self.  See also: Mystique becoming a ninja hottie, and Wolverine when he had the bone claws.  Comics are nice because the conflicts are blatantly external.  Mystique gets a who-am-I conflict, Wolverine gets a what-is-happening-to-me conflict.<br/><br/>But to move this out of television and comics and onto the gaming table, I think all of this is perfectly possible to implement in a game.  This is, in fact, stuff that the years-long D&amp;D games have been doing for decades, now.  The two characters who were in love eventually get together and get married.  Instead of the budding romance conflicts, now they have married couple conflicts.  The rough-and-tumble outcasts fight the man until they win, and then they're in charge of the city/kingdom/whatever.  Their down-with-the-Man conflicts are replaced with I-am-the-Man-now conflicts.<br/><br/>One thing that I think is important to note is that the new conflicts usually come about as developments of the old conflicts.  This means that the new conflicts are looking at the same themes as the old conflicts, just from a different angle (marriage vs courting, still about love; administration vs rebellion, still about power).<br/><br/>The other bit that I think is important is that there's almost always more than one conflict on the table.  The two outcast lovers are struggling against the Man.  They'll eventually consummate their love and take over the city, but those things don't usually happen at the same time.  Say they marry before they beat down the Man.  So with this overly simplistic example, you've got three stages of conflicts: courting and rebellion, marriage and rebellion, marriage and administration.  Which would be a very different progression and a very different story than if they beat down the Man and then got married (courting and rebellion, courting and administration, marriage and administration).<br/><br/>Briefly, in <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>, this is accomplished by swapping out thematic batteries when you're done with them.  You've always got three, and you can only swap out one at a time between situations.  So there's always some familiar thread available to you from last time, and in play you're going to swap out stuff that's no longer interesting in favor of stuff that is -- and the stuff that has become interesting is most likely stuff that's been developed in play.<br/><br/>But I'd like to hear anybody else's thoughts on what's possible, or techniques they've used, or mechanics that support this sort of thing.  How do you switch out conflicts to keep the developing game interesting?                        </div>

                            One thing that seeing Rob's hat made me think of instantly is the old stand by of conflicts being external. <br/><br/>There is a noted tendancy in my RP, especially my Nar RP, to make conflicts have vast internal elements in which the character must change or violently reject change within themselves. That this play is so well supported by, say, With Great Power, is one of the reasons I love the game so. <br/><br/>However, if you're playing Spirit of the Century, and have a conflict that is like "stop all war" or "erradicate disease and poverty" and the issue is an external fight for a character that remains relativly internally consistant (as almost all pulp and comic book characters do) then getting a new external fight is an easy thing. <br/><br/>A revolving door of personal revleation can get cheesy PDQ, but a revolving door of external problems is pretty easy to arrange. Thus the reason you can happily play a D&amp;D character for 5 years in a weekly game, but doing the same with a Sorcerer character is going to be... rough.                        </div>

                            Well, a mental technique that I've gotten some mileage out of is this:  Do <b>not</b> say "Okay, now that I've resolved this conflict it's time to go looking around for a new one."  Say, instead, "Oh wow ... I just thought of a cool new conflict that these characters could make really sing.  Now that I <i>already have that in mind</i>, I'm going to resolve one of our existing conflicts in order to make room for the new one."                        </div>

                            Something I've always found fascinating is the way that characters change and become memorable <i>outside</i> of the mechanics of gameplay. Going up a level in D&amp;D is pretty cool, but is it what makes a character memorable? The time your party went up against a beholder, and everybody got knocked out of the fight, and the theif was the last guy standing and he killed the beholder when he had just a few hit points left himself - THAT makes a memorable character. Or how about the time you were playing DitV, and your character's "no mercy" attitude built up to an inevitable clash with the "bleeding heart" PC someone else played - and in the inevitable conflict, both characters grew and created something new and amazing.<br/><br/>These are the moments that define character to me. The game's role is to allow them to happen and (ideally) give me a way to express them on my character sheet when they do. D&amp;D doesn't do a great job of this. Dogs is great becuase I can use fallout to change my character in ways that I love. Burning Wheel lets character's beleifs grow and change as a result of things that happen in gameplay.                        </div>

                            Just to wrap my brain around this a bit:<br/><br/>Following this idea, the mechanical stakes of a conflict are "who gets to set up the next conflict."<br/><br/>That is to say... while traditional systems govern success and failure, and more avant-garde systems have governed who gets to resolve the current conflict, <i>this</i> kind of system decides who gets to set up the <i>next</i> conflict.<br/><br/>Is that accurate?                        </div>

                            Oh, Daniel, not talking about conflict as in conflict resolution.  At least not generally.  This is much larger, broader-based, story-driving conflict.<br><br>This is conflicts like "Prove myself as a soldier" or "Avoid the outbreak of hostilities."  Structurally speaking, the big stuff.  The stuff that you feed into CR will be stuff like "prove myself <em>right here, right now</em>" and "pacify the angry chieftain <em>right here, right now</em>."  Those accrue up to the "big" story-wide conflicts, yes, and part of their stakes can be setting up the next conflict in part, but I think doing it all all at once would be unfun.<br><br>I mean, this sucks:<br/>GM: "Luke, roll to see if you embrace your destiny and destroy the Death Star!"<br/>Luke: "I succeed!  The Death Star is destroyed and I go into training with a wizened old green muppet.  But then I have to choose between my personal growth and my friends!"<br/>GM: "Luke and Vader, roll off!"<br/>Vader: "I win.  Luke, I'm totally your father.  And I cut off your hand.  Me and the Emperor have another Death Star.  Suck it."<br/>GM: "Luke, can you destroy the other Death Star and defeat the Empire once and for all?"<br/>Luke: "I win!  I get Vader to throw the Emperor down a pit, and Lando blows up the new Death Star!"<br/>Everyone: "Yay!"  *sing the Ewok victory song*                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
Totally.  Sometimes the new Key is related (or directly opposed) to the old one -- for example, game events cause your PC to buy off the Key of Nonviolence and take the Key of Vengeance instead.  Other times, it's just that you get to the point where you feel like your PC has grown beyond say, the Key of Disability, and you want to focus on other conflicts and aspects of their character -- the actual circumstances don't change, maybe (your character might still be disabled in some way) but they've dealt with the conflict and now you want to shift to something else, like Key of Community or something that highlights another aspect of their character.  Either way, the combination of the buyoff and the fact that you can't really gain XP if you don't have Keys really facilitates the fostering of new conflicts that propel the story (and the character) forward.                        </div>

                            Josh,<br/><br/>Are you familiar with The Riddle of Steel's Spiritual Attributes?  You have five of them.  They are rated from 0 to 5.  They're things like Drive, Faith, Passions, etc.  They go up and down and can be replaced.  In play they act sort of like a conflict mixing board.  As they get swapped in and out, ramped up, spent down, etc the play switches focuses around those Spiritual Attributes for any given character.<br/><br/>As a very personal point I find this kind of play (and this kind of storytelling in other media) problematic because it is very difficult to get it to end.  And I value endings.  In the rare occasions that I write fiction I usually start with the ending.  Now this is not to say that nothing ever ends in the stories you describe, they do, but because there are other sorts of conflicts that are currently getting ramped up or ramped down and thus resolutions lack a certain "killing blow" feeling I like in my story resolutions.<br/><br/>As a case study my Riddle of Steel game didn't end, it stopped.  It stopped because the situation just kept get getting more complex and more baroque and although little things here and there came to an end people were constantly ramping up new things and it was nearly impossible for all the players to get things to line up and come to one momentus resolution for everything and everyone.<br/><br/>I also suspect PtA's Screen Presence values are alos meant to achieve the effect you describe.  Spotlight Episodes are more or less meant to signal the end of a character's issue or current conflict.  Because the Spotlight Episodes are stagared and placed relative to other character's Screen Presence it produces the "climax" in the middle of other stuff being ramped up or down I mentioned.<br/><br/>For reference, the only game I've ever really gotten the sense of "killing blow" resolution out of is Sorcerer.  My Life with Master comes in a close second but I've only ever played it to completion in a con environment.  Funny, considering that MLwM has a literal killing blow built into it.  I suspect this is why I recieve applause whenever I run it.  I'd still like to play a multi-session game of MLwM to completion and see if it has more of a heavy hitting resolution.<br/><br/>Just my thoughts on the subject.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

                            No, I didn't try anything like that.  That was back when I was still playing with a pretty broken group.  The game ended simply because one of the players simply decided to stop showing up despite her character being rather central to the current state of affairs.  Of course, I did my own share of ball dropping because there came a point where I almost stopped contributing the game as the Game Master in an effort to simply the players start shutting stuff down which resulted in appathetic adversity standing motionless growling at the PCs daring them to come and get them.<br/><br/>With that particular group I don't think setting a "three sessions" to wrap up would of worked.  It didn't work when we agreed to play My Life with Master over a two session period.  We knew up front we'd have two sessions.  The Endgame is explicit in that game.  And yet we got well into session two and it was clear that everyone was disregarding attempting to achieve Endgame.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean it wouldn't work with a different group of people with a different mindset.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

                            The game I'm currently designing and hopefully will release under the banner of Evil Hat Productions, tentatively called Threads, is pretty much exactly about this.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike TSOY's Keys or PTA's Issues, which primarily mechanize *suggestions* of situations, threads mechanize the situations or goals themselves. So, you'd actually have "Prove myself as a soldier: +1" on your sheet, and that represents a *thing* you want as a story, a known point of investment. In moment-to-moment conflicts, you have the choice to "weave" a thread in, which give you bonus dice.<br/>
<br/>
However, using these bonus dice gives the GM a currency that they spend to stack opposition up against you and delay the achievement or resolution of your thread. Simple pacing, basic fiction structure. Story 101.<br/>
<br/>
However, when the GM uses that currency, the value of your thread also increases. So you can get more dice as the conflict progresses. But using those greater dice gives the GM more currency for his opposition. Et cetera. So there's a continual process of escalation.<br/>
<br/>
What keeps it from sucking? A definite endpoint built in that you're working toward - reach the max, and the next conflict that the thread is woven into is the final one. This is a configurable dial - maybe it's +5, maybe it's +10. Maybe the GM gets lots of opposition currency when you use your bonus dice, maybe he only gets one point. Depends on your own sense of pacing, what type of game you're trying to do.<br/>
<br/>
Also... new threads can be started at any time. You bascially just note your desire to invest in a situation, and write the new thing down as "New thing: +1". Then you start weaving it in.<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably about a year away from releasing it. I'm hoping it'll be good, and address some of what's been discussed lately.                        </div>

                            Threads reminds me of Fred Wolkes' <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=12232.msg131294" rel="nofollow">Skein</a>.  That is such a neat angle for design. Much like an intuitive structuring of Universalis. <br/><br/>I'm also looking at having running conflicts that escalate for Sign in Stranger. I want them to "pop" after a while and have to get resolved, or have them resolve themselves into a bigger, hairier mess some other way. Maybe at a larger scale. And winning one gives you access to saying more about the world you're in. They arise from, of course I guess, fallout on lower level conflicts. <br/><br/>And some will affect just some characters, some the whole group of colonists. And if your characters have a negative relationship, that means you are committing to creating conflicts for the other player to deal with. Positive relationships mean that you are going to get entangled in the other character's problems.  <br/><br/>Now just to write the mechanics that will do all that. : )                        </div>

<b>Joshua BishopRoby</b>, yeah, I kind of thought there'd have to be a limit for it.  (A natural 20 and the conflict is ended, or you take a (semi)Permanent Character Change and end it, but you get points according to the level.)  I also like the idea that people might be able to buy into your conflicts, escalating their effect.                        </div>

                            Emily: Yeah, it basically all grew out of a desire to "idiot-proof" flags as much as possible, especially for groups where the players don't have as good a grasp of each other socially. And to free the flagging process from any kind of artifice as much as I can - basically, you can literally point at any time during play and go, "that thing, there, is cool, and I want it to last a little while". Boom, it's on your sheet, and it matters, and it shapes the future of the game's content. That's the ideal, anyway. Making it happen? Well... here's hoping. :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, re: Sign in Stranger... it'd be neat if that mechanic also governed who created opposition for whom in more of a "GM-tasks" sense. We end up with a negative relationship, so I become "mini-GM" over your adversity, with my character as the vehicle. Or something. Passing the buck around so that everyone potentially creates adversity for everyone else.<br/>

                            You know, the "conflict levels up" concept has got me really fascinated, actually. Here's why:<br/><br/>In D&amp;D for instance, characters level up, increasing in effectiveness. However, the monsters all level up too, not on their own, but tied directly to you--IE, challenge rating. They level <i>parasitically</i>, in that the challenges you face are scaled up to your ability to meet them. Essentially you gain power for the privilege of fighting more powerful enemies. I've occasionally thought that you could just call a goblin a troll, and a wolf a dragon, and save a lot of time. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>But a "conflict" leveling up <i>, if handled just right, could be a great alternative. "Conflict" could be a a great grand goal, like "liberate the kingdom," or if you wanted more bog-standard D&amp;Dish play, it could be something like "emnity with Orcs," so that all Orc encounters would be scaled up as it levels. This has two advantages over Challenge rating: 1) if it truly levels independently (not "OK, it gets the same EXP you get"), then it would be possible to outstrip that particular conflict as you struggle against it, by doing what's necessary to gain EXP faster, and 2) it would be possible to have several different conflicts running at once and leveling independently, so that the one you really focus on will shoot up to Epic Struggle status, while others that aren't important will be left behind. This severs to create (to borrow a term being knocked around in another thread) a nice <i>contrast</i> between the different arenas of conflict, saying essentially, that Luke rocks over Stormtroopers but really struggles with Vader. Or insert Spidey and bank robbers and Doc Ock. Or whatever.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is getting off topic from the OP, or perhaps it's one method of "breeding" conflicts to use for "revolving door" play. Heck, if one conflict becomes your Big Thing, chances are once it's resolved you've got one or several candidates groomed to step in as the new Thing. Whaddya think?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel</i> </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite><br/>Have you played tSoY? Do you find tSoY's Keys any better than tRoS' SAs? Or do they suffer the same issue? Just curious.</blockquote>
I have not played tSoY but I've read it.  I do prefer the Keys over the SAs because of the 'buyoff' issue which encodes a much powerful 'ending' mechanic for any individual set of conflicts.  It doesn't solve the swap in/swap out on going surrounding conflicts issue though.  However, the Transendence rules speak to this issue in that it's a signal that this character is now over.  However, that doesn't solve the problem of everyone coming to a satisfactory ending roughly at the same time in order to bring a complete ending to the game as a whole.<br/><br/>But then again there's nothing about Kickers that guarantee that happens either but for some reason it does almost 100% of the time.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

<p>Also, re: Sign in Stranger... it'd be neat if that mechanic also governed who created opposition for whom in more of a "GM-tasks" sense. We end up with a negative relationship, so I become "mini-GM" over your adversity, with my character as the vehicle. Or something. Passing the buck around so that everyone potentially creates adversity for everyone else.</p>

<p>I can't say precisely what Emily will do with the advice, but that was one of the suggestions made after the last playtest.</p>
