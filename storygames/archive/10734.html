This idea sort of formed whole sale in my mind and demanded that I write it down.  So I did and the result is<br/><br/><a href="http://bloodthornpress.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/thornesalpha1-0oct2009.pdf" rel="nofollow">Thornes</a><br/><br/>That's a playable alpha draft of the text but I have not yet play tested it myself.  If it captures anyone's imagination enough to try it, I welcome feedback.  Almost everyone I've described the game to has had a very visceral reaction.<br/><br/>Design Goals<br/><br/>When it comes to resolution mechanics that promote detailed back-and-forth conflicts my two favorites are Dogs in the Vineyard and Sorcerer.  Given the concept I really saw no reason to re-invent the wheel.  I think Sorcerer is a little better suited to the visceral forward moving action I wanted out of Thornes so the core resolution system is lifted nearly wholesale from that game.<br/><br/>Given that I was using a pre-existing die mechanic it was my goal to build up around it a bunch of fairly unique systemic components which would serve the design purposes of creating a very visual and emotionally violent game.  Here are some of the highlights.<br/><br/>* Character Creation begins with creating a distinct Image for the character before building up any other details.<br/><br/>* The game is narrated entirely in Black and White but each player gets one Color they may use to paint narrative elements that are important to them.  However, the color Red has special meaning in the game and has unique rules that impact the GM's ability to influence outcomes.<br/><br/>* Characters build up Motifs over the course of the game which the presence of marks a scene as particularly important to a given character.<br/><br/>* All conflicts result in someone being Injured in some way.  If you're picking up the dice your character is trying to harm someone.<br/><br/>* The central stat of the game is called Ego.  You gain Ego by having sex, killing someone or crushing someone else's Ego.  However, if your Ego gets too high you enter a state called Ego Tripping where you become more vulnerable.<br/><br/>The title of this thread uses the somewhat more polite form of the tag line.  However, the text still retains the original tag line that was conceived with the help of Alex Duarte (author of unWritten).<br/><br/>Thornes: A vulgar game about fucking your enemies and murdering your lovers.<br/><br/>I hope some of you find a use for this game.  Assuming I can play-test it I will update the text periodically with the results.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fealoro" title="fealoro"><img alt="fealoro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fealoro">fealoro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238108/#Comment_238108" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T04:30:38+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  4:30AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2009 4:54AM by fealoro.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jesse<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of your game, and the setting too (actually some part of The Three musketeers could have be written by Miller).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust two or three things I could add (I'm not a game designer, I'm a humble player)<br/>\n<br/>\n-The NPC on 5 questions of each PC should be Significant Character, and ther should be a limit on the number of new SC introduced.

Maybe come NPC could be promoted after a number of encounter or relationship.</blockquote>\nThe NPCs from the questions are Significant Characters.  Under the section on Significant Characters I think I say something like, "all NPCs on the character's sheets" by which I meant the answers to the questions.  I'm not sure the game needs a hard limit though.  From my experience players are pretty good at circling a fixed cast once it hits a critical size.  To some extent though, that's why the GM is the final arbiter on who is and isn't a Significant Character.\n<blockquote>-I wonder if there is a way to link conflict, injuring, chaining so that each scene would be just a big conflict. I think that could speed the pace and add stress to the urgency to act, instead of just walking around</blockquote>\nI've personally grown very tired of the one scene = one conflict setup of a lot of games.  I like my games to breathe a little these days where "walking around" is possible so long as it is layering a foundation needed for something coming up in the very near future.  The game is tight and fast but there's such a thing as too tight and fast.\n<blockquote>-I think the GM could need more help, like a good description of the setting, with a list of clich\xe8 and plot point that could be inserted in the story.</blockquote>\nYes, absolutely.  This is by no means a finish text.  In fact, there's a lot more there than I was planning on writing for alpha 1.0.  I wanted to write enough such that anyone who was grabbed by the concept could probably play it fairly well.  Things I want to add in the future include example characters as well as suggested locations to flesh out the setting a little bit.  However, if possible I'd like to pull these from actual play, so I'm waiting for play testing to write those sections.  They will be in Alpha 2.0.\n<blockquote>-I don't understand why have the wounder modifier about the type of Injury. I think that everything should be left to the description, an Injury from a brawl could be as deadly as from a gun.</blockquote>\nThat's a modified version of the mechanic lifted from Sorcerer.  In Sorcerer I used to not be particularly fond of the modifiers either.  But that's because I had players who largely stuck to the same weapon type across the group.  Then one day I had a guy play a brawler and all of sudden his fight scenes were a tad longer but also much more brutal.  I realized that like most things in Sorcerer something which seemed like a nod to old-fashioned "realism" thinking had an underlying narrative logic.  It's not that a blade does more damage than a fist, it's that it takes more moral conviction to beat a man to death with your bare hands.  I liked that effect in Sorcerer and wanted to preserve it for Thornes.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your feedback!<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238172/#Comment_238172" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T11:26:25+00:00" title="October 19, 2009 11:26AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya Jesse, <br/><br/>Quick question, did you make this game Black and White so Morgan and James would shut up about Noir beinging a film lighting style and not a type of story? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Ok, more seriously, looking forward to reading this over and I really like the idea of narrating a game in Black and White with the important stuff being colored in.

Thoughts on first read.<br/><br/>On the 10 points to distribute:  As written you can't start with an Ego higher than 3.  Since Ego is used in every roll and is essentially your story hitpoints, I cannot see any reason to set Ego less than 3.  If you set Ego at 3, then you must set Dominance and Violence at least at 3...which means essentially...every character starts with 3s in everything with 1 point to add to D or V.  I see where the Ego Tripping rules address this, but honestly, those rules don't seem very fun.<br/><br/>I'm thinking either Ego should be Hitpoints only and not something you ever roll...so there is value to D and V that E doesn't have.  Or that E costs twice as much as either V or I so that you get more bang for your buck by buying dice in D or V...but that doesn't help every roll and doesn't provide story hitpoints.  With this you'd probably need 20 points to distribute with E being 2 each.<br/><br/>How are non "Conflicts" adjudicated.  Entirely at GM fiat?  If the overall goal of the conflict is to inflict harm, does each individual die roll need to be?  What if I want to do  to set myself up (via chaining) for a major smack down on you...but  is not in itself a harm produding action.  Legit?  If so...am I restricted to only taking the Chaining option?<br/><br/>Why limit Chaining to just that scene.  I always thought Sorcerer's "next roll only" rule to be the weakest part of its dice mechanics.  Without that restriction you can use Chaining to model all sorts of really cool stuff...like starting a rumor mill today that will give you beau coup bonuses later on when you find yourself trying to debate that person in front of the king and can use those rumors to humiliate him.<br/><br/>Drop the "most dice" tie breaker.  With it the Interruption won't happen that often and Interruption sounds far more exciting and interesting than just winning by 1 anyway.<br/><br/>What value are you rolling your Dominance against to stay in the fight once you've suffered wounds &gt; violence?  The opponent's roll for the roll you're trying to make?  How about making the roll against a number of dice equal to the largest single wound you've suffered instead.  That way you aren't doubleing up on the opposing difficulty and can have a neat mechanical differentiator between lots of small wounds vs 1 big one, without any additional rules complexity.<br/><br/>Similarly, I'd give the opponent bonus dice equal to your single greatest wound rather than current wound total.  Have total wounds simply accumulate towards the Violence thresholds.<br/><br/>I like the injuring relationships rule but it seems weak that the injury is "healed" after the first time it is used to someone elses advantage.  Also not a fan of the Relationship Recovery rules.  I'm not sure what I'd replace it with, but this seems like an area of HUGE potential that currently is nearly untapped.  Making these rules more robust could create a game where manipulating each other's relationships like pawns becomes not only fictionally plausible, but mechanically reinforced as well.  I'd like to see a whole relationship map of progressively damaged relationships, perhaps with the ability to Chain bonuses into relationships as a form of earning favor with someone.  I'd like to see some kind of "relationship wars" where I can steal your relationships and make them mine, and "capturing" relationships becomes an important game activity.  Perhaps each player has a limited number of relationship slots and once relationships have been invented to absorb damage such that all slots are filled, no more relationships can be invented but must be taken from others.  Thus characters with expanded webs are more "invulnerable" and characters whose relationships have been stripped away are at risk.  Maybe a Player can always shunt Ego damage into a relationship representing mistreating that individual in some way that restores the character's Ego.  Lots of potential there but I don't think the current rules really scratch the surface much.<br/><br/>Not a fan of losing Ego to make an appeal.  This seems to run afoul of the game answering its own premise mechanically.  If being honest and sincere loses you Ego, and Ego is your story relevance...then the game is automatically programmed to force you to not be honest and sincere.  That seems much less interesting than letting someone try to be sincere if they are willing to risk the E vs. E+D disadvantage of doing so.  Similarly the restriction on there being no possible way to inflict injury seems unnecessary.  I'd rather see this as an open player choice...sure be honest if you like...let's see how long you can get away with it before the lack of effectiveness frustrates you enough to turn to dominance or violence.<br/><br/>Recovering from wounds:  If using the individual wounds method, I'd half each wound rounding down after a scene.  That way a character with a bunch of 1 point wounds heals almost instantly, but larger wounds linger for several scenes.  Also, this works very well with the Aggressor only getting a bonus equal to the largest wound.  Using that bonus halfs just that largest wound, potentially meaning it won't be the largest anymore.  That sounds nicely flavorful rather than then the current rules which seem rather sterile.<br/><br/>Ego Tripping.  I think making Ego Tripping simply a mechanical penalty sounds rather boring and unfun (in the same way that whiffing is unfun).  Try this on instead, roll the dice E + D or V as normal.  Any Victories you earn in excess of 1 on the roll give the GM Consequences.  Bad Things that happen to your character (immediately or at some point in the future) as a result of your hubris.  For instance, you defeat your opponent in a duel while Ego Tripping...you won the fight but now court <br/>oppinion of you has fallen...you are seen as boorish and capricious and your defeated opponent has won great sympathy.  In other words, use the Consequences to turn their victory into ashes rather than just make victory less likely.<br/><br/>Audience Pool is mentioned under locations, but I couldn't find the text that says what you do with them...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238217/#Comment_238217" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T16:01:20+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  4:01PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Loving it.  Thoughts on first read.</blockquote>\nThank you.  And great feedback!\n<blockquote>On the 10 points to distribute:  As written you can't start with an Ego higher than 3.  Since Ego is used in every roll and is essentially your story hitpoints, I cannot see any reason to set Ego less than 3.  If you set Ego at 3, then you must set Dominance and Violence at least at 3...which means essentially...every character starts with 3s in everything with 1 point to add to D or V.  I see where the Ego Tripping rules address this, but honestly, those rules don't seem very fun.<br/><br/>I'm thinking either Ego should be Hitpoints only and not something you ever roll...so there is value to D and V that E doesn't have.  Or that E costs twice as much as either V or I so that you get more bang for your buck by buying dice in D or V...but that doesn't help every roll and doesn't provide story hitpoints.  With this you'd probably need 20 points to distribute with E being 2 each.</blockquote>\nYeah, I'm aware of the math.  I'm not 100% happy with it either.  I know you're not very fond on relying on the fiction as a mechanical limiter but I'm hoping the fictional consequences of chaining/Relationship Injury/Wounding are simply grabby enough such that raw Ego damage is relatively rare, reserved only for those moments where fictionally it's clear the character is broken by his experiences.  In play test that may simply not turn out to be the case in which case, yes, Ego needs serious revision.<br/><br/>Assuming I'm right about the rarity of raw Ego damage the reason you might set your Ego relatively low is because from a character concept perspective you want to really over preform in one area over the other.  But that might not work out in practice.\n<blockquote>How are non "Conflicts" adjudicated.  Entirely at GM fiat?  If the overall goal of the conflict is to inflict harm, does each individual die roll need to be?  What if I want to doto set myself up (via chaining) for a major smack down on you...butis not in itself a harm produding action.  Legit?  If so...am I restricted to only taking the Chaining option?</blockquote>\nNo Chance of Injury = No Conflict = No Dice.  The Appeal rules are the exception and as you've pointed out later they're a concession that might simply have to go.  That said here's the example I've been using to make the point clear to people.  A seduction is not a date.  On a date people are openly communicating, learning about one another, genuinely growing close which may lead to sex.  A seduction is an attempt to by pass all of that.  It's an attempt to confound and confuse and manipulate.  In the morning the person might have regrets about what happened.  They might be thinking, "Man, what would my mother think of me now?"  That's Injury.\n<blockquote>Why limit Chaining to just that scene.  I always thought Sorcerer's "next roll only" rule to be the weakest part of its dice mechanics.  Without that restriction you can use Chaining to model all sorts of really cool stuff...like starting a rumor mill today that will give you beau coup bonuses later on when you find yourself trying to debate that person in front of the king and can use those rumors to humiliate him.</blockquote>\nActually, this is the exact behavior both Sorcerer and Thornes are actively trying to discourage.  Whatever you setup in scene A you better take advantage of it in Scene B.  Doing lots of little "setups" that will pay off big later is simply not the kind of game Sorcerer or Thornes is.  Both games are deliberately working against you doing that.  And, in fact, I'm deliberately taking it one step further than Sorcerer by limiting Chaining to within a scene.  If you want dice to travel outside the scene then you've got to Injure and even then you're risking someone else capitalizing on it before you do.<br/><br/>Note: I had been considering keeping a "lock" on a Relationship Injury such that no one else could capitalize on it until you'd had at least one follow up scene.\n<blockquote>Drop the "most dice" tie breaker.  With it the Interruption won't happen that often and Interruption sounds far more exciting and interesting than just winning by 1 anyway.</blockquote>\nI'll consider that.  The "Interruption" thing is a tack on stolen from My Life with Master just because I've never liked the all-be-it extremely rare case of re-rolling in Sorcerer.\n<blockquote>What value are you rolling your Dominance against to stay in the fight once you've suffered wounds &gt; violence?  The opponent's roll for the roll you're trying to make?  How about making the roll against a number of dice equal to the largest single wound you've suffered instead.  That way you aren't doubleing up on the opposing difficulty and can have a neat mechanical differentiator between lots of small wounds vs 1 big one, without any additional rules complexity.</blockquote>\nI believe the rules state that you roll your Dominance against your current Wound value.  It should be Ego + Dominance vs. Wound value.  I may have mis-typed that.\n<blockquote>Similarly, I'd give the opponent bonus dice equal to your single greatest wound rather than current wound total.  Have total wounds simply accumulate towards the Violence thresholds.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's worth thinking about.  I think I'll play test it a few times with the single Wound value and then maybe experiment with individual Wounds and see what that feels like.\n<blockquote>I like the injuring relationships rule but it seems weak that the injury is "healed" after the first time it is used to someone elses advantage.  Also not a fan of the Relationship Recovery rules.  I'm not sure what I'd replace it with, but this seems like an area of HUGE potential that currently is nearly untapped.

You should really be thinking no further ahead than one scene, ever.  If you're planning and manipulating and being "subtle" then I've designed the game wrong.  The game is meant to be very now or never.  Planners and manipulators will get fucked by more aggressive players.  Which is exactly what I want to have happen.  However, there's a lot of interesting ideas you've packed in here, so I"m not dismissing it out of hand.  I have to break it down and give it some thought.  Some of this may be adaptable to what I want the game to do.\n<blockquote>Not a fan of losing Ego to make an appeal.  This seems to run afoul of the game answering its own premise mechanically.

Perhaps one not worth making.  I'll think about it.\n<blockquote>Recovering from wounds:  If using the individual wounds method, I'd half each wound rounding down after a scene.

That sounds nicely flavorful rather than then the current rules which seem rather sterile.</blockquote>\nHmmm... interesting.  My goal with Wounds was to try and preserve the mechanical effect of Temporary + Lasting penalties in Sorcerer without (a) having them be penalties (i.e. bonuses only) and (b) not have to track two separate sometimes confusing things.  Like I said earlier I may try it both ways and see which way feels better.\n<blockquote>Ego Tripping.  I think making Ego Tripping simply a mechanical penalty sounds rather boring and unfun (in the same way that whiffing is unfun).  Try this on instead, roll the dice E + D or V as normal.

In other words, use the Consequences to turn their victory into ashes rather than just make victory less likely.</blockquote>\nThat's interesting but that's moving more in that global story manipulation stuff that I'm trying to avoid.  Anything that happens, happens right here, right now or not at all.  It's all well and good to use that kind of stuff as fictional justification for later behaviors or creative contributions but all *mechanical* effects should reach no further than the next scene.  This is action-by-action play and stopping to consider how I'm going to apply my two points of Consequences isn't something I want.<br/><br/>But!  I like the idea of excessive victories on an Ego-Tripping score being used against you rather than flat penalty.  I'll think about that.\n<blockquote>Audience Pool is mentioned under locations, but I couldn't find the text that says what you do with them...</blockquote>\nIt's explained under Motifs where Audience Pool is first introduced just before Locations.<br/><br/>Thanks again.
