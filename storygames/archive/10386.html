The people I play with are usually new to role-playing games and are definitely new to the current generation of new designs. I love all the innovations that I'm seeing, but the last thing I want to do is subject a new gamer to rules changes, errata, and broken systems. I'll happily playtest a game if someone else is running it, but if I'm the GM or facilitator, I want to have fun and I want those I play with to have fun as well.<br/><br/>That being said, I'll happily wait for Mythender, Action Castle, Danger Patrol, Empire of Dust, Land of Yeld, FreeMarket, PTA 3rd, Storming the Wizard's Tower, Misspent Youth, etc, etc... but I'm going to wait until they're out of the oven.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230875/#Comment_230875" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T13:01:12+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  1:01PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Not a crime.

But it'd been in all of the Pirate Jenny press, and I was getting emails and IMs and Facebook messages asking me how much it'd cost, and.. I just succumbed to peer pressure. I didn't want to disappoint people. <br/><br/>I knew it wasn't done and I wasn't even sure if the results of its one playtest a year ago were even replicable, so I spent the money and I made it free and I sent it as a "Playtest document," with a strongly-worded preface that explained its state and that it was NOT an ashcan, because "ashcan" these days seems to mean ninety-zillion different things, none of which were true about my game. And it was still a total fucking disaster.<br/><br/>I'm super against ashcans, and I shouldn't have succumbed to the temptation to try and get people to play a game that wasn't finished. My only consolation is that it was free, and I didn't charge anyone for the privilege of attempting to play my half-chewed thoughts.

I guess what I'm saying is I'd do some playtesting, except the community has failed to produce any magical girl or super robot RPG ashcans/betas/whatever.<br/><br/>I'm glad there are people out there willing to playtest unfinished games--I've benefited from people doing just that with my creations every now and then--but I wouldn't in a million years dream of calling it an obligation or anything like that.

For Graham's new adventure we got fifteen volunteer groups; for Skulduggery, ten.

There is a difference between an ashcan and a first edition of a game that later goes on to be revised.  A huge difference.  Dust Devils played fine in the first edition and so did PTA.  They were finished games.<br/><br/>Elizabeth, the Ashcan Front had extremely specific goals and requirements for games to be marketed there as Ashcans.  I suspect that not all of the books published (especially post-Front or otherwise independent of that project) met those criteria.  This is a problem with the indie scene.  The creators are the sole arbiter of what can and should be published, and if they choose to put out an incomplete or untested game nobody can stop them.  It doesn't matter if they put the stamp of "ashcan" on it or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231172/#Comment_231172" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T11:26:30+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 11:26AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Jamey, Elisabeth, etc....<br/><br/>I think that Joshua is not talking about "first edition" at all.

I love playtesting.<br/><br/>Seriously, I love thinking about the game while I'm playing it. Love watching the moving parts do their dance. Even love noticing where they rub together or run into each other. Playtesting means that I get to do all that and I don't have to pay for the privilege (4e skill challenges, much hate). It means I get variety in my diet, at the cost of the occasional weird mushroom that gives me the head-spins. Even that's OK, because I like the occasional head-spin. And it means I get to see games evolve; when their designer is better than me, which is to say every time, it means I get to watch a skilled artisan in his workshop while he builds his astonishing machine.<br/><br/>Obviously, the magical theater isn't for everyone. Shreyas likes the magic bookstore.
