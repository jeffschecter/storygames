While many folks think to monetize the concept for virtual tour guides (i.e. hyper-media overlaying reality), I think we could come up with some bad-ass gaming applications.<br/><br/>There's already folks working it for minis, which makes sense as that market typically has cash to burn. I can't find the damned video, but it shows overlays for things like weapon range, movement points, and so-forth, removing the need for measuring tapes and counters and look-up sheets. It uses some kind of bar code base onto which you can put your mini, to select actions or weapons or whatever you encode (presumably).<br/><br/>There's the obvious porting of "online gaming tables" to a virtual overlay on your kitchen table at home: all of the  math subsumed into the interface, without everyone staring at a TV all the time or having to wait for an individual to input each action.<br/><br/>What else would be The Hotness? Call this a dream tread, a poll, a link accumulator: whatever. What would YOU do with virtual vision overlays, in YOUR gaming? How would it change the way RPGs (or other in-person games) are created? Could this be a major convergence of softcopy and hardcopy; or would you not even need a manual anymore, instead not only playing the game with vision overlays, but learning it that way as well (perhaps with a virtual game designer sitting at the table with you)?<br/><br/>Go wild!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212643/#Comment_212643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T11:21:44+00:00" title="June 16, 2009 11:21AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought of doing this sort of thing quite often in the past. Last thing I knocked up - well, half-knocked-up before I got ill - was an automatic sector generator for Traveller. I really must finish that thing someday. See, I worked out that to generate a complete sector for Traveller you'd need to make... well, let's see, here's the calculations:<br/><br/>1 sector = 4 subsectors<br/>1 subsector is a 10 x 8 hex grid, so 80 hexes in total.<br/>That's 320 hexes in total.<br/>Each hex has a 50% chance of containing a world.<br/>On average there'd be 160 planets to calculate.<br/>Each world requires that you roll for Size, Atmosphere, Hydrographics, Population, Government, Law Level, Starport, and Tech level. You also have to work out travel codes and what bases are present, but those don't require rolls.<br/><br/>So, you're making 320 rolls to determine where the planets are, then on average a further 1,280 rolls to determine what those planets are like for a grand total of 1,600 rolls. And my utility does it all, including trade and communication routes, in less than a second. *sigh* if only I could get around the finishing it.

Nothing is actually "projected;" someone not wearing the glasses/goggles/contact lenses can't see the video overlay. In fact, sufficiently advance holographs would do the same thing, but let ANYONE see the AR (Augmented Reality).<br/>-----<br/>And this is all orthogonal. Assume SOME KIND of hardware and software tool which, when employed, can recognize real-world objects and then overlay graphics onto them to change their appearance or provide supplemental information about them, in real time. Miniatures are ARed with range and field of fire arcs; area of effect spells or powers appear on the battlemap for their duration, disappearing when the spell/whatever is finished (or the fire burns out or whatever). The Garou player actually have fur and fangs when I look at him, even though the player isn't even in costume, let alone makeup.<br/><br/>I'll add a few additional notions:<br/>* At a con, everyone's badge emits an RFID, which connects wirelessly to the con registration database which, in turn, provides AR information about the player's gaming interests, scheduled games, etc--whatever he or she would like to project for purposes of meeting folks and coordinating play. You view-click on folks and a halo of game logos pops over their heads (what they are/can play) with their con schedule appearing as a scroll unfurled over their right shoulder. (Yes, this would work in a singles bar scene, too; though the icons would be considerably more... um... what's the word...?)<br/><br/>* Any game which uses minis and which applies temporary conditions to them could do so as AR halos around the physical mini. D&amp;D has, what, umpty-six ways to tag, mark, stain, lather a unit, and folks hang garlands of braces rubber bands on them now, ya? So do it all with cool-ass AR effects: dripping blood, a bull's eye on its forehead, etc. Although...<br/><br/>* In those same games, all those modifiers would be factored by the computer doing the die rolling and Initiative management. Game Table with a "natural" interface of physical minis and (maybe) some bar-coded bases. Choose your action from a virtual pop-up menu, and the comp and AR graphics show you what you can do, then when you commit to an action, if it works and what the outcome is (which is immediately applied to the target(s)). This is, basically, what the mini game devs I mention above are doing (the one whose link i could not find).<br/>-----<br/>Anyhow, THAT's sort of what I'm hoping for in this thread. Pretend that you've got AR vision and audio enhancements, a powerful PC the size of a matchbox, and an unlimited budget: can you think of anything other than the obvious "make Dream Park?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213027/#Comment_213027" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T16:37:49+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  4:37PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2009 4:38PM by noclue.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just like geeking out on what Microvision Inc. is doing, beaming images directly onto the retina using LEDs.
