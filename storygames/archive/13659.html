I am however available for general ideas of other stuff to do and see here( and I can always use some practice giving tours, especially of the two main tourist attracting cemetaries in town).<br/><br/>Not SGing, but the D-Day museum sponsors a free to play WW2 themed wargame day one Saturday a month, so you might check their site out.<br/><br/>Also, one of the local comic shops was selling copies of <i>My Life with Master</i>, and from talking with the counter clerk, it is apparently at the behest of the owner, who'd like to see more of that stuff played. The shop was Crescent City Comics on Freret St. (contact= comix@crescentcitycomics.com ). It was the only thing other than MtG cards game related at the store.<br/><br/>There's apparently a decent minis gaming scene down here, but my job has precluded easy engagement with it. Katrina kinda wiped out the businesses and regular gaming meet ups I was familiar with when I lived here in the 90s... <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310525/#Comment_310525" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T21:16:05+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  9:16PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2011 9:16PM by PaulCzege.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Also, one of the local comic shops was selling copies of<i>My Life with Master</i>, and from talking with the counter clerk, it is apparently at the behest of the owner, who'd like to see more of that stuff played.

Leo McGovern, a cool <a href="http://antigravitymagazine.com/" rel="nofollow">indie zine publisher</a> picked them up from me at the <a href="http://halfmeme.com/" rel="nofollow">Half Meme Press</a> and <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/creamaliengames/" rel="nofollow">Cream Alien Games</a> table that Danielle and I did at <a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/" rel="nofollow">Staple</a> early last year.
