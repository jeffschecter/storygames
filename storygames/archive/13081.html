I didn't play because several people told me\u2026<br/><br/>- AW is grim like The Road. <b>\u201cIt\u2019s like walking around holding a loaded gun in your mouth</b>. You play till you decide to pull the trigger or someone else shoots you.\u201d<br/><br/>- AW is a <b>\u201ctraditional game done right!\u201d</b>. I have no idea what this means. <br/><br/>- No matter what you do, you roll 2d6 plus your stat and the results are always the same. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve positioned yourself to make the roll easier, or if the roll would be nearly impossible in the fiction, it\u2019s all the same. I was told this led to <b>people doing everything they could to avoid rolling</b> (like in Old School games\u2026 run away, attack, or convince the GM you don\u2019t have to roll). <br/><br/>- When you play AW, <b>you\u2019re playing the GM\u2019s story</b>. Which also means the GM has to do a lot of prep. And that GMing is hard!<br/><br/>- It\u2019s total immersion! You barely engage the mechanics and \u201cmoves\u201d are mainly structure freeform with <b>barely any mechanical weight</b>. <br/><br/>- Everything is prescriptive. It\u2019s very boardgame like. You <b>just say stuff when the dice tells you to</b>.<br/><br/>- It\u2019s very slow to play. It <b>doesn\u2019t become fun till the 6th session</b>. There is no scene framing. You follow characters around living their daily routine and see what happens.<br/><br/>- It\u2019s the best game ever (ok, I\u2019m a total hypocrite here as I get way over excited and praised Mouse Guard like crazy, I admit it!). But once I heard people describing <b>Moves as the most innovative thing ever</b> I started getting, probably unfairly, annoyed. I\u2019ve heard something called innovative that I\u2019ve played in other games 10 years ago too many times (plus innovation is overrated, it\u2019s how all the parts work together that excites me)! And I was starting to feel a D&amp;D 4E level of overly hopeful and blinding enthusiasm (sure there are all these problems in the 900 pages of rules but there is this one sort of vague page in the DMG that\u2019s buried under a pile of errata that makes it all go away\u2026 I\u2019m exaggerating but you get what I mean). <br/><br/>Well we played! <br/><br/>More after the commercial break!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294790/#Comment_294790" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T13:27:39+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  1:27PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These assertions are all amusing, mostly because I can't imagine how anyone who's actually read through the rulebook could really make any of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294795/#Comment_294795" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T13:42:24+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  1:42PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, the use of \u201clies\u201d in the subject is too strong. <br/><br/>I think it\u2019s at worst misinformation because the game is very new, people haven\u2019t fully read the rules, people played playtest versions where the rules were different, people played games where the GMs ignored certain key rules, and so on. Nothing malicious at all. I like everyone I\u2019ve spoken to about AW. But none the less, my play experience and reading of the rules didn\u2019t match the picture painted in my head. <br/><br/><br/>This thread is for anyone (like me) who decided AW was not for them based on possibly wrong assumptions. <br/><br/><br/>We\u2019ve played 6 times and overall really enjoy the game. It\u2019s not perfect. It\u2019s not the best game ever (no game is). The book itself could use a little re-organization (stress little) but by RPG standards is pretty good. The game itself is very clever and I feel accomplishes what it wants to do. It\u2019s not the most innovative game (but I think innovation is overrated) but it takes several concepts I really like from Vincent\u2019s previous games and clearly presents them as a cohesive whole. I think it\u2019s Vincent\u2019s best game and I love Dogs (I\u2019ve run it for over 100+ different people).<br/><br/>So what was I told about AW that after playing was untrue? <br/><br/>- AW is as grim or as hopeful as you want it to be. And even at its grimmest isn\u2019t that grim. It\u2019s not as grim as a game of Burning Wheel can be. And the characters you play are larger than life, sexy, powerful, smart, and kick ass. <br/><br/>- I believe when people say that AW is a \u201ctraditional game done right\u201d they mean something very nuanced. Lots of traditional games are purposefully designed to be toolkits (you can make any game into a toolkit, what I mean here is they are meant to be toolkits). And sometimes don\u2019t tell you how to play them. Or if they do, the play advice is disconnected from the rules themselves. Now a lot of people are down on traditional games but regardless of what you think of those games, many trad GMs are simply amazing. They know how to make any game into an event. I think what AW does is take a lot of what these amazing GMs do and pull those techniques directly into AW itself. Plenty of amazing GMs will read AW and say, \u201cso what?\u201d But in my opinion they take for granted how skilled and amazing they are. AW teaches the rest of us many of the techniques that these GMs use. <br/><br/>- You DO NOT just roll 2d6 plus your stat no matter what you are doing. I thought this and I hated it. But it\u2019s simply untrue. Not only does the fiction dictate what types of moves you make but previous moves can setup future moves and the moves are very different. <br/><br/>So if I want to take out a gang holding my cousin hostage, I don\u2019t want to just run out there guns blazing using Seize by Force. Even if I roll amazing, I\u2019m likely going to be hurt bad (I can minimize how hurt but likely still hurt, I am after all shooting at an entire gang with no cover). Instead I want to Go Aggro if I can to take out a gang member or two to start to even the odds (making the Gang smaller which means something mechanically). I can\u2019t just Go Aggro by rolling and if I want to position myself to be able to Go Aggro, I may need to Act Under Fire to get there. But if I describe myself fictionally in a position to roll Read A Situation, I can give myself bonuses to my Act Under Fire roll which can set me up for Going Aggro like finding out which target is most vulnerable to me and even scoping out an exit if I fail and need to run. The game feels like I\u2019m playing Metal Gear Solid, sneaking around and kicking ass! <br/><br/>Gear also gives bonuses. And it\u2019s not all prescriptive. I don\u2019t have to have a piece of Gear on my character sheet to use it. The game is descriptive\u2026 if I position myself in the fiction and it makes sense, I can get Moves or Gear or whatever that I don\u2019t normally have. The fiction matters! <br/><br/><br/>There\u2019s a lot more. Let me take a break here and come back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294797/#Comment_294797" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T13:47:13+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  1:47PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before I go on, I think my wife may like Apocalypse World too much!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at the Maker Faire this weekend and she on the spot decided to cosplay her character (although she's a Driver not a Chopper but there were no post Apocalyptic cars lying around)...<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="079.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/FTP/makerfaire/079.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="080.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/FTP/makerfaire/080.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="081.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/FTP/makerfaire/081.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="082.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/FTP/makerfaire/082.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="083.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/FTP/makerfaire/083.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="084.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/FTP/makerfaire/084.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="085.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/FTP/makerfaire/085.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294798/#Comment_294798" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T13:52:24+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  1:52PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on, John.<br><br>People talking about a game online can quickly turn in to a game of Telephone.

Then I heard that it was a lot like Poison'd, which I've come to hella respect but don't really have an interest in playing - so I decided not to pre-order.

But this isn\u2019t a GMless game (which is great in my opinion, it really benefits and takes full advantage of having a GM).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, after making characters, the first session is dedicated to finding out about the world from the player\u2019s perspectives. The GM asks a series of questions to fill out the world\u2019s details. Some of the characters themselves (Hard Holder, Chopper, Operator) let players explicitly define aspects of the world in character creation and by rolling certain moves at the beginning of a game. That said, the GM has plenty of input as well but this isn\u2019t a one sided affair!<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, NPCs are ridiculously fragile. If your NPCs get in the PCs way, they aren\u2019t going to last! Hell, the status quo is fragile. Every moment of play can drastically change the game. The game isn\u2019t static. Characters constantly change and a single failed roll can shake things inside out. That said, the rules keep and guide the GM from making random nonsensical things happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Yes, the GM must do prep. But it\u2019s well laid out and you have many tools to assist you. I haven\u2019t GMed but I would guess you can get away with 30-60 minutes of prep with less prep depending how play progresses. But you also don\u2019t have to stat out NPCs or threats the way players create characters. It\u2019s much faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I can\u2019t answer if GMing is hard. It\u2019s improv heavy (like most traditional games) but you have many tools to help if you\u2019re lost. The text explicitly tells you what to do if you\u2019re not sure what happens next. And lays out plenty of discrete options that are easy to reference. The book doesn\u2019t drop you into the middle of the ocean without a life raft. It\u2019s there for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The mechanics are light weight and flexible but they matter and more importantly are useful. Is using the mechanics better than making stuff up? I think so (although in some other games I\u2019d rather make stuff up). I think the mechanics drive you to make tough choices and say interesting things about what your character does that many people (not all) wouldn\u2019t do otherwise if they were just making stuff up.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Most Moves have mechanical weight. If succeed at Reading A Situation you can find out more about the fiction and gain bonuses to back up that knowledge. But at the same time, if you fail, the GM can make Moves against you. For example, the GM can turn the Move against you. Say you wanted to find out which NPCs is most vulnerable to you\u2026 well the GM can ask you which NPC YOU are most vulnerable to! And it\u2019s mechanically meaningful.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The game is prescriptive and descriptive. You can do stuff because it\u2019s on your character sheet or you can do stuff because it makes sense in the fiction. You don\u2019t have to mechanically be a Hard Holder to get a Hold if you can get one in the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The first session may be a little slow to play. But it\u2019s worth it. You\u2019re world burning except as you play. And it will make later sessions more engaging. And once you kick it to the next gear, the game flies by fast! You can level up almost every game if you make certain decisions. The fictional status quo can change in an instant. The game may even move to fast! But it isn\u2019t slow once you establish the basics.<br/>\n<br/>\n- There is scene framing. The GM can say, \u201cBob with the axe who was grimacing at you earlier is running at you with hate in his eyes\u2026 what the hell did you do to him?\u201d Note, the GM said \u201cBob with the axe who was grimacing at you earlier\u201d because the GM has to setup his Moves, there isn\u2019t just random stuff happening. And the player doesn\u2019t have to answer the GM (some players don\u2019t like this sort of play), they could simply say, \u201cI have no idea why\u201d and the GM could make the whole thing a misunderstanding or the manipulations of an old enemy or whatever. But first roll to not get hit by an axe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, one more break and then I\u2019ll wrap this part of the thread up. Lots of great comments so far,,, keep them coming!

I'm also getting the sense that that extent is pretty small.  Or, at least, AW is much more similar to the way I played in high school than, say, Burning Wheel is (to pick another game that has some strong "traditional" aspects).  <br><br>I suspect I'll learn a lot more the first time I try to do something that fictionally seems like it should work but isn't supported by the Moves my guy has.  Or maybe I'll just learn what my GM does in that situation.  As a player, I'm glad the GM process is opaque, but as a design nerd I'm filled with wonderings.  John's suggestion that it enables avg/uninspired GMs to play like great trad GMs would be a big deal (in my eyes) if true.  My gut says something like, "It'll help you get to the 80th percentile while preventing you from reaching the 99th" but that's just a hunch.<br><br>I do quite like the fact that my character came with followers and a few simple rules for how they can aid me and fuck with me.  Some characters seem to have a lot of good situation fodder baked right into them, which is a nifty alternative to "(a) make a character, (b) read the rulebook's or the GM's setting material, (c) depending on whether you did (a) or (b) first, plug characters into situations accordingly".  I've seen amazing greatness and utter shit fall out of that approach, and AW seems to at least reliably provide "NOT utter shit".<br><br>Pardon the slew of uninformed opinions.  "Trad gaming (and GMing) done right" is a matter that's close to my heart.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294859/#Comment_294859" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T01:12:05+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  1:12AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...and I had to respond to a thread full of Terry rockin' out on a bike.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294862/#Comment_294862" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T01:34:03+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  1:34AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played an earlier version of AW and whilst it was fun, there were big gaping holes in the rules. I've not played it since but I imagine I'll get round to it at some point because there were things in there that interested me (namely moves). That said I think AW is possibly the first game Vincent has written that has long term play interest for me. With Dogs the experience system happened too quickly and the trait bombing became a drag after one or two sessions with the same characters. <br><br>AW has slower experience (usually, I've heard of people racking up 20+ Hx in one session but even then that's nothing as compared to Dogs). Poison'd and Puppies are essentially the same kind of pushing the fictional envelope game which is fun for a session or two but it seems to me that AW does this in a much more tempered way. <br><br/>I forgot IAW. I wasn't convinced by the mechanic which got your character into the next session, it seems to me to encourage an early move followed by sitting back if you want to ensure continuity. The fiction was less strongly controlled than Dogs or AW and tended to get out of hand.<br/><br/>Obviously I'm glossing over the all kinds of awesome contained in these games.

We're 5 sessions in and the highest-improvement character has 4 improvements. The other 2 characters have 3 each. I feel like they roll a lot during sessions, but maybe it's just not their highlighted stats. In any case, it's fine, as long as they're doing things they care about. As (I believe) Vincent said somewhere, you kind of have to game the rolls to get 6 improvements by the 6th session (1 per).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294872/#Comment_294872" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T06:03:27+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  6:03AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It all depends on which stat you've got highlighted and your character.

It just depends on your group (highlighting stats) and the situations in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it's really easy to fix "too quick" improvement also. Just make it so you need 10 XP instead of 5 to improvement. Maybe after you mark your 5th improvement the XP scale increases to 10. Or, something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know one thing.

I would say mission accomplished! Going from starting GM to great GM is no small task and nothing replaces practice and knowing your players. <br><br>What's unique about Apocalypse World is the GM advice isn't just advice but actual tools embedded in the process of play. The GM has lists of things to do and say when a player misses a roll or the action is slowing down. This may lead to an experienced GMing reacting a bit slowly at first as they look through the lists of options but AW also makes the GM's job easier as statting NPCs is easy and the PCs roll everything. <br><br>There are a few parts where what to do will require practice. For example, an Act Under Fire weak hit means the player succeeds but is faced with an ugly choice. How clear that ugly choice is depends and I think takes practice to master (which I like, the work will be worth it). Where other moves results are more explicit.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294876/#Comment_294876" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T06:29:42+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  6:29AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>I played an earlier version of AW and whilst it was fun, there were big gaping holes in the rules.</blockquote>\nCool.

So all those rules and restrictions on MCing are, to me, super-interesting creative constraints. On the one hand I want to do X, but Ive signed up to play by the rules and the rules dont let me go straight to X...so how do I use the rules available to me to get there? That is where the fun is for me any more. <br><br>Not really sure that giving AW to a new GM as a training aid is actually going to teach them much else other than how to be a good AW MC.

Can any game be? Does it even need to be?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Gencon a few people asked me if Apocalypse World is the \u201cbest game ever\u201d (in a silly but semi-serious way) or if it\u2019s as good as D&amp;D; 4. Referring to how AW is as popular as D&amp;D; 4E was when it came out. But then a while later some of the enthusiastic people were down on D&amp;D.; Expectations seemed high with people bracing themselves for disappointment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently bought Castle Ravenloft and Space Hulk: Death Angel. Really great games\u2026 but Ravenloft\u2019s rules text is problematic and incomplete. Space Hulk rules text, specifically setup, is painful. And these are not cheap games and they are from 2 of the biggest game companies out there\u2026 Wizards of the Coast and Fantasy Flight!!! These are companies with a lot of money (relatively) and multiple full time professionals laboring on these games. Is Apocalypse World perfect? No. But relatively it\u2019s really good. And even though there may be a few minor organizational issues, I consider that a victory when it comes to RPGs!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo keep it in perspective, one person made Apocalypse World, drew, edited, and laid it out.  Now self publishing is not an excuse for quality control if you choose to sell a product at full cost. But Apocalypse World, despite any small flaws, is still better organized than many popular games by large companies. And you can get AW relatively cheap as a PDF for <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/105" rel="nofollow">$25!</a>  including Dogs in the Vinyard, kill puppies for satan, In a Wicked Age, Mechaton, <b>and</b> Poison\u2019d with free lifetime upgrades/revisions. That\u2019s crazy! I think for what it is, Apocalypse World delivers big.<br/>\n<br/>\n- What flaws?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s mostly subjective but we had a few minor issues when we played because we didn\u2019t read the entire book before playing. Instead we tried to start by reading it step by step together like you would a boardgame.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn The Characters chapter (p20), the character overviews have rules for character creation so we assumed we could just start making characters. The character descriptions here in some cases were unclear (like the Chopper) and were more flavor text than insights on who should play what and why. After we made characters, we moved to the next chapter, which was actually the Character Creation chapter (p96)!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe actual Character Creation chapter with its descriptions and warnings is excellent. If we read them before choosing characters we would have made different decisions (because certain characters are more active, while others reactive and different classes mix well together while others need more finessing to work in). If we just skimmed ahead it would have all been a non-issue. That said, character creation itself is a breeze and was one of my favorite character creation experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides that, the first 3 sessions we had confusion over when to use Going Aggro vs. Seize By Force (which is clearly explained on p197 but we missed it at first), sometimes forget to update HX, and even now often forget to roll the Harm taken rules. All relatively minor and nothing that makes the game stall (which is probably why we sometimes forget).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general it\u2019s been smooth sailing and the rules text is very easy to reference. And the included handouts are excellent (although there was reference to printing them out with no clear indication of where to get them if you don\u2019t have the PDF).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s pretty good. And by gaming standards it is very good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you loved Dogs but were iffy on In A Wicked Age (specifically the rules text), Apocalypse World may be for you. In many ways, I feel playing Apocalypse World teaches me how to play aspects of In A Wicked Age and Poison\u2019d.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Is Apocalypse World innovative?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow innovative it is doesn\u2019t make it less or more fun for me to play. But if this is important to you (and it can be if you are studying game design and want to pick up Apocalypse World to see what you can learn from it) I find how all the rules come together, how it\u2019s built to be easily hacked, and how the GM advice is integrated into the game mechanics and procedures to be brilliant. But some of the touted innovations (how players roll dice) exist in older games like Ispectres and Octane.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that covers everything I wanted to say!<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294932/#Comment_294932" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T10:22:33+00:00" title="September 28, 2010 10:22AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope that's helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\nStill have questions?

But that's as a group.  I would still love to play a Battlebabe, Chopper, Faceless, or Hardholder from the get-go, because they play really different from the other classes I've played so far (Angel, Operator, Hocus).  I'm thinking my Hocus may switch to Johnstone's "Damned" playbook soon, which has me excited about the character all over again.<br><br>In short, while playing 4E, over time, made me less excited about 4E, playing AW over time makes me appreciate the game more and want to play more of it (with new moves, with different people, with different characters), even when it feels like a particular game, group of characters, or whatever have been exhausted.  And the game realizes that and, right there in the rules, offers you the chance to switch characters or take on another one after 6 sessions or so, which is about where I normally get antsy in a campaign arc (of Bliss Stage or Mouse Guard) and look to wrap things up.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294950/#Comment_294950" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T11:35:25+00:00" title="September 28, 2010 11:35AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>If I want to run Apocalypse World for my group (I have the physical book and the PDFs), how much prep time do I need to start the first game?

It may in fact only confuse you, especially for moves like Going Aggro. Take special note of Acting with Violence p197 (which clears up do I Go Aggro or Seize By Force) and Reading a Sitch or a Person p203.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Not required, but it could be fun to talk about what kind of Post Apocalyptic books or movies your players are into. Maybe get together and watch one of the suggested movies under Media Influences p289.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>-1st session:</b><br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Have everyone read Character Creation p96-105 and maybe The Basics p11-17.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; The character class descriptions on the playsheets are mostly color. I would pay closer attention to the descriptions and warnings in Character Creation p96-105.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Make characters!<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Characters like the Hard Holder, Chopper, and Operator make the MCs life easier as they help define the world and initial situations through character creation. But certain character mixes may be challenging\u2026 a Hard Holder may want to stay in one place where a Driver or Chopper may want to go somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Follow the steps in The 1st Session p124-132, ask lots of questions, and take lots of notes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>-Between the 1st and 2nd session: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; The players would benefit from reading Basic Moves p190-208.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; The MC should read and follow the instructions in Fronts (prep between Sessions) 136-147.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt;At first prep may take 1-2 hours but later it can be as little as a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; I recommend the MC read the rest of the book or at minimum Moves Snowball (example of play) p152-158, Harm and Healing p160-175, Improvement p178-188, and Peripheral Moves p209-214.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; I recommend the MC and players browse through The Characters' Crap (gear, gangs) p236-265.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>- 2nd session: </b><br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; I recommend the MC reread Moves Snowball (example of play) p152-158 and The Master of Ceremonies (how to GM) p108-122.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Play your Fronts!<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Don't forget when you suffer Harm, roll+harm suffered p209.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Don't forget to update your Hx p207.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>-After the 2nd session:</b><br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Remember you can change Highlighted Stats p179.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Pay special attention to Prescriptive and Descriptive p178.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; Check out Advanced Fuckery p268-284.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\u2019s it!<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Apocalypse World lies! -

curious about this practice of not reading all the rules.<br/><br/>I read every rulebook twice from cover to cover before I attempt to run it.  I read AW, set it aside for a a few months and then read it twice more before I ran it and this worked well for me.  I really don't like it when I've been playing something a few sessions and then realize that I got a rule seriously wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294996/#Comment_294996" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T13:29:28+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  1:29PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's like a warm hug delivered over the ethernet.

Damn your eyes!</blockquote>\nI think the Basic Moves playsheet is great for reference once everyone knows how the Basic Moves work. <br><br>The playsheet doesn't have a lot of information that the Basic Moves chapter includes (p190-208) that is useful to know at first. But once you know, you don't need to reference it anymore (which is why they aren't on the playsheets). <br><br>For example, on the playsheet, under Go Aggro is says, "On a 10+, they have to choose: force your hand or suck it up." The GM knows what that means but the players who haven't read the Basic Moves chapter have no idea what "force your hand" or "suck it up" means. It's unclear that if I roll a 100% success threatening someone, that my target can either conform to my threats or call my supposed bluff and force me to commit violence.

In the show, there is a community that the main characters end up "working" for.  The community is safe from external harm and self sufficient in terms of food/water (Spoiler: <span style="color: #FFFFFF;">Its a military bunker under a mountain</span>).  It still has challenges of leadership, internal strife, moles, prisoners, and its influence in its region (Spoiler: <span style="color: #FFFFFF;">and colonies</span>).<br><br>I think that one way of handling this would be to have the hold be permanently freed from one specific type of threat.  Being free from each type of threat might prevent you from freeing it from another type of threat (e.g. free of hunger/thirst means you will never be free of external threats, free from external threats means you'll never be free of leadership struggles, free from disease means you'll never be free from refugees).  I think you'd have to set up a system where you could get 2-3 freedoms before being locked out.  Perhaps, when you choose to <i>retire your character to safety</i> or <i>change your character to a new type</i>, the MC could offer a custom move instead, e.g.when you <b>sacrifice leadership of your hold</b>, roll+hard.  On a 10+ choose 2 for your hold, on a 7-9 choose 1 for your hold. -Well -Greenhouse -Fortified -Innoculated -Orderly -Just.  This way, you can trade your control for the permanent betterment of your hold. [edit: implicit is the fact that you're telling the MC that you don't want to deal with these wants]                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295177/#Comment_295177" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T10:10:02+00:00" title="September 29, 2010 10:10AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I like that, although part of me says that's what the advanced moves are for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295181/#Comment_295181" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T10:49:45+00:00" title="September 29, 2010 10:49AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Going hungry...</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Hard Holder you roll your Wealth Move at the start of a session if your hold is secure and your rule unchallenged.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou roll+hard.

I kind of assumed each of the little bubbles was an option at first.  But clearly some of those don't make sense.  Removing 75-150 soul would make your hold what, empty?  So it's probably one of the "choose 4/choose 2" choices.  Which basically means the "choose 2" choices, most of which are removing a want.  I suppose a hold that doesn't have wants doesn't have much story potential.  Maybe just add "and your hold" to the retire to safety option?  Which is similar to what was suggested about giving up power, but once a hold isn't a player resource, its wants stop meaning anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295233/#Comment_295233" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T14:17:53+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  2:17PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone.
