One of my favorite things about Seattle of late has been the indie RPG community, specifically the Seattle Story Games meetup and its spinoff groups. I was wondering if there are any similar active groups in Boston - specifically inclusive clubs open to the general public that meet on a weekly basis exclusively to play story games, emphasizing respectful conduct between players. If I cant find any, I was thinking of starting an indie RPG meetup modeled after the one in Seattle following the good advice found on these forums and elsewhere, and would be interested in any interest in such a club.<br/><br/>I did some scrounging - so far I've found a group that looks like its now no longer open to the public <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/sgboston/info" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/sgboston/info</a>), and some general purpose RPG clubs affiliated with universities in the area. <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>- Max                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479433/#Comment_479433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-03T13:57:17+00:00" title="January  3, 2019  1:57PM">January 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have looked and hoped but not found such a group.

I think you will be able to find such a group (particularly in University towns). But I would say expect a bit of culture shock if you are dealing with local gamers. My impression is the Boston Game scene and the Seattle scene are very different. There isn\u2019t as much of a story game (though you can definitely find groups who are into it). I do think there is a good mix of play styles in the area. And some of the stuff around table etiquette (for example X cards) are not nearly as well recieved here\u2014-again going by my perception of the Seattle scene. <br/><br/>One cultural detail of you haven\u2019t encountered it yet: people bust each other\u2019s chops here. No one means any harm by it, it is just a way of having good conversation and bonding, but I think sometimes it strikes people from different regions as a bit rude.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479581/#Comment_479581" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-09T15:16:17+00:00" title="January  9, 2019  3:16PM">January 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One group I would recommend getting in contact with are the folks who run Games on Demand at PAX East.

Build it and they will come; more people are interested in indie RPGs then you may think. I and Ben Robbins were both very successful using Meetup. Use Meetup if possible; it costs money but after you get going you may be able to get regulars to contribute. Ben created <b>Story Games Seattle</b>, which he has retired but whose members have since produced further indie groups. I created the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/IndieRPGGuild/" rel="nofollow"><b>Indie RPG Guild</b></a>; feel welcome to steal anything from my Meetup site you find useful. <br/><br/>If you end up creating your own group and have any questions let me know. I\u2019m happy to answer them. Good luck <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>P.S. <br/>If you like GMless games; I suggest you limit them to some degree. I suggest you play <i>at least</i> 3 GMed games to every 1 GMless game. GMless games are typically more difficult to pull off and people can get frustrated. Ben was able to pull off a purely GMless group but that was because he had 3 factors working in his favor. 1) He has name recognition and is widely know as an indie game designer; 2) His group regularly played a small sub-set of games over and over so people could get used to them and good at playing them; 3) He was based in Seattle, which has a large population of people who are eccentric and like to try non-mainstream things\u2014a legion of pink-haired hipsters and hippies just pining to play a game of adult hid-and-seek in the library. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Also, I think it is a good idea to play plenty of GMed indie games that have a low failure rate, like <b>PbtA</b> games, and when you do play GMless games, play games like <b>Fiasco</b> or <b>Microscope</b>, which are more likely to produce successful sessions that are less creatively demanding because they give some structure rather than the expectation on improving without a net. <b>Fall of Magic</b> may also likely be a good choice for a GMless game. <br/><br/><b>Follow</b> could be worth trying out as GMless option, after the group gets more used to GMless games, but with some caveats. Follow is most successful when players stay close to the story archetype and genres the Quests are built for, and when everyone is committed to the same tone. Follow will automatically create creativity, so one shouldn\u2019t try to be overly clever or creative or try too much; doing so can often create a sprawling and unsatisfactory story. Just naturally build on each other\u2019s contributions instead of trying to force things or throw in  unexpected or clever twists. As stated above, Follow builds the creativity in the story automatically as an emergent property; it will arise naturally as the story unfurles. So to be successful in Follow: 1) Don\u2019t try too much, or try to be clever, just make a scene that would naturally follow from the previous one; 2) Agree on a tone and make sure players stick to it; 3) Focus on believablity; Gonzo is almost always a bad idea; 4) Keep the story focused and tight and build on other player\u2019s contributions; 5) Don\u2019t stray to much from the Quest\u2019s story archetype; staying close to the Quest\u2019s story archetype keeps players on the same page and telling the same story\u2014 archetypal stories are archetypal for a reason.<br/><br/>P.S.S.<br/>I have some great alternate success/failure rules for Follow if your interested. I also have some suggestions about how to approach and contextualize success/failure in Fiasco. With this approach to Fiasco my group has never had an unsuccessful session and we\u2019ve played it a lot.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479646/#Comment_479646" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-12T17:58:40+00:00" title="January 12, 2019  5:58PM">January 12</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2019 6:01PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited January 12</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479656/#Comment_479656" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-12T22:57:12+00:00" title="January 12, 2019 10:57PM">January 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/calm_max" rel="nofollow">calm_max</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>One of my favorite things about Seattle of late has been the indie RPG community, specifically the Seattle Story Games meetup and its spinoff groups</p></div></blockquote>\nIronically, I just moved to Cape Cod.

I hope that dispite the cultural differneces of the two cities, Boston will prove conducive to a story game meetup - I know that theater style LARP is really big in New England, giving me hope that the market is ripe enough with folks interested in plot based, offbeat, inclusive role playing.
