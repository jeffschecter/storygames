For my brother, we played Manna Hotel (he's a David Lynch fan), and for my 4th grade students we played through a kid friendly Dungeon Delve playset.

If you care about making great stories with your friends, that's the only qualification for that you need in my book. Part of the reason you hear a lot about it is simply because it's been around a while, at least in terms of the story game revolution. And it is  quite good. It's not everyone's cup of tea - it's a little crunchy - but it's well-designed and does what it sets out to do very well. Next time you're at a con, try it out and see if it's for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400738/#Comment_400738" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T18:18:42+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  6:18PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yet another vote for Fiasco.

Warm-up games are great! For my recent game of Fiasco we played a game of <a href="http://www.gizmet.com/games/fluffybunny.html" rel="nofollow">Fluffy Bunny Tea Party</a> which worked grand. However any board/card game which encourages a bit of roleplaying, storytelling, or at least lots of talk is good for this. Other examples are <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12692/gloom" rel="nofollow">Gloom</a> which works best when you expand upon the cards with a bit of  story, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit" rel="nofollow">Dixit</a>, and there are others that I am forgetting about at the moment. Just steer away from any heavy strategic game where everyone is silent concentrating on their next move as you want everyone in a talky mood.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400739/#Comment_400739" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T19:04:13+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  7:04PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeons &amp; Dragons works really well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400742/#Comment_400742" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T19:34:16+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  7:34PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Dungeons &amp; Dragons works really well.</blockquote>\nThe numbers would seem to back this up.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400764/#Comment_400764" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T22:49:38+00:00" title="December 13, 2012 10:49PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had success in a similar scenario with running Lady Blackbird so I'd add a vote for that if you have the bodies to do it.

Perhaps half of the playtesters of my game (of 21 playtests \u0e23\u0e01 2-4 players each) has been non-gamers, and it worked swell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400786/#Comment_400786" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T05:17:53+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  5:17AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game you sit down with them to play that you believe will have the highest likelihood of keeping them wanting more is one you dearly, dearly love yourself.

Then you pick some games from your shelf that you like, and that might fit their tastes. Then you pick one of them together after talking about them a bit.<br/><br/>If you turn the question around so it's about something else, it becomes easier to see, I think. Say you were going to show a movie to someone who'd never seen movies before! You wouldn't say "this is the perfect movie for recruiting beginners" - you'd say "Well, I know she likes SF books and fantasy comics, and I like the first Star Wars movies and Alien and The Hobbit, so I'll tell her about those to find one that suits her".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400819/#Comment_400819" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T10:15:39+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 10:15AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2012 10:16AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this depends hugely on the social circumstances and how much time you have.<br/><br/>Given a large group that wants to hang out and have a laugh (and, say, likes to be loud and drink) for an hour or so, I'd choose one type of game. For a couple of close friends who are honestly interested in this whole "story game" idea and want to experience it fully, and are willing to commit to a 3 or 4-hour session over two weeks to really see what it's all about.<br/><br/>There was a great "5-minute" one-on-one intro to roleplaying someone posted. Maybe John Harper? I can't remember. You were an investigator interrogating a mechanic at an auto repair joint about a murder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
