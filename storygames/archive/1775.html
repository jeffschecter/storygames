<div class="Message">
                    I was at MACE this past weekend, slinging around some promotional postcards on IPR's behalf.  Gratifyingly, I saw several of them get examined closely and then tucked into folks' bags/binders/what-have-you.  <br/><br/>I also had a few IPR-tangenting conversations with folks around the con which have echoed ones I've heard elsewhere.  There seem to be two kinds of comments that are sticking out for me, one generic, one specific, and they go like this:<br/><br/><b>Generic:</b> <i>Variations on the theme of...</i><br/>"Man, the only place I look for games these days is IPR."<br/><br/><b>Specific:</b><br/>"I would totally buy __________, if only it was for sale on IPR."<br/><br/>________ so far includes me hearing at least one incidence of; my spotty memory suggests to me that it may be multiples on all of these:
<ul><li>Agon<br/></li><li>Perfect<br/></li><li>My Life With Master<br/></li><li>1001 Nights</li></ul>
So, story-gamers, tell me -- what other games might you buy, <i><b>if only they were on sale at IPR</b></i>? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b><span style="color: #CC0000;">EDIT: So, rather than deciding that I'm going for some sort of passive-aggressive peer-pressure angle on these games, please trust that I'm openly trying to gain insight into what products aren't reaching a portion of their potential audience.  I am the sort of guy who sees something that works and genuinely wants to try to bring it to help other people out.  Consider that I have recently worked with Chad Underkoffler talking about potentially getting his stuff on IPR; I'm doing this as a positive-minded, good-hearted advocate, and I'd appreciate not being assumed to be some sort of a dick absent of actual evidence of dickery in my intentions.</span></b> </div>

                            Well, Agon and 1001 nights are on my list, as is Ganakagok. <br/><br/>It's not so much that I <i>won't</i> buy them from Lulu (or Meguey, for 1k1n), it's that I'm more than passingly lazy, and for the moment IPR already feeds me more indie goodness than I can keep up with. If they were at IPR, they could become part of that 'more than I can keep up with' stream, but since they're not, they get to wait until I <i>do</i> catch up.                        </div>

                            For the record, things being exclusively on IPR actually makes me slightly less likely to order them as the shipping policies (at least in the past) make it rather a pain for me to get IPR goods in good time and good order.                        </div>

<p>I think this says a good something about Brennan that people are saying that at all. On the other hand, I think Paul's doing just fine without it. I sell a lot fewer copies of my games than IPR does, but from me, people often request that their games be signed or that they be sent to Europe.</p>
<p>IPR does not answer all problems. It's one organization. If you're looking to IPR for all of your gaming recommendations, you're missing out on a lot. Brennan has standards to which he holds the games he sells. I'm not going to tell you that they're not good standards; he sells my games like hotcakes, so I benefit from his vetting process in the extreme. But it <em>is</em> Brennan's taste. If there's a game that Brennan doesn't think is up to snuff for one reason or another, but you'd really dig it, you will miss it. Likewise, sometimes designers don't want to be under Brennan's wing* for one reason or another, even though he wants them so bad he pees a little. You're missing those, too.</p>
<p>* One very good reason is that, if someone buys a game from me, they hit my <a href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/" rel="nofollow">blog</a>, they hit <a href="http://glyphpress.com/discussion/" rel="nofollow">xenoglyph</a>, and I have contact with them. When they buy through Brennan, they don't. I don't precisely know why this is, but I think the lack of personal contact matters a lot.</p>

Yes, Brennan has said as much.<br/><br/>I have to be honest and say that IPR shipping is <i>really damn fast</i> though.  I mean, 3-4 days.  But adding $10 to the cost of a $20 book makes it a $30 book.  Which is too much, especially when I can often order the same thing from it's creator for much less.<br/><br/>I think there's also a certain problem that a lot of us foreigners perceive a lack of interest in having non-US customers from a lot of US based retail websites, not just IPR.  I mean, the whole "Free domestic shipping if you spend over $25!" thing is great and all, but how come an American's shipping cost goes down when he spends more while my shipping cost goes up when I spend more?  How's that supposed to make me feel?<br/><br/>Sorry, rather off-topic of me...                        </div>

When they buy through Brennan, they don't. I don't precisely know why this is, but I think the lack of personal contact matters a lot.</blockquote>
Yep.  As it happens, I agree with a lot of your points, Joshua.<br/><br/>The personal contact angle is a key aspect of marketing yourself as a small-press dude.  That's why I try to reach out to as many of Evil Hat's games' fans directly.  The purchaser definitely gets a thrill of direct creator-contact.  But that happens for vocal purchasers whether they've bought through IPR, from me at a con, or, say, by one further degree of remove, like with Leisure Games out in the London area (who buy my games through IPR).  But really, this tangent is worth a topic thread all on its own (and I have already talked about it to some extent on my LJ).<br/><br/>For me, I don't do ANY direct sales save in person, at cons.  I don't want to mess with fulfillment and shipping, because I know it's a job I'll fall down on.  I'm pretty sure that without IPR, I'd have sold perhaps 5-10% (and that's not an exaggeration) of Evil Hat's present sales volume.<br/><br/>So I'm happy with them and I like sharing my happies.  Thus this thread.                        </div>

What about me! Jebus, am I invisible!<br/><br/>No wait, I know what it is -- I'm Canadian. No one ever notices Canada. We're only the second largest country in the fucking world, but becuase we're right next door to America we're fucking invisible. <br/><br/>Which makes it even more annoying when we have to pay more money for shipping from the States. I'm like 15 feet from New York state, and yet to get books to me it tripples my shipping costs. Fucking national borders. They should just get rid of those things and let us wander freely, like we did in the caveman days. <br/><br/>(If you are reading this post seriously, stop it. My only real point is that even when the "overseas shipping" is only "over Lake Ontario" it still can be annoying. I have all IPR stuff sent to my folks in Cali and then pick it up twice a year when I'm down there. Which rather limits the number of times a year I buy stuff from IPR. Significantly those who have a .pdf and hardcover policy are more likely to get my money in a faster way.)                        </div>

Nothing.<br/>

No, that's not passive-agressive or acusatory, either. I just see no particular advantage to ordering from IPR over any other venue. I think that Brennan's value add is to the seller, not the customer.<br/>
<br/>
Or am I missing something? I mean, I'm as lazy as Albert about my game purchasing, or moreso (I actualy wait till I'm at GenCon standing there with money in my hand). And that hasn't got me thinking that I should only go to IPR...<br/>

I'd find it strange that anybody would think this at all.<br/>

                            I'll confess to being one of the folks hoping for more offerings on IPR. Yes, I'm American. Yes, I like the "free domestic shipping for orders over $25," especially compared to whatever the author offers directly. I'd like to buy from my FLGS, but until they begin carrying more indie games, which I suspect will likely involve ordering from IPR, I'm looking at web orders or cons. So far, I've bought stuff on IPR and at GenCon. Generally, I don't buy stuff from individual (i.e. non-IPR) sites, because my dollar goes farther on IPR. It may be Koolaid, but it's tasty and cheap Koolaid. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>Paul, I'd like to buy your game. I don't think you should stop selling directly, and I realize there are business considerations involved in selling through IPR. I hope you are able to resolve those difficulties, because I am <i>more likely</i> to order your game through IPR than directly. First, because I look at IPR regularly, so not being there gets into out-of-sight-out-of-mind territory, and second, because I like taking advantage of the free shipping over $25. Your site states that you are currently out of stock on MLWM; please post to Story Games when you get more in stock.                        </br></br></div>

Well -- setting the well-founded international shipping concerns stated above aside -- I think to some extent it's a case of aggregate shipping costs, in the minds of these folk.  They want to buy their $100 to $200 worth of games at once and pay no domestic shipping on it, rather than buy those games piecemeal from multiple websites that they had to hunt down and potentially pay some shipping considerations on each of those purchases.  Taken in aggregate, that money spent on shipping or whatever at the individual sites might have gotten them a fifth or sixth game...<br/><br/>But I don't think most of the (vocal) readers on this thread are all that interested in this perspective.<br/>I think I may have mis-targeted Story Games as the locus of this thread.  Maybe I should take this sort of question over to where it's more of a consumer's board rather than a designer's/insider's board.                        </div>

Exactamundo, that's it right there -- the foundation of my aggregate experience that lead me to start this thread.<br/><br/>Hell, I'd also like to start thinking about how we can, on IPR, offer cross-publisher bundles.  I've recently encouraged Chad Underkoffler to start selling his stuff on IPR in the hopes that I can do, say, 'Buy Spirit of the Century AND Truth &amp; Justice at 10% off!' (and we'd split the 'cost' of the discount, or somesuch).<br/><br/>IPR has a kind of "United, We Rock" vibe going for me, and I'd love to start taking more deliberate advantage of it.  But this is all speaking to my down-the-road intentions.  In starting the thread, I was just interested in the perspectives of folk who aren't buying games when they're not on IPR, since my pattern recognition sense kicked it up to the top of my brain as a regular occurrence.                        </div>

I disagree: I think more actual play is likely to occur if more books get into more hands. Anything in service to that notion helps - if another byproduct is more profit, great!<br/><br/>Also, I feel a bit left in the cold: what if I just want to read your book (because that's what you do with books, at least at first)?                        </div>

                            IPR does indeed add value for the buyer, if the buyer likes to buy from a retail store. It is possible for those few stores that are motivated to carry indie games to work with you if you're not with IPR, but it's harder.                        </div>

I may not be able to do anything about them, but I'd rather know they're out there.

There are people who visit IPR who don't go to Story Games or The Forge or any of the other online indie designer stomping grounds, and it isn't only retailers who are glad for a central place to order more than one publisher's game.<br/><br/>Whether or not that makes you want to list your game with IPR is still a personal decision.                        </div>

                            I love IPR for the reasons that Matt Gandy spilled out above.<br/><br/>I don't follow blogs and the like all that often (save for a few friends, but I already know what they're working on). As I get deeper into this Tenra project (after talking to Luke this last weekend I've shifted gears from "1st" to "4th") I'm going to have even less time to devote to following the latest and greatest out there. So for my own personal shopping, IPR and Key20 are really working for me. At IPR, when I visit once every 2 weeks or so, I constantly am reminded of 2-3 games on my "Must Buy Later" list, and so I keep them in mind.<br/><br/>Key20 is cool too, as I find some crazy stuff that I've never even heard of, ANYWHERE. Indie stuff that's hardcore indie, and yet never has passed by The Forge (Noumenon, for example). I Never would have found some of these games were it not for the likes of Key20, and next year, the same will be true for IPR (I know all the games there now, but by next year I won't know the new stuff, having taken a step 'into the shadows' as it were to get my own stuff done).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Primetime Adventures still isn't on IPR, and it makes me sad, because I know the Endgame folks are into the game and would like to be putting it in front of their RPG customers. They may find a way to do so anyway, but it'll be at the expense of that much more of their buyers' time and effort, and that puts the game on a shakier footing with them than it'd have otherwise.                        </div>

Nah, you shouldn't.  So, tell you what, since I believe in putting money where my mouth is.<br/><br/>I believe in My Life With Master, and I think it could sell very well on IPR.  Evil Hat will happily front you $500 to get over the liquidity problem; order up as many MLwMs as you can cover with $500 and ship 'em over to IPR to be sold under IPR's usual terms (you'd have to work out the contracty bits with Brennan).  Out of the first however many copies that sell from that initial order, pay Evil Hat back.  If you don't sell enough to cover it, that's Evil Hat's risk and I'm ready to accept the loss.  However, I think you'll sell enough to cover that and then some -- enough to cover another same-sized order to restock IPR once it runs dry.  Better yet, since I'll now have a vested interest in MLwM selling enough to cover that $500, I'll be pushing folks to go buy your book.  That's right: I'm saying I'll loan you $500 for the privilege of being your salesperson.<br/><br/>Does that reduce your discomfort factors enough to get you on board?  If so, let me know.                        </div>

                            I'd be happy if everyone's cool games were on IPR, if only because my birthday was shortly after GenCon.  I assumed that books would soon be going up on the site but that they hadn't gotten over the post-gencon rush yet.  So I sent family and friends there with a list of cool games. (Mostly culled from excited post gencon blog/story games/etc. discussion.)  When some of the games weren't offered through IPR, I heard about how difficult I can be to shop for.<br/><br/>Being greedy, I like sending them a link to IPR with a list of games.  Now that I know that some books must be purchased elsewhere, I'll send direct links for those games to my shopping minions for Christmas.                        </div>

                            As an individual consumer ("Be happy!  Buy more!") I have bought from IPR but no more than from other sources accessible online.  However, they do have one very neat feature that affects me indirectly: their policies make it easy for FLGS to buy a few samples of a wide range of games at good cost.  My FLGS (The Dreaming in Seattle, which totally rocks and strongly supports small-press games) recently set up an account and ordered a bunch of games.  Most of the lot were titles that I had been considering but wasn't sure enough to gamble on; being able to leaf through them helped me pick which ones were good fits.  Yes, I bought them from the FLGS; in fact, they immediately had to reorder because titles were flying off the shelves.  :-)  So I think that is one incentive for small-press folk to regroup, whether under IPR's banner or another comparable arrangement.                        </div>

                            Thanks Fred, but I don't actually have liquidity problems. Half Meme Press has money in the bank. And no, I'm not advocating against IPR. Quite the contrary, in fact. I cannot now imagine hiring any other fulfillment service when/if it becomes necessary. I've posted to this thread for one purpose only: to rebut the sweeping presumption that we're all doing this for the same primary reason which is success in a capitalist endeavor. (In fact, the main reason I started designing was that no one was creating and publishing the kinds of games I wished I could be buying. And now, a few years later, I've got more games I want to play than I have time.)                        </div>

                            I'm not on IPR - yet. I actually really like going down to see David and Grechen at the PO. I like getting notices from PayPal. I like e-mailing my customers when their book has shipped. Would I get more sales on IPR? Sure. Would I feel like I was missing out? Probably. Will 1001 Nights wind up on IPR? Still on the fence. It's really awesome (<i>Nathan, you've created a monster</i>) to down-load $$$ from PayPal to pay my student loan, or cover a dinner out, or whatever. With IPR, I'm out that really happy little stream on cash flow.                        </div>

                            Joshua, if it's me you're referring to there... I was asking the question because Paul is an experienced person and I am not, and I thus feel like understanding his position could do me a lot of good. I didn't mean to "get in his business" so much as to understand something that he's saying, which I might then take and apply to my distribution decisions.<br/><br/>I just wanted to understand where he was at, and I had the feeling something wasn't being vocalized.<br/>Sorry if I was prying too much, Paul.                        </div>

                            Back to the original question: something being on IPR or not has basically no impact on purchasing decisions.  I'm in the US so I don't have shipping problems, but I purchase so few products that the chances of me bumping over to free shipping are pretty low.  I'll buy what I want to buy wherever it's available.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

Note that it was to the sole extent of finding out if I could reduce the resistance.  Now I know I can't.<br/><br/>Why was I doing it?

                            I'm getting involved with indie RPGs at my FLGS. The owner ordered 15 games I was interested in from IPR. The ones I don't buy right away (i.e., most of them) are going to go on the indie shelf. I'm going to run some game demos and possibly write some reviews or articles for the mailing list to generate interest for the demos. Hopefully this will result in more games stocked at the store, more sales, and (selfishly) more actual play for me.<br/>
<br/>
It'd be much harder to arrange something like this if the store had to deal with 15 separate small publishers instead.                        </div>

                            Yes. A few individual publishers with games in high demand can go it alone with retailers, and it's fine. The whole crowd can't. (But now we are really not germane to the thread)                        </div>

                            I gotta say from my own perspective as someone who stocks a bunch of titles, it's SO much easier to deal with one source, than many small publishers. I do both, but have a preference for making my ordering process easier. Not that my $.02 were needed, there they are.<br/>

                            I like seeing games on IPR because as a central location for them, it is the store front. I can then follow the links to home pages and read what the creators have to say too. I couldn't hope to find them if they weren't publicised some way, and IPR does that job for me.<br/><br/>I think MLwM is in a special position because it was around before IPR and has been widely publicised across the hobby as a groundbreaking game. Indie games now are tend to be less groundbreaking, mainly for the simple reason that there are more of them around and they get less publicity each, being in a more crowded market. I occasionally drop by at Half Meme to see if Paul has anything new out, much as I do at Lumley.com but I tend not to visit that many other creator websites unless I see something on IPR.                        </div>

                            I bought a bundle of stuff from IPR when they had their "big sale" or whatever, about half a year ago; I think that was what got me to suck up the horrific shipping cost thing (I understand other Israelis buy their Indie games direct from the designer or as PDF).<br/>I got Dogs, Burning Wheel, Mountain Witch and the first two Sorcerer supplements. I would have been tempted to get <b>PTA</b> and <b>Dead Inside</b> if those were available (I'm pretty sure PTA was out of print and Dead Inside wasn't on IPR), but it was a big purchase anyway (because of the darn shipping costs), and I cut back on some stuff (Breaking the Ice and something else, I forget what).                        </div>

                            I also use IPR, pretty exclusively, just because I tire of hunting down specific game producers, especially when sometimes their answer is Lulu where the shipping is even more prohibitive.                        </div>

                            There is no product I would not buy if only it were available at IPR, assuming I can still order it direct from the author. That's just a bizarre question. I mean, I think Brennen and all are swell guys, and I dig IPR, but I seriously can't imagine a situation where someone would actually say, "Awesome. I need to buy that. What? I can't get it from IPR? Well FUCK him! I didn't need that stupid game anyway!"<br/>
<br/>
The only edge IPR gives a product in my eyes is in the situation where I'm a few bucks short of the free shipping limit, I might tack on something cheap I wouldn't have otherwise ordered. But that doesn't have anything to do with any specific product. Ditto for sale prices.<br/>
<br/>
I think the more useful question would be, "What games did you first learn about by seeing them on IPR?" 'Cause you can't buy a game you haven't heard about, so in that way IPR could facilitate the original question.                        </div>

I understand your perspective, but look back to my original post.  This is based in real observations of stated opinions of prospective buyers who are not buying products that aren't on IPR.  This thread has (so far) done a fine job of examining that phenomenon, ranging anywhere from denial that it's even a valid approach to purchasing (fascinating) to "yep, that's how I look at it".                        </div>

<br/>
As a customer, I really like that IPR gives you free shipping for orders &gt;= $25.<br/>
<br/>
What that usually means is that I have in mind a list of products I'm "kinda jazzed" about.  Then, when I want to buy a product that I'm "super-jazzed-right-now" about from IPR and it costs &lt; $25 I flip through my list for something to make up the difference.  Saving that shipping makes me feel good about spending the money and helps take a lot of products that I'm on the fence about over the top.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I recently purchased Agon.  I went to IPR looking for it, thinking I could bundle it with Lacuna, 2nd Attempt, but it wasn't there.<br/>
<br/>
Total cost if both had been on IPR: Agon ($20) + Lacuna 2nd ($15) = $35.<br/>
Total cost of Agon + cheapest possible shipping from Key 20: $27.21.<br/>
<br/>
So I looked at spending nearly $30 for Agon and thought, nah.  Instead I bought the PDF and printed it out at work (which I can do for free when I'm there after hours fixing other people's bugs -- plus they have an old skool spirabinder so I can make pretty bound booklets) and that was that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, make of that what you will.  Or not.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                            Here's how it's worked out for me, as a relatively new indie gamer.  I've ended up buying a bunch of stuff on IPR that I might not have bought otherwise -- or might not have bought as quickly -- because of the ease of the purchase.  I went on IPR two weeks ago to get a second copy of TSOY for my younger brother, because I think he'll dig it, and ended up going, "Hey, what the hell, while I'm at it..." and bought The Prince's Kingdom, The Mountain Witch (and Kwaidan), and a copy of Roach as a gift for my boyfriend.  Now I'm planning on running The Mountain Witch soon, and also trying to figure out if I can work The Prince's Kingdom into a program at my library (the answer to this is sadly, probably not, due to time constraints).  I did kind of the same thing a couple months ago when I decided to shell out for my own copy of TSOY and impulsively picked up DitV as well, justifying it with the free shipping.<br><br>What basically happens is that I start out looking for one thing, run across a designer's name or the name of the game, and go "Oh yeah, I was thinking the other day that sounded cool..." and then I buy the game.  I think that's the main advantage.  It's not that I'm not going to go out of my way to purchase something that sounds cool, it's more that unless it's the thing I'm specifically shopping for (as in, "I need a copy of TSOY for my brother") I'm probably not going to buy it on a whim.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hey, I was completely unaware of that Timfire Kwaidan. That is one smart bundle.                        </div>

                            Incidentally, once I'm done with my holiday shopping for others, I'm going to buy myself a buttload of indie games off IPR that I haven't been able to afford.                        </div>
