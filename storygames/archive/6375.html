I think that it's interesting when expectations collide. I play for practically nothing but that, in fact. I don't mind when players play a stereotype of a race, if that's what's fun. But I really love it when we see how the character varies from the norm. The Ferengi that finds a way to mutate his greedy philosophy to help people he obviously cares for (Quark). '<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's the most interesting thing about Gimil (Hint: it's ommited from the movie)? *<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the real problems with these stereotypes is that it can easily lead to "My Guy" play where a player gets away with annoying other players because he's "just acting the way that race would act." Like the rambunctious dwarf who behaves so haphazardly that he threatens the party's well-being in a way intended to get other PCs killed. Reasoning, "Well, a dwarf would just charge in here, right?"<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically avoiding making the character a protagonist by appealing to plausibility. When there are infinite other plausible options that would make the character a protagonist. When a player plays a stereotype in my games, we reward them for when that's fun stuff, but with the understanding that the portrayal is a stereotype, and that it serves to actually highlight that otherwise their race is a race of individuals. If the character is a "dwarf's dwarf" then that says that not all of them are, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n*Answer: he falls in love with Galadriel's gift of hair.

And that is something vital I felt that the movie lacked (and was included in the extended DVD).<br/><br/>Most of the time I like "breaking the cliche". What makes your character be different than the rest of your race? Are you a greed-less dwarf? A rational half-orc? A non-curious gnome? You might be just like the stereotype, but as long as there is one or two things that set you apart, there is plenty of room for interesting role playing and story hooks.<br/><br/>Why was it that Spock's occasional display of emotions were so strong and powerful?<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, I love those "out of the mold" characters.

I always kind of dug how <i>Talislanta</i> had seven dozen different races, and <i>some</i> of them might have been various fantastic variations on the human species, though it was never very clear (at least to me) just who was human, and who was human-<i>like</i>.  And then, of course, there's the Ven in <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>, who I'm still trying to pin down as humans or elves or Melnibon\xe9ans or what.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that I really dig the idea of eliminating the middle-of-the-road, racial-stat-benchmark humans who specialize in nothing but "adaptability", and I think one way to do that is to, if not eliminate humans all together, then at least diversify them in such a way that there isn't an obvious "normal" racial choice left (see "<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMario" rel="nofollow">The Mario</a>").<br/><br/>Or, of course, you could just force give humans as a species some actual traits and themes just like other fantasy races have.  But I kind of like the idea of the word "human" not even being on the list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141127/#Comment_141127" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T12:14:51+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 12:14PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2008 12:16PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I would say that in fantasy humans aren't usually presented as a "blank slate" option.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D they are versatile and adaptable.<br/>In Roddenberry Star Trek they are diplomatic and moral.<br/>In World of Darkness they are vulnerable and ignorant.<br/>In Babylon 5 they are diplomatic and bold.<br/><br/>I remember seeing humans painted as warlike, clever, and other personality niches as well in other settings.<br/><br/>But, that aside, it's certainly an option not to have them.

Other animals are always faster, stronger, tougher and more agile than a human. However, in reality, human endurance is superior to almost any other landbound creature. Certain African tribes practice a form of hunting which involves repeatedly spooking an antelope and walking after it -- after a day or two, the antelope runs out of energy and can no longer flee. Wolves have comparable endurance, but no terrestrial animal is clearly better at this than humans. Humans also have the ability to throw things far and accurately, which is almost unique among Earthly animals. Our manipulative skills thanks to our hands and opposable thumb are superior to any other terrestrial animal and our vocal cords, mouth and tongue gives us a vocal flexibility few other animals can match. And even without special equipment humans can climb trees, scale mountains and dive underwater. We have color vision superior to any mammalian excluding our primate cousins.
