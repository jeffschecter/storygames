I've been lurking for a couple of weeks - and there's lots of story-game goodnees here, so thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm the SG for a TSoY game with some friends.  We've reallly just sort of taken it out for a spin on two occasions - each lasting about ninety minutes.  We all like it a lot, so we're going to make a campaign of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe want to make sure we're playing as close as we can to the rules-as-written, and that leads me to a couple of questions that I hope you all can help clarify:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Can the players kill a named NPC without BDtP?  I'm 99% certain the answer is "no" based on the rules text, but wanted to make sure.<br/>\n2) Can an SGC have as their intent, "Kill this pc" outside BDtP?  Again, I'd say yes, b/c it says as much in the rules, but the part where Mr. Nixon says that named NPCs can't be killed without BDtP makes me wonder, so I'm just checking.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJason                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82564/#Comment_82564" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-21T08:11:55+00:00" title="July 21, 2007  8:11AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/><br/>As I understand it, BDtP is the only way to <i>permanently</i> remove an NPC from play.  So first of all, that doesn't automatically mean death.  You could just "banish" him or something.  Secondly, that means that you <i>can</i> kill an NPC without BDtP, but, if the SG wants to, he can bring him back by whatever means.<br/><br/>As for "Kill this PC" as an intent, that's fine.  If the player of that PC loses and is fine with that, then he's dead.  However, since players have the option to BDtP, they probably will, so it's moot.<br/><br/>I hope that's helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J.Leigh" title="J.Leigh"><img alt="J.Leigh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J.Leigh">J.Leigh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82565/#Comment_82565" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-21T08:19:17+00:00" title="July 21, 2007  8:19AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D'oh!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd read the rules about being able to bring an NPC back differently than that.

If you lower the stakes to the point where either outcome is interesting and satisfying, you'll have more nuanced conflicts.  You want him dead?  Set the stakes at his imprisonment, pending show trial.  Just a general suggestion.  Oh, and remember that you can change your intention in bringing down the pain.  <br/><br/>I've had NPCs bested with lethal stakes outside of bringing down the pain, and brought them back with a story of miraculous survival...everyone <i>thought </i>he was dead, but somehow he clung to life...now some of my friends will do this quite deliberately, because the sudden reveal of a returned NPC is so fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J.Leigh" title="J.Leigh"><img alt="J.Leigh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J.Leigh">J.Leigh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82617/#Comment_82617" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-22T17:26:26+00:00" title="July 22, 2007  5:26PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason:<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!

But honestly? They're not really interested in dragging out a combat for 30 minutes of BDTP: They don't find him THAT interesting. They want to kill him and go back to the Castle, where they all have awesome Story-Things to do.<br/><br/>So a Player says "I kill the Merchant". Friends give him Friend Dice, he expends some Pool Points, and BLAMMO, the player rolls higher than the GM: The Merchant is DEAD. PERIOD.<br/><br/>DEAD.<br/><br/>The PCs give each other high-fives and go back to the story.<br/><br/>The players didn't find the Evil Merchant very interesting. The GM, however, really likes the Evil Merchant character, and doesn't like that the Evil Merchant was punked in one blow.<br/><br/>Now, because the author of the game is a sharp guy, he created a little "Mini Veto" mechanic in the game, so that the players don't ALWAYS take "the easy way out" by boosting their stats and taking one killing swipe (physical, social, etc). <br/><br/>That Mini Veto is in the form of the sentence that reads something to the extent of, "Only BDTP can remove a character from play For Good".<br/><br/>What that means is, in the above, the Merchant was Killed... or at least, that's what the PCs thought.  They stabbed him, the Merchant fell over, and the PCs went to town for brewskis. The merchant, though, in the story, wasn't dead. Maybe he got knocked into a coma. Maybe he was just playing. Or maybe an NPC body-double of the merchant was killed, while the real merchant lives on.<br/><br/><i>If the GM wasn't really attached to that NPC anyway, then sure, yeah, he died with that one-hit roll.</i><br/><br/><b>But</b>, if the GM thinks that that NPC should really be given more airtime, that going out in one hit doesn't satisfy for his cool pet character, then that Mini Veto of BDTP means that the GM has the option of bringing the Merchant back later, if he wants to.<br/><br/>For the sake of communication and setting expectations, that usually means a few things in the above Evil Merchant example:<br/><br/>1) The Evil Merchant (unless there's some really good surprise that demands it) won't come back for a while. Most likely he won't come back in that session, at the very least will come back sometime in the next session.  More often than not, the GM will drop a clue or two that that character is alive before he "appears" again.<br/>In other words, don't say "Yeah, the Merchant dies", then have them go back to town where the Merchant shows up 3 minutes later with a single scar and a bazooka.<br/><br/>2) And likewise, the players shouldn't say "OK, the merchant is dead, yay! Now I stick my sword in him 100 times and cut off his head to make sure he never comes back". It's just rude, and it makes the GM go to desperate measures if he wants that NPC back ("It's his twin brother" "He's covered in bandages" "He made a pact with the God of Time to return to this world" "You actually killed a confused peasant") etc.  The players should never set themselves up so that the Players (not the PCs) are genuinely surprised or anguished if the NPC comes back in the same or different form.<br/><br/>In the end, <b>the most important thing about Bringing Down the Pain is that only the players can request it, not the GM</b>. The GM can ASK for the players to engage in BDTP, or hint that the NPC will "be back later". But he can't force them to do it. I think that coercing the players with "You can't 'get past' this NPC (to get on with the rest of the scenario) unless you Bring Down the Pain" is a form of the GM forcing BDTP. And antithetical to the rules.
