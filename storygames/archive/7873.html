When I do, one of the features of the IRC program I use, the ability to have multiple channels of chat open at once, and flick between them, becomes an important part of the structure of my mode of play.<br/><br/>What we usually have over on the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a> channel (Magicstar.net, come and see us) is an out of character channel, and an in character or "narration" channel. This has several advantages.<br/><br/>* It keeps the fictional statements about the game, and the dialogue and narration and such like, separated from the social chatter (e.g. "hi how are you guys?" and the rules crunchiness (e.g "so I get a +3 because of my Angst") and audience style comments (e.g. "that was awesome")<br/>* One can opt not to read one channel or the other at different times - most commonly, one can stay with the narration channel if one doesn't wish to be distracted by the OOC chatter.<br/>* One can easily flick between, without missing anything form either channel (as it's all held in a buffer, waiting for you to read it).<br/>* The narration channel log can usually be read afterwards like a story, often without the need for any laborious editing. These pristine artefacts of play are one of the greatest treasures of this method.<br/><br/>Anyway, so multichannel text-based play over the internets is great.<br/><br/>What I'm wondering is, can any of its advantages above be replicated in meatspace (that is, in the real world, in face-to-face roleplaying)?<br/><br/>I can see the idea of having separate ritual spaces for different types of chatter (I think many LAPRs take this approach), but of course this doesn't preserve the buffering feature, where I can click to find out what's been said in the OOC space in the last ten minutes even though I was in the IC space at the time.<br/><br/>Any other ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
