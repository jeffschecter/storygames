                    I have recently heard and read some discussions about character death. It seems like the general agreement is that character death is hard, but it is necessary, for the game to keep its edge.<br/><br/>And that got me thinking, because, even though I have been a GM in various games for over 10 years, I have never killed a character. And have my games lost edge because of that? No, I do not feel so. Actually I believe that when a game don't focus on whatever the character live or die, more focus can be put on conflicts that are much more exiting.<br/><br/>(I have to mention here that many of the games I run is traditional fantasy games, where you will expect the characters to die from time to time. Of course, if you play games like Braking the Ice<sup>1</sup>, this discussion is rather irrelevant.)<br/><br/>If you think about it, the question if the character live or die, is really not that interesting, because you can not build on top of: "Ya, he survived," or "oh no, he died". It does not really advance the drama in any way.<br/><br/>What I do, is that I first get the characters to care about something, or believe in something, to a degree that they see this 'something' to be more important than there own life. And then, instead of putting the characters' life in jeopardy, I put what they believe in in jeopardy. <br/><br/>It is much more interesting when the characters fight to protect other people than them self. And if they fail, killing the character can sometimes be the merciful thing to do: Would you rather die, or face the people you have let down? And of course, a GM is so evil that he don't want the character to take the easy route and just die. <br/><br/>I see the most interesting games to be where the characters life or death are not important anymore. So, unless the character really want to go on a suicide mission, he should not die.<br/>----<br/><sup>1</sup> I have not played Braking the Ice, but from the description I would guess that character death is not a big part of the game.<br/><br/> - Anders                </div>

                            It's not so much character death is necessary to keep an edge- it's that some form of interesting events have to occur- for most cases, that involves some kind of risk or conflict, which doesn't necessarily entail death as the primary issue.  <br/><br/>For example, Polaris prevents character death until the latter part of the game, AND, it can only be called in by the player themselves, yet it regularly produces really engaging play.  Trollbabe doesn't have death mechanics at all, etc.<br/><br/>Death just happens to be the most supported "risk" in play as a carryover from wargame days that few games have realized isn't fundamental to their actual design goals.                        </div>

                            Somewhere on his website, Vince Baker talks about how death in fiction is there to serve a purpose: to establish danger, or to prove a point (that some ideal was worth dying for).  Possibly something else that I've forgotten since I can't find the post now.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that death is necessary, just easy.  It is easy to make the stake of any conflict "Do you survive this encounter?"  It's easy because life or death situations have an inherent draw to them.  But it also can be lazy: is the survival of a fictional character all that is at stake?  Setting the stakes in other areas, and having death be a way of making a statement, can make for a much more interesting game: Achilles has a choice between dying a hero or living as a coward, and chooses to die.  That is more interesting, and you can get even more interesting than that.    <br/>
<br/>
(I'm now imagining the entire Trojan war as a series of Raises in DitV: the death of Patroclus is Achilles' raise to motivate himself to battle.)                        </div>

                            Players start out caring about their own characters, not others. So when you threaten their characters, it creates tension.<br/>
<br/>
The trick is not to keep player character on the table. The trick is to make the players care about other characters, and then threaten them.<br/>

At least that's how I like to play.                        </div>

                            I guess the point really is, how do you make the characters to care about something. Because most players will naturally make characters that only care about them self, and then the most dramatic thing you can do as a GM is threaten their life.<br/><br/>In some games it is part of the premise that you have to care about something. I guess Polaris is such a game (from what I heard about it).<br/><br/>But even when you play a traditional fantasy rpgs, you can set it up so the player most likely will make characters that care about something. You just have to tell what you want with the game, before the player makes their character. ex: "The characters come from a peace loving country, and are send on a secret mission in the war hungry neighbour country, to help a rebel group overthrow the government." This is the way I normally do it.<br/><br/>Another way is to force the players to make characters that care. But in my experience, doing things like this, rarely works very well.<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>

I have not read Riddle of Steel yet, but if you are taking about a belief systems like the one in Burning Wheel or keys in TSoY, it will not necessary make the character care about something other that them self. Take of example "Key of Bloodlust" or "Key of the Masochist".<br/><br/>But these kind of systems can help a lot.<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>

                            The problem of "caring" is something you can't -force- anyone into doing.  But this doesn't mean that it's just about luck or random hope- there's a definite structure to the situation.<br/><br/>Most roleplayers learn not to invest very deeply in places where they receive little or no input, and/or have what they do care about taken out of their control.  A classic example is the player who spends the points for his character to own a bar, and has the bar blown up or burned down within 3 sessions- eventually you learn to stop trying to make these aspects of the character that get taken away by force, and stick only to survival stuff, since that seems to be always well supported.<br/><br/>For players who are used to this kind of play to see that another kind of play is possible, it's usually best to play games that are pretty heavy-handed with player empowerment, such as Inspectres, Dust Devils, Universalis, etc. because there is no room for the GM to stomp on the player's input.  Once you have guaranteed input, and can feel safe about making stuff you can care about without it always being torn away or used as plot hooks for something else, you tend to get play based on something other than survival and simplest conflict.<br/><br/>It also helps train out any GM force behaviors that also scare players from investing emotion into play as well.                        </div>

                            Character death in roleplaying is like character death in fiction. Sometimes it's essential.<br/>
<br/>
If you're playing the kind of game where it's not essential - like reading the kind of novel where it's not essential - then cool, carry on.<br/>
<br/>
If you're playing the kind of game where it is essential, though, you deserve to be playing a game that handles it well. If you're designing the kind of game where it's essential, you'd better figure out how to make it work.<br/>

                            So the trick is to give the player some input into when his character's death occurs and to make sure that any character death happens for important, meaningful reasons.<br/>

By the former, I do not mean that the player gets to veto his own death. Other threads have discussed how a player can make choices that indirectly bring about his death. My personal preference is that death is a procedural thing, not based on the whim of another player or GM. You make some choices, and game procedure kills your character as a result. <br/>
<br/>
Dogs rewards you with more dice when you use violence but you risk death as a result. The fallout is a direct consequence of this risk. Death is a direct (but not assured) consequence of fallout.<br/>
<br/>
In D&amp;D, just about anything can kill you. Just showing up for the game could get your character into a life-or-death situation. "DM: Okay, so you're entering the dungeon. Make a Spot check. Okay, you don't see the 50-foot deep pit. You take 5d6 damage. You only have 12 hit points? Sorry, dude. You're dead." You haven't made any meaningful choices and everything was at the whim of the GM (who presumably designed or purchased this dungeon).  Worse, that situation isn't even a fun Gamist Challenge; it's not like it's good play in the preferred mode for the game.                        </div>

                            Right.  I personally think that when the players put the characters' lives on the line, that is the ultimate high risk-high reward scenario.<br/>

                            In some games, it's essential that <i>playing the game</i> is putting your character's life on the line.<br/><br/>I talk a lot about a notional Band of Brothers roleplaying game. In that game, I shouldn't have to stake my character's life - above and beyond "I go into battle with my unit" - for my character to die.<br/><br/>You know reflection fallout in Dogs, where everybody gets their experience points when they finish a town? I want a game where everybody gets their experience points when a PC bites it.                        </div>

                            There was a short-lived online WWII tactics game where you got a squad of four guys, who could earn promotions for risking their lives and stuff. The neat thing was, "you" was randomly assigned to one of these guys, and not revealed until the mission was over. If the other guys got waxed, no penalty in the long run to you. If your "high-level" officer was that guy who taken down by a surprise sniper, too bad, make a new private. It was a neat system for encouraging you to take some risks... but not too many risks.<br/><br/>This also reminds of HeroQuest's extended conflicts, where do don't figure out who "actually" got hurt until the whole thing is over.<br/><br/>So one idea, for games that want to focus on combats, is have a successful injury take someone "out," and then everyone waits until the commotion is over before they check out how their comrade is doing, and you roll up the "damage" right there, thus creating some suspense.                        </div>
