I'm half-asleep as it is.<br/><br/>So it's been a busy month for me, and I haven't had the time, energy or inclination to really participate on the Internets. But, one of the things I was working on was an extension of an idea mentioned in <a href="http://www.io.com/~sjohn/plots.htm" rel="nofollow">the Big List of RPG Plots</a>, by S. J. Ross. Specifically this bit:\n<blockquote><cite>Somewhere in <a href="http://www.io.com/~sjohn/plots.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, S. John Ross says:</cite><strong>Throw yourself a curve.</strong> Your players will, anyway, so practice early. Pick two random entries from the Big List and make your adventure on those, no matter what comes up - the first one is the hook layer; the second is the meat of the adventure. If the same entry comes up both times, go with it! Two layers can have a similar structure but very different roots or details.</blockquote>\nSo, I initially drew up (or really, scribbled) a random results table and figured out a way to do it with a couple of dice, and then I remembered: <a href="http://www.random-generator.com" rel="nofollow">Abulafia</a>!<br/><br/>I even noticed <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Jacob%27s_Instant_Plot_Generator" rel="nofollow">Jacob's Instant Plot Generator</a>, and I realized that maybe, just maybe, I could combine the both. Maybe even add a list of random twists. That sort of thing. It would be cool.<br/><br/>Except that Abulafia has a couple of limitations. It's really cool, but I hit a brick wall pretty early in the Abulafia implementation: Abulafia doesn't really recurse well. It does one pass to translate the randomizer tags into proper wikitext, and then that's it, so it kind of killed of a couple of ideas right there and then.<br/><br/>But then I remembered something from my earlier, troglodyte-in-London days: NBOS Software's <a href="http://www.nbos.com/products/ipad/ipad.htm" rel="nofollow">Inspiration Pad Pro</a>. I remember being kind of disappointed with it back then, but maybe the software matured a little after the last time I saw it.<br/><br/>It did. I've tinkered with it, and it's pretty damn powerful -- way more powerful than Abulafia is, frankly speaking. There are, though, a couple of problems:\n<ol><li>The final end result is this text file that has to be read by software you need to download, which isn't, as far as I can see, free, open-source software.</li><li>Well, I don't have anywhere to host it, which is a pain. At least with Abulafia the end results can be easily shown to other people around the world.</li></ol>\nThere's supposed to be some kind of <a href="http://www.rpginspiration.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">web implementation of IPP</a>, but I'm kind of suspicious of it. I mean, it's supposed to be just proof-of-concept, and I have no idea if the stuff you upload to it belongs to you or them, that sort of thing. Besides, the code I'm working on belongs to their <a href="http://www.nbos.com/nox/index.php?action=1001&amp;id=77" rel="nofollow">beta version</a>, which requires you to install the version 1.0 and then copy the executables, so that's a bit of a barrier to entry.<br/><br/>Anyway. Any suggestions where I can upload this file? It's hardly very big: it's about 30 KB or so. Would anyone be interested in seeing it? I can email it to interested parties and the like.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102506/#Comment_102506" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T13:12:34+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  1:12PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: T-Boy</cite>Except that Abulafia has a couple of limitations.

Can you elaborate?  Tables (even other tables on other pages) can be called recursively in Abulafia, so I'm a little confused about the limits you're describing. <br/><br/>Another powerful program for this sort of thing is <a href="http://www.mythosa.net/Utils.html" rel="nofollow">Tablesmith</a>, by Bruce Gulke. It's also a downloadable program rather than web-based, but it has a dedicated Yahoo! group where tables and solutions are stored and uploaded for use by the community. I don't know if IPP has something similar - I'm not familiar with that product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103358/#Comment_103358" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T20:45:12+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  8:45PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>I'll be the first to admit Abu has its limitations, but I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. Can you elaborate?</blockquote>\nMan, I'll try. It's been a while since I was working on Abu, and it'll take some time for me to remember what the problem was.<br/><br/>Okay, one of the things I wanted to do in Abu was to generate a double-layered plot, in which each layer would have a random number of twists, specific to that layer itself. I also wanted to get a random number of general plot twists from <a href="http://random-generator.com/index.php?title=General_Plot_Twists" rel="nofollow">a table</a> I had made earlier, so I thought that I could use the following:<br/><br/><code>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;sgdisplay iterations="6"&gt;[main]&lt;/sgdisplay&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br/>&lt;sgtable&gt;<br/><br/>;main<br/>1,&lt;sgdisplay iterations="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;[twists]&lt;/sgdisplay&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br/>1,&lt;sgdisplay iterations="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;[twists]&lt;/sgdisplay&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br/>1,&lt;sgdisplay iterations="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;[twists]&lt;/sgdisplay&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br/><br/>;twists<br/>//-- List of twists....<br/>&lt;/sgtable&gt;<br/></code><br/>That doesn't work. You get, instead, something like the following result, except possibly even more messed up because it's entwined in the &lt;ol&gt; and list tags:<br/><br/><code>&lt;sgdisplay iterations="(random number between 2 and 4)"&gt;&lt;li&gt;[twists]&lt;/sgdisplay&gt;</code><br/>Basically I suspect that the generator only runs through page once. Which is understandable, since you've made mention on how bloody processor-intensive the damned thing was.<br/><br/>Hope I got that right, at any rate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103361/#Comment_103361" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T21:16:33+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  9:16PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So anyway, I've finally uploaded the IPT file to <a href="http://www.scribd.com/" rel="nofollow">scribd</a>, which you can view <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/401421?secret_password=dilk3m5o2h4bb" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <br/><br/>In order to use the table, you'll need to have the following installed:\n<ol><li>Inspiration Pad Pro v1.0, which you can get from <a href="http://www.nbos.com/products/ipad/ipad.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (sadly, I've only tried it on Windows\u2009\u2014\u2009am not sure how well it works on other platforms).</li><li>The Inspiration Pad BETA 2 executables, which you'll need to download from <a href="http://www.nbos.com/nox/index.php?action=1001&amp;id=77" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You'll need to install IPP v1.0 first, and then overwrite the InspirationPad.exe executable with the Inspiration Pad BETA 2 executable. Yeah, it's a bit fiddly, that.</li></ol>\nOnce you do that, download the table source file as raw text, and change the extension from *.txt to *.ipt. Save the file into the \\Tables folder in the IPP installation. Once you do that, you can load up the table and generate your own randomized plots, like so:<br/><br/><a href="http://imageshack.us" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us" src="http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/4508/plotgen001sf1.png" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://imageshack.us" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us" src="http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/315/plotgen002mf1.png" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://imageshack.us" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us" src="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/9111/plotgen003it6.png" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://imageshack.us" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us" src="http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/8461/plotgen004vl6.png" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/><br/>Hope someone finds this useful, at any rate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103399/#Comment_103399" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T06:04:32+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  6:04AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah.
