I've run them before using Last Unicorn Games' rules and found the system kinda flimsy.  It got me thinking about an idea I've had for a while now- converting 4th edition Dungeons and Dragons into a game that's not just about combat, but also about solving problems.  It still wouldn't be as thought provoking as some games, but it might serve as a dramatically tense puzzle and fight game, with at least the character depth we see on Star Trek.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's the idea- throw out the base attack and defense system and combine the combat and skill systems.  This would mean adding skills for weapon and unarmed combat.  Essentially problem solving would become combat- problems are monsters with hit points.  The class system might be replaced with more of a skill power system.  Powers would have specific types of targets they could affect, based on the types of problems they can solve (including physical threats).  So, there's a "monster" type for social engagement, technical/scientific issues, vehicular threats, violent threats in person, etc.  Skill powers would be (skill + roll) vs (skill + 10) for attacks, rather than attribute vs defense. The normal D&amp;D focus on tactical positioning would probably be thrown out for a more narrative form of combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game would get interesting by combining threats.  A simple example might be a bridge crew attempting ship to ship diplomacy while a spacial anomaly disrupts communications.  Players attempting to make "attacks" against the diplomatic situation are at a huge penalty while the disruption goes on, so more technical crew members would be making attacks against that problem with their technical skill powers.  The GM would need to be creative with interlocking sets of problems, but I think the Star Trek setting is perfect for this, since science, technology and other scifi elements are always getting in the middle of normal roleplaying fair, such as violence and diplomacy.  The trick would be making sure the same combinations of problems-as-monsters don't play out over and over again.  I think if the system were used sparingly, with long stretches of RP in between "combat" things would keep from becoming predictable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is too much work and I'm using the wrong system for what I want to do, but the more narrativistic games don't seem to provide a solution for making complex sets of problems interact in a way that's suspenseful and requires thoughtful tactics.  Or am I wrong?  Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323552/#Comment_323552" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T09:08:02+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  9:08AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2011 9:10AM by jdfristrom.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts: <br/><br/>The D&amp;D 4e skill system is just a hair away from parlour narration - though I'm more sensitive to parlour narration than most; there are a lot of popular rpg's that feel like parlour narration to me.<br/><br/>Me, if I was doing Star Trek, I'd grab this and run with it:  <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?board=15.0" rel="nofollow">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?board=15.0</a> Complex sets of problems interacting with suspense and tactics - rely on<a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2008/03/08/fictional-positioning-101/" rel="nofollow">fictional positioning</a> for that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ryanchaddock" title="ryanchaddock"><img alt="ryanchaddock" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ryanchaddock">ryanchaddock</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323575/#Comment_323575" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T10:49:33+00:00" title="May  9, 2011 10:49AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me all of D&amp;D is pretty much parlour narration, including the combat system, but I've had fun with that sort of RP before.  Sometimes you need it, such as when players know vastly less about a subject than their characters.  It just helps move things along.  It's not deep, though.  The style seems somewhat appropriate for handling the jargon infused Trek universe, with its pestering cannon.  If out of me and my player at least one of us doesn't understand how the deflector dish works, we can always rely on the systems to help tell us what the character knows and how well it interacts with that situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nFictional positioning is a vague concept for me to parse.  No offense intended, I don't see how it's not included in any and all systems.

Your torpedo bays don't work and your warp drives are out, so you're kind of a sitting duck."<br/>Players could just as easily say: "Take evasive action", "Feign being disabled and return fire when they're close enough", "Fly away", "Fly into the nearby nebula" - they'll choose options that fit their skills rather than the situation at hand, and succeeding a roll will get them +1 progress no matter what the GM narrates.<br/>Something I've seen happen sometimes with 'advance along a track' mechanics (though not 4e): one player does his thing, another player does their thing, and they don't jibe. One player builds a bomb, another tries a diplomatic route, finally they try stealth, and they all make their rolls so they win the challenge, even though they didn't commit to a single course of action.<br/><br/>But with Vanguard or another AW hack:<br/>GM: "Ok, Khan's ship is approaching, firing photon torpedos. Your torpedo bays don't work and your warp drives are out, so you're kind of a sitting duck."<br/>Science Officer: "Analyze the situation" (hits on a 7-9)<br/>GM: "What do you want to know?"<br/>Science Officer: "Um, what's our best escape route?"<br/>GM: "There's a nearby nebula - your medium-range scanners won't work in there, but neither will Khan's, so his torpedoes will be useless."<br/>(The GM could also have said "Into an asteroid field" or "Into the neutral zone" or a few other options - and the fictional ramifications could well matter - the asteroid field would be trading harm for harm with Khan's smaller ship, the neutral zone might draw the attention of romulans ... )<br/>Captain: "Make it so."<br/>Pilot: "Yeah, I fly us there, top speed."<br/>GM: "Roll coolness under fire."<br/>Pilot hits on a 7-9.<br/>GM decides to offer a choice: "Ok, you can overdrive your engines but you'll blow them out and be stalled in the nebula, or your ship can take some harm from Khan's torpedoes."<br/>Captain: "Keep us flying." <br/>GM: "Pilot's choice."<br/>Pilot: "What the captain said."<br/>GM: "Okay, roll harm for the ship, pilot."<br/>Pilot blows it.<br/>GM: "Your ship is at 9 o'clock, but you and Khan are in the neutral zone now..."<br/>Science Officer: "Has the situation sufficiently changed for me to read the situation again?"<br/>GM: "Hmm...I'm not sure..."<br/>Captain: "I'll try to read Khan." (Hits on a 7-9)<br/>GM: "What's your question."<br/>Captain: "How could I get you to make your ship vulnerable?"<br/>GM: "Ooh, nice question. He's old school, so he's thinking two-dimensionally. You could lead him on, then fly above or below the plane of engagement and come back around..."<br/>Captain: "Make it so."<br/>GM: "Coolness under fire. The fire is they see you coming."<br/><br/>I could play that all day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
