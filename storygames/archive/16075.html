A lot of story games are really paper heavy: you need to keep marking things off, or checking what kind of scene you can play, or moving tokens around, or playing cards, or even have little scraps of paper defining everyone's relationships with each other.<br/><br/>I didn't think much about it when I was mostly playing these kinds of games at cons, which are always around a table; but my long term group is taking a break between campaigns (*) by playing things like Monster of the Week and Fiasco, and I've noticed that it really changes the vibe of the game from people lounging on couches and armchairs and keeping the game mostly in our heads, to <i>needing </i>to have your character sheet and a pencil with you, or <i>needing </i>to be sitting around a table (in our case, small and crowded).  It's interesting. <br/><br/>* (The system we're mostly using for campaigns is a very stripped down version of Fate: characters start life mostly as a name and a few key aspects, and dice rolls generally work out as high, so-so or bad.  Fate points... we have an interesting attitude to fate points.  We both think that they're <i>really important</i>, but also don't bother tracking them.  So our GM would try to bribe us into behaviour that would get us into trouble, or we'd influence a roll, but only when we really cared about it.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366379/#Comment_366379" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T23:28:39+00:00" title="March  9, 2012 11:28PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Stephanie,<br/><br/>That's interesting. I use a ton of paper in my Apocalypse World and Dungeon World campaigns. I like having everything the players and I need to play right there on them instead of having to look through a rulebook all the time, but sometimes I end up having to just look through my big sheaf anyway.<br/><br/>By the way, can you say more about your Fate variant? How can fate points be important if you're not tracking them? Do you mean that you just try to remember them in your mind without writing them down or counting chips or something? in other words, tracking them with thoughts rather than paper or other physical things?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366402/#Comment_366402" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T08:41:27+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  8:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Story games do seem to be extremely paper-oriented, what with all the relationship maps and so forth.

And fate points ended up more as a... signifier, I guess?  If I'm willing to spend a fate point on a roll, then it's because it's very important to me, but I'm not writing down how many fate points I've got, because I can't be bothered with the paperwork, and I trust the GM and the rest of the group not to take the piss about it.  And when fate points come in at all, it's mostly because someone wants to reinvoke an aspect, rather than bumping up a dice roll directly.  I think we kind of drifted into it, rather than having a conscious discussion of rules, although it means when we're looking for replacement players we need to be a bit careful about how their personality will fit in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366443/#Comment_366443" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T15:03:20+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  3:03PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is true of a lot of games!<br/><br/>However, I think it's mostly an attempt to make them more user-friendly, not less so.<br/><br/>Still, this is a very valuable comment.
