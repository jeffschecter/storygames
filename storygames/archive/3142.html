The convention is mostly a sci-fi one but it always has RPGs (RPGA, Warhammer, and some random stuff) and a LARP running at it.<br/>\nThe first was Introduction to RPGs (15 minutes long) that was to introduce people to what RPGs were.<br/>\nThe second was 0 to RPGer in 15 Minutes where I was to run a 15 minute RPG session for a couple people at a time. This lasted 30 minutes.<br/>\nI ran them on the first and second day making sure to avoid big events and offered a ticket party with the guests as a prize to anyone that had shown up at the first Intro to RPGs. No one showed up but a few people people that already played RPGs to see what it was about then leave. The only good thing that came of this was to attract players for a really rocking game of Polaris later on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third one was an RPG Theory discussion panels where a number of people showed up. It was up to nearly a dozen people by the end. This was cool and a real neat discussion. It was all traditional players but me and Glendower from The Forge. The Theory panel felt like most of the participants just wanted to swap gaming stories and I had to keep it on track covering actual theory. It would start with something that related to a technique I had just mentioned like bangs or kickers and expand form there with competing gamer stories. It was a good discussion though and I think/hope people got some good use out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nProgram book entries for my panels.<br/>\nIntroduction to Roleplaying (15 minutes)<br/>\nWhat are RPGs (Pen and paper ones) are, how to play them, and some examples of RPGs. Meant for people who have not played before. This will cover basic terminology, techniques, and why its fun to play RPGs. This aims to answer the questions of just what is roleplaying, do I have to be able to act, and what is a character. Also where you can get RPGs in Winnipeg and the Internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom 0 to Roleplayer in 15 Minutes (30 minutes)<br/>\nIt has been said that you can't explain an RPG to someone that hasn't played one before. So here is where you can really figure out what an RPG is by playing one. It will be a 10-15 minute game session for a few people at a time. There will be a choice of sci-fi and fantasy scenarios for the players to pick from.<br/>\n<br/>\nRPG Theory (1 hour)<br/>\nA sort of follow up to Introduction to RPGs but aimed at the more experienced player or those that just want to learn more. This will cover the "models" of GNS/Big Model and the Three Fold as an introduction to RPG styles. Then it will cover more advanced techniques such as setting stakes, kickers/bangs, and conflict VS task resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.keycon.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=211" rel="nofollow">Theory handout link.</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71742/#Comment_71742" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T18:47:19+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  6:47PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff.<br><br>Can you say a little more about how you planned your theory talk?

I do want to get some more people interested in playing RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nmisuba:<br/>\nThe plan for my theory talk was to cover a subject like GNS then open things up to questions for a bit before moving on to another topic.<br/>\nWhat we mostly ended up with was using talking about things for a most of the time then I would either bring up some relevant theory or when the stories got too far off the topic I would introduce a new technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example<br/>\nMe: A kicker is ... and this is an example of it.<br/>\nPerson 1: yeah I did (Kicker involving an elf) in my game.<br/>\nOthers: Kicker discussion or elf stories.<br/>\nMe: (Get everyones attention) that story sounds more like a bang that works like this ...<br/>\nOR<br/>\nWhat do you think of this related (To what you just said) technique...<br/>\n<br/>\nThose that were interested in talking about how things work kept on topic the most while the more casual players (that is the impression I got off them) went off into stories the most. I recommend doing something like this myself if you are interested in doing it. I tried for a lot of back and forth because I don't think I can fill that much time on my own (it was 2 hours plus 1 hour overtime) or that they would be too interested if they didn't get their stories in.<br/>\nDoes that help you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71753/#Comment_71753" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T21:05:37+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  9:05PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would suggest a bookstore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71756/#Comment_71756" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T22:34:00+00:00" title="May 24, 2007 10:34PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to respond by saying that part of the RPGA's mission was education about role-playing, but according to the RPGA's site, it's not.  The current version of the RPGA is a support organization for D&amp;D and d20 games, providing play opportunities for those games.  So it's not designed to grow the hobby, just sustain it.<br><br>Jason's comments about the sci-fi convention mirror my own experiences at the local area con and our monthly game days.  The RPGAers stick to their local meets, not attending anything that's not an RPGA event.  That is, while at the local area sci-fi con with an attached gaming space, the RPGAers showed up for the RPGA game sessions and didn't attend the SF offerings.  (For the most part, they didn't even look at the non-d20 games offered at the con.)  It also didn't appear that people who went to the con for the SF offerings were interested in the gaming.  (This may have been because the gaming offerings at the local con weren't mentioned in the convention guidebook.)  What I think Jason is saying here is at SF cons with gaming rooms attached, you probably won't get any crossover between SF and gaming interests.<br><br>Also, the majority of cons I've looked at have had the majority of events be RPGA events.  If someone knows very little about role-playing, they'll probably recognize D&amp;D and see that's what the RPGA does.  To non-gamers, what the RPGA does is what role-playing games are.  RPGs are games with miniatures on a table where you roll funny dice to see if you hit/kill the other miniatures.<br><br>If any or all of the above doesn't make any sense, please blame my cold medication.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71827/#Comment_71827" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T10:29:10+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 10:29AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The above really matches matches what I have seen at the conventions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71849/#Comment_71849" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T11:40:51+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 11:40AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I think you could do at a science fiction convention is get onto panels as the "gaming representative" for whatever topic is being done.<br><br>i.e. if the topic is Mars exploration, you could talk about Adamant's Mars d20 supplement, GURPS Mars, etc. and pass out a flyer for a Mars game to be played at 10 PM in the gaming room or whatever.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71868/#Comment_71868" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T12:55:44+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 12:55PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was considering doing something like this at one of the gaming cons where the RPGA presence is the same size as, or smaller than, the presence of other roleplaying.

I like the real name over the internet handle.<br>\n<br>\nTJ's games were great.  Polaris was a rollicking good time, and almost all of us died tragically!  Dogs was also good, but really needed to be cut into two different groups.  Six people playing just doesn't work for that system.  <br>\n<br>\nThe RPG Panel had a surprising amount of people, compared to many of the other panels I attended.  I think that by rough count you had 12 - 15 people attended, which was a welcome sight.  <br>\n<br>\nI had an agenda when I attended the RPG Theory Panel. I was looking for people to connect with and arrange future discussions with, those who had similar interests in things like collaborative gaming and shared authority.  I threw out a few ideas to the group and spoke afterwards to those that were nodding and grooving to what I was saying.  I wish I had some kind of recording of the session to get a feel for what parts went right and generated useful discussion, and what parts fell kind of flat.  <br>\n<br>\nI do remember a comment I made regarding GM burnout, which was "the GM's greatest resource for ideas and stories is his players", and it generating some thoughtful and excited comments.  When one player commented about how he didn't like to give the GM ideas, because he was afraid they'd be used against him, we went into the concept of trusting one another at the table. I talked about social contract, and what promises can be made to empower/reward players for ideas, rather than punishing them.  TJ then added in some social contract techniques like Lines and Veils to keep us focused. <br>\n<br>\nI did manage to get an email or two, which for me is mission accomplished.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71906/#Comment_71906" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T14:58:11+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  2:58PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!
