This game is crazy. You literally roll 3d6 for each stat <i>in order</i>, no re-rolls, no shuffling. John's first character (of three) had a 3 intelligence, which the rules tell us means he "has trouble speaking". <br/><br/>So everyone rolled up characters and marched off to the dungeon where a band of Kobolds slaughtered them in their first combat. Everyone actually seemed OK, with this, as we'd determined the game is nasty deadly. Everyone rolled up new characters and kept right on going. I'm considering making a fantasy game that uses character churn to drive collaborative world-building, but that's another story.<br/><br/>In the end, a group of characters did emerge from the ziggurat with a bit of magical treasure, a fortune in jewlery, and a map to even greater exploits.<br/><br/>Basic is a blast, and the rules tell you exactly how to run it. When the party meets a monster, for example, they have the option to run, fight, talk, or wait. The whole party does the same thing, and these are the only things you can do. As long as you play in this sprit, it seems to run pretty well. As soon as the players start wanting to get the best of both worlds (and they will, because everything can kill them), it can start to fall apart. <br/><br/>This game rewards embracing the rules and running with them. It's really almost a board game with a role-playing element. The rules are so deadly that the players will naturally want to turn to the role-playing aspect to save their measly lives. This has the potential to break the game down. There aren't really any procedures beyond GM authority to resolve the resulting situations. Yes, I know this is all old news to many of you, but now that I've actually seen it in play, I feel I can talk about it.<br/><br/>As an experiment, I combined the Basic D&amp;D game with a solo dungeon-construction game I've been working on called <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/Dungeon.aspx" rel="nofollow">How to Host a Dungeon</a>. How to Host a Dungeon essentially gave me a dungeon campaign map that I could call upon to add some context to the players' adventures. I drew up a hex map of a human kingdom showing all the possible entrances to the dungeon and handed it to the players. Once they decided which entrance to use, I made up the adventure on the fly using a combination of ideas I jotted down and the Basic rules dungeon generation system. It worked so well that I'm not going to add a section to How to Host a Dungeon about using it to create maps for dungeon crawl games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115520/#Comment_115520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T07:18:48+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  7:18AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You <b>can</b> do some shuffling of stats, or at least combined raising and lowering.

I started my own roleplaying life with the Holmes edition of Basic D&amp;D (the one prior to Moldvay) that then drifted to AD&amp;D when we got the Player's Handbook.  So I missed out on this particular branch of the D&amp;D tree.  There was definitely some familiarity, but the Moldvay edition is clearly much more structured than what we played.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs players, we (or at least I) were initially a bit taken aback by the starting TPK, but we bounced back pretty quickly.  By the end, I had gotten into the "clear a few rooms, loot, exit, restock, repeat" groove.  Two of the second batch of characters survived to the end, and two players were on their thirds.  I wound up with a whopping 650 XP.  Almost a 1/3 of the way to second level! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was nice to have the perspective to see the game for what it was, and not what I wanted it to be.  My second character was a Lawful Cleric (Abelard of the Holy Sepulchre), and at the very end of the game when we were looting the tomb of an ancient dwarven king, I had a brief moment of "my character would be offended by this", and then I was all like "yeah, but this is the only way the game rewards you", and gleefully helped tot up the treasure and XP.  Deep character motivation can be fun, just not in *this* game.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony's observation on the multiple characters per player is also insightful.  My initial D&amp;D play was in this mold.  At the time, it was simply born of necessity, since we typically played with a GM and one to two players, and the modules were clearly set up for 8+ adventurers.  I'd always assumed that people that *didn't* live in out of the way hellholes where more than three people played D&amp;D, *of course* did one player, one character, but now I'm beginning to suspect not!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was also nice to compare the feel of retro-D&amp;D with my own retro-game of choice, T&amp;T.  It's pretty clear after this outing that while they may appear similar on the surface, the motivations and outcomes of the two are radically different.  As John mentioned, even though we were joking around during play, there was the undercurrent of the grim grind of death and survival, whereas T&amp;T is more about the lighthearted awesome and skivyness.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot something I'd want to play every week, but it was a refreshing change of pace and perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115612/#Comment_115612" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T11:53:24+00:00" title="December 20, 2007 11:53AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2007 11:54AM by DannyK.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>Ziggurat of the Dwarf Lords?

It was definately something I was willing to appraoch again with my own D&amp;D game.
