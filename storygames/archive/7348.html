I thought the previous version was already very good, but the new one really explains things and walks through the process. I was skeptical of all the examples at first but I think they would be very helpful to new readers.<br/><br/>As far as the rule changes (at least the ones I could pick out): stationary advantage dice, keyword goals, overrun condition, the final confrontation option -- all look excellent. Very groovy.<br/><br/>Not defining advantage dice until there is a conflict in that area is also interesting. I like that it means you don't just grab stuff and carry it around for no reason (a danger in the old version), but I could also see cases where it would make sense: you just escaped the monster, then in a non-combat scene you find a fire axe and grab it to carry to the next scene. Not sure what the solution is there.<br/><br/>"members of a losing side each gain a condition collectively chosen by the involved players" sounds a little like everyone has to take the same condition. Is that intentional? I'm hoping not.<br/><br/>The only rule I'm not sure I like is having a traitor automatically lose against the menace. I would almost go the other way, give a traitor a free pass the _first time_ they betrayed their friends (the classic sealing the door to save yourself instead of waiting for everyone else to get through). Or maybe that just needs to be a Condition: Traitor, can no longer pool dice with anyone else. You take it when you first betray people and automatically fail to the menace (per the rules as written). That ensures the swift approach of karma, which is also appropriate.<br/><br/>Also since the graphical mapping is a really fun and (I'd say) important part of the game, how about including at least one simple map for the examples to drive the point home? Current exchange rate of pictures to words is still around a thousand I think, so it would be a good investment.<br/><br/>All in all, Geiger Counter was already kick-ass, now it's kick-ass-plus.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163188/#Comment_163188" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T06:32:16+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  6:32AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>I could also see cases where it would make sense: you just escaped the monster, then in a non-combat scene you find a fire axe and grab it to carry to the next scene.

I'm glad you think the game's getting better as it keeps being developed further.  Can you talk more about why you were dubious about the examples and what eventually won you over?<br/><br/>The only other change you might have missed is that the characters (like the menace) roll all their dice in every confrontation, which might potentially be controversial, if you've been playing the previous version.  But try it out and see if you think it makes it more elegant and makes characters less likely to be hosed because their players unknowingly chose inappropriate survival or advantage dice.<br/><br/>Additionally, the pooling rules are somewhat new, or at least are much more clear than the original rules for teaming up in confrontations.<br/><br/>Christian's solution to the dice-defining is not a bad one, actually, and something that should probably be in the text.  There's all this stuff in the game that doesn't necessarily have mechanical weight, right?  Most characters still love their momma, even if they don't get advantage dice from it, yeah?  It's really just that you can't define what actually gives you an advantage until right before you use it in a confrontation.  So, yeah, grab an axe, pray for your life, discover the secret passcodes, kiss the frustratingly arrogant intelligence officer you've been bickering with for the entire movie.  But only decide what's actually important <i>once it matters</i>, because if you decide what's important beforehand ("I have an ax!"), you might end up fighting a swarm of mind-controlled alien bees (as happened in the very first Geiger playtest) and your ax might not seem as appropriate anymore.<br/><br/>Honestly, handing traitorous characters properly has been a thorny issue throughout Geiger's development. The "Traitor" condition appeared in early drafts (like, back in the alien bee swarm days, when Geiger only could make Scifi Channel Original Movies) and, after reading your post, I think you may be right that it might work.  I'd just dismissed it after early mediocre play, since EVERYONE wanted to be the traitor and I couldn't, at that point, figure out a way to implement it.  If you have more suggestions in this regard, I'd be excited to hear them (since you were really helpful in making "Overrun" work), though my own wheels are beginning to turn on that issue as well.  It's especially exciting that, with the recent addition of Buyoffs, you could actually redeem yourself from being the traitor...<br/><br/>One thing I didn't have room to include in the beta was what you do when you decide that one of the main characters is actually the menace, as sometimes happens in slasher movies like Scream.  In the beginning, Geiger was an Afraid hack called <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2007/04/10/afraid-teen-slasher-version-17/" rel="nofollow">Craven County</a>, which was explicitly trying to replicate this, but you should still be able to do this in Geiger.<br/><br/>One other point that I didn't make explicit in the best rules is that, compared to many other small press games of the post-Forge school, Geiger Counter is more open to fudging and ad hoc solutions to immediate problems, partially because, since it's a one shot, the most important thing is making the game work <i>right now</i>.  A single tweak for one scene, where you have a confrontation involving the traitor work one way, doesn't necessarily have to establish precedent for future conflicts involving the traitor.  This isn't invoking the Golden Rule, really, but just allowing for flexibility rather than insisting on strictly following the established guidelines even in unusual circumstances.  I probably fudge how conditions are parsed out at least once a game, based on what's happening in a given confrontation.  For example, if one character decides to fight the menace by blowing the hatch on the airlock, then it makes sense that all the characters in that location have to beat their roll or gain a condition, even though characters can't normally attack everyone at once like that.  Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Example maps are definitely coming in the next/final version.  For now, I think the ones linked on the download page, in the play reports that have already been posted, do a pretty great job.  I should probably indicate as much on the website.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163243/#Comment_163243" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T09:38:47+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  9:38AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've read through the document and plan to see if I can drum up interest and facilitate a game on Thursday at a local game shop.<br/><br/>I'm a little fuzzy on condition buyoffs.  Do you just have to hope that a director frames a scene that makes it possible for you to recover your tools or manage to free yourself, for example?  Since there's no conflict resolution aside from characters against the Menace, can you just narrate a situation in which you get your tools back or do you need the director to narrate it or what?<br/><br/>How has this game worked with people w/o experience at GM-less games like Contenders or The Roach, or PTA (scene-framing)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163248/#Comment_163248" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T09:57:31+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  9:57AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthew, yeah, the intention is for one of the other players to frame a scene in which you fulfill the buyoff conditions, though this probably shouldn't just start with them just being like "Okay, you manage to work your way out from underneath the rubble.  You're no longer Trapped."  Instead, it should be more like, "Okay, you're trapped in the rubble and the whole corridor around you is creaking and groaning, like it's about to cave in or maybe the menace is lurking somewhere around here."  And then you describe your character trying to free themselves and the director or other players describe complications, like "Okay, you're down to just this really big rock that's hard to move, but it's directly on your leg."  And maybe your character grabs a metal bar that is lying around, something that used to be part of a support, a tries to pry the rock off their leg... but then the menace attacks!  And, if there's an advantage die in the room, you grab it and declare that it's the metal bar, which you're going to bash the menace in the head with.  And then, after the confrontation, assuming you're still alive, the other players agree that, yeah, you've fulfilled the buyoff conditions and are no longer trapped.  Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Definitely, having some PTA experience helps, but there aren't really enough GMless games out there yet (though more coming all the time) that you can hope that people have that kind of background.  I haven't had any really huge problems.  Most of the issues I've had in play come from people being too into their individual characters or what they're personally narrating and not really jacking into the group experience.  That can be a problem no matter what people's background is, but if you can get folks to invest as a group, I think it should work pretty well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163347/#Comment_163347" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T13:43:50+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  1:43PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jonathan.

If the character survives while restricted they will certainly deserve having their condition removed.  Although they might have a new condition!<br/><br/>I read though the pdf again at lunch.  I found myself wishing I had a highlighter on me to highlight those preparations I'll want to make and those explanations I'll want to make to new group.  I'll do it at home.  Even so, I'm sure I'll find myself flipping though the pages at the table.  A one-page list of bullet points for new facilitators might be a nice addition.<br/><br/>On the "jacking in to the group experience" issue, has any iteration of the game had something like fan mail or gift dice?

It just seemed like a lot of example text at first glance but when I read it it worked. I will admit one thing that distracted me was that "Sky Burial" and "Starlight, Starbright" were thematically very similar titles (sky / star) even though the stories themselves are (rightly) extremely different. Sharp contrast would be better. How does "Killer Commie Blood Wolves" grab you? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>\n<blockquote>The only other change you might have missed is that the characters (like the menace) roll all their dice in every confrontation, which might potentially be controversial, if you've been playing the previous version.</blockquote>\nI think we hardly (if ever) limited people using their starting advantage or survival dice that way for those same reasons.<br/><br/>Does that include advantage dice defined as the game goes on? If so doesn't that butt up against the "you said it's a fire axe but now we know the menace is a ghost so how does that help?" Of course with good description anything can work, so might be a non-issue.\n<blockquote>But only decide what's actually important once it matters, because if you decide what's important beforehand ("I have an ax!"), you might end up fighting a swarm of mind-controlled alien bees (as happened in the very first Geiger playtest) and your ax might not seem as appropriate anymore.</blockquote>\nHow would that work with moving dice? Do you leave them where they were since you can't define them until a conflict occurs? Seems tricky.<br/><br/>a) One alternative would be to just let people grab and define mobile dice outside of conflicts, but be strict about ignoring them in conflicts where they shouldn't help (contradicting the point above).<br/><br/>b) Another alternative is to make a complete break in the advantage dice system: keep the stationary dice as is but put the mobile dice into a sidebar when they are placed instead of a location. Anyone can then grab and define one of those mobile advantage die if they are in a conflict (but only one can be defined per conflict). Too easy? I'm not sure I like it.<br/><br/>c) I could also see cases where stationary dice get remotely defined in roleplaying pre-conflict: there are 3 undefined stationary dice in the lab from when it was first created but there have been no conflicts there. While hiding in the steam tunnels Doc says if they can get to the lab he can brew up a pesticide to kill the plant monsters. He hasn't technically defined those dice, but everyone is kind of agreeing that is what those dice will be. This is basically what happened in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6712" rel="nofollow">The Silent Deep</a>. I think it's a common pattern.<br/><br/>Option C could lead to a more general rule: you can define advantage dice if you are in the same location and in a conflict, or in any location you _aren't_ in even if there is no conflict ("we have to get the chainsaw from the toolshed!"). I kind of like that.<br/>\n<blockquote>I'd just dismissed it after early mediocre play, since EVERYONE wanted to be the traitor and I couldn't, at that point, figure out a way to implement it.</blockquote>\nTraitors rock. We've had lots of luck with traitors, and we never had everyone wanting to be traitors, but I suppose that depends on the type of scenario -- some genres are full of bastards.<br/><br/>The more I think about it the more I'm liking the traitor condition. You could also broaden it to "untrustworthy" with the same mechanics (no pooling).<br/><br/>By the way, redeemed traitor? Awesome. Of course you'd have to convince the other players to go for it which is doubly awesome...<br/> <br/>\n<blockquote>One thing I didn't have room to include in the beta was what you do when you decide that one of the main characters is actually the menace, as sometimes happens in slasher movies like Scream.</blockquote>\nThat's supercool and I think quite easy in the current rules -- the character just "dies" and becomes the NPC menace (not under the original player's control). No special rules needed, but definitely deserves mention in the text.<br/><br/> <br/>\n<blockquote>Does that make sense?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely. It highlights what I really like about Geiger Counter: it hits that sweet spot between rules and trusting the players to work towards the fun. Some other games err too far in either direction, restricting the players too much or leaving them adrift and making them do all the work.<br/> <br/>\n<blockquote>Example maps are definitely coming in the next/final version.</blockquote>\nCool.

Perhaps something like:<br/><br/>1. You don't get the condition by loosing to the menace - you declare it yourself to escape automatically from other main characters at the beginning of a confrontation (against the menace or against other characters). <br/>2. You get an advantage dice (several?) but can't pool dice with other players for the rest of the game.<br/>3. Traitor cannot be declared too early. Perhaps first after the menace is full strength.<br/>4. There can be only one. Once a traitor has been revealed, no other may take the condition.<br/>5. The traitor cannot be the sole survivor. If the last non-traitor dies in a confrontation with the menace, the traitor dies automatically in the next scene.<br/><br/>Excellently written.

Or, well, the version we played at GoPlayNW.  No pre-made moments, no secret goals, no big ole list of characters jointly created and picked from.  Overall it'll probably be smoother this way, but I'm wondering if secondary characters are going to be less featured now that you don't have a list of character names to start with.  We did a lot with our extras in The Protocol, but if we hadn't brainstormed characters beforehand to pick primaries from, we wouldn't have had the same pool to pick secondaries from, complete with names and archetypes.<br/><br/>Well, we'll see.  Plan is to play it tonight at Guardian Games (those of you who are in Portland, show up for Beer&amp;Pizza Game Night!), so I'll report back after that experience <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164291/#Comment_164291" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T19:43:29+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  7:43PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>A one-page list of bullet points for new facilitators might be a nice addition.</blockquote>\nWhat would you want on such a list, Matthew?  I'm definitely interested in anything that makes facilitating the game easier.<br/><br/>There have never been fanmail / giftdice in Geiger for two reasons: 1) I'm not sure that kind of arbitrary advantage for cool actions fits the genre, really, and 2) personally, I find that most groups stop handing out fanmail once it really starts working, because it becomes superfluous; they're saying "awesome" and giving each other high-fives (figuratively or not) all the time, just as the players do in the example scenes in the beta.  I think I'd rather that kind of thing be socially, not mechanically, supported, in this particular case.<br/><br/>Ben, you have a point about the example games having similar titles.  I'm not 100% satisfied with the Starlight, Starbright examples, actually, because I found them not nearly as exciting and grabby as I wanted them to be.  It's possible that I'll end up coming up with completely different examples in the final version, but I want to talk with people more about what works and doesn't work in that regard.<br/><br/>When I run it, you can't pick up undefined dice and you can't define dice until you use them.  So if you walk through a room with undefined dice, don't get attacked, and then walk into a neighboring room, with no dice, and the menace jumps you, you're stuck with the dice you've got.  You can grab a fire ax in the room without dice, sure, but it won't help you mechanically.  You can, however, grab the fire ax, fail or succeed in the first confrontation with the menace, escape to the room with dice and THEN get dice for the ax in the next confrontation.  Is that too counter-intutitive?  It does make "raiding the armory" scenes tough, I guess.  If there's a bunch of dice in the armory, you have to be attacked there to define them as guns, or at least have a dispute amongst the characters there.  But it does allow you to raid the armory for guns, even if there are no dice there, and then get dice for the guns later in locations where there are dice.  Hmm... that still feels a bit weird.<br/><br/>See, everyone wanted to be the traitor in SGBoston games because it's clearly the most fun, I think, even if you die early.  The way the traitor rules originally worked was very similar to Frederick's guidelines, which are great, but maybe could be streamlined?  I'm not quite sure how.  It went something like this:<br/><br/>1. Once all 8 menace dice are defined, choose the traitor.<br/>2. The traitor gains an extra condition, "traitor," which counts as one of their three conditions.<br/>3. The traitor can team-up with the menace in conflicts.<br/>4. If the traitor is the last main character alive, the menace kills them.<br/><br/>Yeah, becoming the menace is pretty simple, mechanically, but sometimes people want to know, like, do they pass on their survival die, as if they were dead?  Does their pawn still move around on the map?  Also, how does scene framing work, because normally the director plays the menace?  Those kinds of details would need to be spelled out.<br/><br/>Christian, one of my goals for this version was getting people playing faster, since a few groups mentioned that they almost cut out the trailer because brainstorming and character creation took so long.  You can definitely still create a bunch of secondary characters if you want (like the provincial inspector in one of the example games), but it's no longer the default.  Let me know, though, if you think it's become too stripped down and needs some of those options recommended more strongly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164317/#Comment_164317" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T00:09:24+00:00" title="August 22, 2008 12:09AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2008 12:11AM by Christian_Griffen.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played it tonight with three "vets" and three newbies to indie games.

It seems to go against the whole Geiger Counter joy, which is to trust the players to play a good game (again, what I like about it). Saying a traitor can do this but can't do that because of mechanics prejudges the story. Can't the bad guy ever win? Does it really make sense to say "no, it's illegal for your character to betray us because Fred already did. Do something else." Let the players decide what their characters do.<br/><br/>Besides if you make all these rules for the traitor stereotype, don't you have to do the same thing for the hero, and then the love interest, etc? That takes the game in a whole different direction.<br/><br/>I think just a traitor/untrustworthy condition is enough.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>No pre-made moments, no secret goals, no big ole list of characters jointly created and picked from.</blockquote>\nNoooooo! I totally missed that minor characters weren't being created (it's always harder to spot an omission than an addition). Having all the secondary characters rocks, because when you see their death coming it means something -- even if they didn't get much screen time you "knew" them already. I admit it takes longer but it's worth it.<br/><br/>I liked writing trailer snippets ahead of time, because once people start reading there are no pauses to think of what to say next. It just flows one to the next. You also don't stop to negotiate or group-think (aka play before the game) because you are going from your mini script.<br/><br/>Goals are still there, they're just keyword based and optionally open or secret.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>You can, however, grab the fire ax, fail or succeed in the first confrontation with the menace, escape to the room with dice and THEN get dice for the ax in the next confrontation.  Is that too counter-intutitive?</blockquote>\nYeah. Saying you're grabbing a gun now, but not having it be a die until you get into a room with a die and a conflict... that's just too meta.<br/><br/>Given that there are only 3 mobile dice, maybe you should just do away with requiring a conflict before you define dice. Sure someone picks up an axe once they expect trouble, that makes sense. The only limit should be the common sense one of not picking up things when there's no reason to do it (no picking up axes when the characters don't even know a menace is stalking them yet).<br/><br/><br/>Unrelated note: it might help to have a simple list of all the steps to start a game at the beginning of the text, so people can see the big picture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164325/#Comment_164325" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T01:53:05+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  1:53AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re the examples, the other thing that turned me off was that the formatting wasn't different from the rules.

The GM might declare you're together, or split up, attacked by the menace -- whatever she wanted.<br/><br/>As far as the conflict stuff goes, think of it this way: Conditions are the plot-clock for a particular character. If you've been on-screen for the exciting bits, you are going to get conditions, which means you are moving towards death. You live longer by sharing the spotlight. Being declared the hero early can be deadly.<br/><br/>But the bigger point is that in Geiger Counter, even more than in lots of other story games it's not about your guy winning, it's about the good story.<br/><br/>I think it's critical that in the first version you didn't necessarily have a 1-to-1 relationship between survivors and players: you had 6-7 survivors, and you split them up as seemed good. But that meant that a particular survivor wasn't really "my guy." We even traded characters around when two characters held by the same player developed connections and clearly needed to interact a lot (better than talking to yourself) or when they just appeared in scenes together a lot.<br/><br/>Having named and stereotyped secondary characters at the beginning means that if a survivor someone was playing does die, you can spontaneously promote an interesting secondary character to survivor and let a player take them over -- you shouldn't automatically do that every time, particularly if it's near the end or none of the secondaries really stand out, but sometimes it works great (witness the plucky but overlooked Bulldog from Silent Deep).<br/><br/>We also assigned secondary characters to players at the beginning too (again ready to swap at the drop of a hat) but I don't think the rules ever suggested that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164981/#Comment_164981" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T12:46:26+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 12:46PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's definitely a reason that there are "main characters" and not "PCs" in Geiger Counter.
