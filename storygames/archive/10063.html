It works just fine here in Finland. Anybody want to multiply their audience by a magnitude, feel free to offer your game to a traditional publisher; just be careful to make sure that the game is wholly a book, and wholly understandable to the publisher's editor.<br/><br/>We've had four rpg books published in this way in Finland through the last decade, I think. Not many sales numbers are available, but my understanding is that there is just one Finnish rpg that <i>might</i> compete with their sales through the traditional hobby distribution. Everybody else is left far behind.<br/><br/>(Part of this is no doubt that Finland is such a small market that any publisher worth the name will be able to sink more books into the book trade in a month than the average indie rpg sells over its life. So it's not so much that rpgs sell well in book trade, but that they sell so little through hobby distribution. Still, rpg books fare no worse than poetry, as a local rpg writer is fond of saying.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223333/#Comment_223333" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T17:09:10+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  5:09PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being in the mainstream book market is a royal headache, as I've heard from many indie comics publishers.<br/><br/>1. First off, you have to print thousands of copies for that even to be viable.<br/>2. Second, if the books don't sell, bookstores can return them to the publishers.<br/><br/>So you're printing thousands of copies... and could just end up sitting on them. Are you ready to be taken seriously?  I'm not.<br/><br/>There is one indie rpg already in mainstream bookstores and it's Mouse Guard. That had nothing to do with packaging or changing what Luke was already doing and everything to do with it being co-published by a comics publisher who was already in Barnes &amp; Noble. People who are prepared to start working on that scale can totally do it, packaging and marketing be damned. Roleplaying games are already in bookstores being taken seriously.  Have you see the display tables of 4E products in Borders? The only way to get real respect in retail is though sales volume, done through distributors that bookstores stock from.<br/><br/>Or are you talking about a different kind of respect?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223343/#Comment_223343" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T19:05:06+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  7:05PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We are maybe talking about a different kind of respect. And a different kind of bookstore. Mainstream bookstores, where quantity is king, may not be the kind of market that is really right for many indie games. In Portland (where I live) there are many, many bookstores that sell books by local publishers, small press publications, zines, mini comics,short run books and all kinds of other stuff. Most of these stores also carry comics of some kind or another (since Portland is a huge comics town) and some games of some kind. I've had some luck selling my own games to these stores. Out of the five stores I presented my games to three were very receptive and ended up carrying the books. Two reordered. Unfortunately I haven't followed up on this, since this came right at the end of my initial publisher enthusiasm, and I've been focusing on the making stuff side of what I do for the last two years instead. but there is a market in small bookstores, as well as comic shops, record stores and a ton of other businesses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223366/#Comment_223366" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T00:07:40+00:00" title="August  8, 2009 12:07AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I think there was a lot more to comics getting taken seriously then just getting into book stores.

The local alternative weekly, The Portland Mercury, recently published an article on a (mostly) all-girl D&amp;D gaming group and heralded it as the new thing in gaming. I'm not denigrating that, but I personally wouldn't say that girls playing D&amp;D is really what's cool about gaming these days. Even such a low-to-the-ground media outlet like the Mercury has no idea what's going on. Not that it's necessarily totally their fault. (p.s. I'd love for some of the PDX game publishers to try to get in contact with the weeklies, and such.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223370/#Comment_223370" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T00:30:55+00:00" title="August  8, 2009 12:30AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Or are you talking about a different kind of respect?</blockquote>\nAnother type of respect that comic books get in the sense of being taken seriously is due to -- ta da -- the money that Hollywood can make off of 'em.  When people saw fucktons of cash literally falling into the pockets of people making movies based on comic books, they started thinking that comic books were worth paying attention to.  These days the New York Times will review a Batman trade paperback seriously, and that's because of movies.<br/><br/>AFAIK comics in and of themselves are still not a place where you can make a lot of money, but as a venue for creating licensed properties they're clearly up near the top of the list.<br/><br/><br/>...but I can't think of any way that this particular brand of respect could possibly be emulated by an RPG; certainly not any <i>useful</i> way.  I'm not sure how you could find a way to spin off something from an RPG into another entertainment industry and turn a profit off it (and judging from that awful D&amp;D movie, apparently Hollywood doesn't know how to do it either).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223377/#Comment_223377" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T03:20:30+00:00" title="August  8, 2009  3:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>Also, I think there was a lot more to comics getting taken seriously then just getting into book stores.

A thousand times this.<br/><br/>The first time <i>I</i> ever started thinking about comics as a serious medium was when I randomly ran across <i>Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer</i> at the public library. It was the first time I'd ever seen a comic that involved something other than a "good" dude in spandex beating up a "bad" dude in spandex, and the first time I ever realized that you could combine the immediacy and visualality of film with the depth and invitation to reflection of prose into something that incorporated the best aspects of both film <i>and</i> prose at the same time. <br/><br/>Of course, none of that has anything to do with RPGs, because role-playing games aren't Works of Art. They're tools, which <i>might</i> be used to create Art, if you must, but aren't necessarily <i>intended</i> for that purpose. Instead, one should judge RPGs in the same way in which one would judge a chair, or a guitar, or bottle of wine -- that is, in terms of both their <i>craftsmanship</i> and their <i>usefulness.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223390/#Comment_223390" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T06:11:23+00:00" title="August  8, 2009  6:11AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Ron Hammack&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course, none of that has anything to do with RPGs, because role-playing games aren't Works of Art.

I'm not sure about musical scores and movie scripts but I wouldn't be surprised if they were too.<br/><br/>EX Mainstream bookstore employee (the biggest one) here.<br/><br/>Yes, scores and scripts are there too. Not a huge selection, but enough so that you know that they are carried. I've tried over the years to get RPGs, smaller comics and whatnot into sections with varying degrees of success. The high-point was when I had that huge copy of Nobilis sticking out among all the White Wolf.<br/><br/>Honestly though, the best way to get an indie game into a big store (I'm not as sure about Borders), would be to contact the Community Relationship Manager of the store and talk to them about setting up a small event. A signing/demonstration with the author or just setting up a group, kind of like a book group. This might work well with the kid's department. If anyone wants to do this, I'll happily walk them through it, just let me know.<br/><br/>Back to the OP, I think the visual presentation of a game book has a huge influence on not just where it's displayed, but what impressions it gives to potential players. I don't understand why anyone who actually wants to sell their game wouldn't spend time, effort, money, or talent on the design and packaging of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223438/#Comment_223438" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T11:50:25+00:00" title="August  8, 2009 11:50AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely intend to go around to the local bookstores in this area\u2014the city of Northampton <i>alone</i> has at least 4 of them\u2014when I finish <i><a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a></i> and try to get them to carry it.

They have a rock-hard certainty that the genre can do worthy things, and that doing less is a <i>failure</i>, and that really does make a palpable difference in the material that comes out.  The comic companies can put out so many trade paperbacks of recent comics because there's a serious richness of material that (if not always great) consistently measures up to at least a basic level of minimum quality.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know whether I think there is or <i>should be</i> a parallel for roleplaying games.  Yes, looking at <i>My Life with Master</i> convinced me that game design could do worthy things ... but years before that, really good gaming experiences that I'd had convinced me that the act of play could do worthy things.  And I suspect that the number of gamers who believe that actual play can be worthy and serious is vastly greater than the number who believes game design is a serious business.  Honestly, for all the time I spend trying to design worth-while games, I spend (and hope to continue to spend) more time trying to make worthy experiences come out of the fleeting and ephemeral medium of actual play.<br/><br/>I don't know that that's a bad thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223605/#Comment_223605" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T01:56:37+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  1:56AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was writing a very annoyed tirade about how tired I am at people trying to seek validation in the eyes of mainstream critics, and as a result disparage things they don't know about in order to validate a single genre that academics have co opted as "real serious literature."<br/><br/>I do not see the point in engaging in this behavior, nor in the idea that GAMES should pursue this kind of twaddle because comics have already succumbed to pretentious Art-Spiegelman types.

Superhero comics are an offshoot of the big history of the form, which for historical reasons have become one of the best-known and widely-spread.<br/><br/>It's telling that the most widely-respected superhero comics are actually somewhat deconstructive; i.e. <i>Dark Knight</i> and <i>Watchmen</i>; also the early issues of <i>Love &amp; Rockets</i>.<br/><br/>Compare roleplaying games: they are a medium, within which much is possible. Jason Morningstar, Julia Bond Ellingboe, and Emily Care Boss, among others, have demonstrated that it is possible to make a game that steps beyond sf and fantasy (more broadly, action-adventure genres). All of a sudden the entire world of possibilities is broadened.<br/><br/>Imagine if all of literature were sf or fantasy and the only books about real, human people living recognisable lives were a few outliers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223758/#Comment_223758" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T15:33:16+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  3:33PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one has suggested that be the case.

Watchmen is with graphic novels. Every book I listed is on Time's 100 best novels list, which I would say makes them broadly acceptable as 'serious literature.'<br/><br/>I don't know what this mythical 'serious literature' section is supposed to be. There's a general fiction section, but that stocks Dan Brown just shelves away from Pynchon. I just don't see this denigration of genre fiction. Sure, it gets it's own section, but that's organizational. Shakespeare isn't in general fiction either. I'm sure some gems are missed, but obviously good things can be recognized regardless of genre.<br/><br/>This is kind of the problem RPGs are facing. If mainstream booksellers are to stock indie games, where do they go? Do they define a new section?

And these days I have to go to the children's section to get some of my fantasy books. It's a taxonomy, and an arbitrary one.<br/><br/>I reject that these books are different in a categorical manner. When asked why I read sci-fi/fantasy by condescending people, I answer them, "If I am to read a novel, or a suspense thriller, why not read one where besides being a novel/thriller, I also get a side-dish of an interesting setting?"<br/><br/>And that was a serious non-elitist reply. You're the one who says they are sci-fi/fantasy, the books on the list. I hold that they aren't. Not that they aren't because they are "Higher fiction", and as such we should take them out of the grubby lesser hands of sci-fi/fantasy, but because these books have a goal and a focus, and it is not to create a setting and/or illustrate it, but comment on our own society.<br/>I wouldn't have listed Candide as a fantasy/alternate reality book either.<br/><br/>Part of the reason some books which are no different than these get categorized that way is because of historical inertia, people expect to find them on these shelves, and they are considered canonical but only within these 'genres', so they are there to ease people finding them. This has the sad side-effect of a pseudo-ghetto, where "Mundanes" fear to tread, but that's bull.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223796/#Comment_223796" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T17:18:41+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  5:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I think this tangent should go to another thread, it's going to consume this thread otherwise.

Newman</cite>I think pornographic RPGs might be a damned fine idea.It's funny, but I'm still serious.</blockquote>IIRC, that was one of the notions I floated in the last "how to get mainstream" or "how to get newbies" thread (of which this is yet another variation, through the analogy of comics). Simple games with simple situations, color-rich, that are primarily built to be arousing foreplay. ONE little step beyond freeform, maybe a simple resource mechanic (clothing comes to mind), and a color-rich "setting" and situation (a Bang to start the gang bang, if I may be cheeky).<br/><br/>BUT... at the risk of going back to the original thread....<br/>I think it is safe to say that the notion being batted about ("comics taken seriously") involves these components:<br/>* Mainstream literary critics now take note and write commentary.<br/>* Intended for adult consumption, often including mature themes.<br/>* Available through non-specialty channels (Borders, not FLCS).<br/><br/>SO... the notion is that RPGs can look at the popularization and increased respect that the medium of comics has gained and learn from it. On the surface, that seems to make some sense: look, here's the games right next to the comics in the specialty store... now, wow!, the comics are spreading to the non-specialty store... so surely we can follow.<br/><br/>Well, um, not so much. As others have said, RPGs are more like board games or sporting goods or tool kits than comics. Very active, very participatory, very component- and/or accessory-rich (mostly). Now, one might say, "But they're books!" to which one might respond, "Except when they're PDFs and playing cards and miniatures and pounds of polyhedrons and require roulette wheels and..." And the debate then rages over to, "Well, some or all of that stuff shows up in Borders." To which another would reply, "Maybe some playing cards, because they go with the 500 books on playing Texas Hold'Em. Maybe even some poker chip sets. But packs of 10d10?!?" And the proponent then replies, "Look, here's the Star Wars TCG with the pop-out space ship models" and the opponent says, "Yeah, uh, STAR WARS. You could put the Rebel insignia on a dog turd and sell a couple a week in a Big Box," implying that mass mainstream popularity with a license is what encourages diverse products on that license. And so on. And so on....<br/><br/>In short, this thread suffers most not from definitional uncertainty, nor from radical thread-jacking to talk about genre, nor even from equally radical thread-drift to trust issues. Rather, it suffers the oldest and simplest breakdown of debate: arguments from analogy fucking suck, because there ARE NO true analogs. RPGs won't follow the market-expansion path of comics because they are an utterly different medium serving an utterly different activity agenda, requiring oftentimes unique or specialized accessories to maximize playability or achieve the intended effect of the game system. You're better off with using computer games as an analog, if you remember when the "console market" was bulky units with one to four hard-wired games and the "PC market" was build-your-own Altairs?).<br/><br/>The idea of a Major Computer Games Market was laughable, back when the only games were Pong and Adventure. But somehow they became not only "mainstream," but they now out-strip the movie industry's gross revenue, are considered a serious medium for training and exploration of ethics, and there are even some brushing at the doors of hallowed halls like Modern Art museums and galleries. Mainstream, big money, intelligentsia respect. MORE so than comics, in maybe a quarter to an eighth of the time (depending on when you want to say "comics" started). And the folks in THAT industry STILL talk about "how do we make more addictive casual games for moms and pops" or "how can we expand the game market for women and girls" and so-forth. They got the BIG, BIG bucks and entire stores dedicated to their one medium... and they still wring their hands regularly in Game Developer magazine or on Gamasuta about how to grow and be more "mainstream" or how to be... "taken seriously."<br/><br/>THAT could be a worthwhile thread: <b>What can TT RPGs learn from the meteoric rise of computer gaming and simulation, and for that industries continued push to achieve the REAL mainstream levels of things like, oh, TV shows?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
