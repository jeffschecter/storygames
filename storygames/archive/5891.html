Having arrived home after a long bus ride where the driver missed a turn along the way, I am sitting in our living room, contemplating after midnight while the rest of the family are sound asleep. There were a couple of oranges left in the fruit basket, so I am sipping a screwdriver or two.<br/><br/>We are a number of guys running Games on Demand at Conpulsion in March, and since Vincent is the celeb guest this year I thought it would be appropriate to offer some of his games, other than Dogs that is. But not without playing them first, hence last night's IAWA.<br/><br/>Players were me, as GM and only one who had read the rules text beforehand, Pooka, who I've played with quite a lot lately, and Pooka's friend Raf. Raf plays in Pooka's weekly Wild Talents game and has recently been exposed to indie goodies such as PTA and Dogs, so he was more than up for trying IAWA. In fact, Raf had ordered the PDF the same day we played. I know Pooka is not entirely hot about Sword and sorcery/pulp fantasy, but he was keen anyway because he knows how ubercool Dogs works in play.<br/><br/>I re-read the rules in the afternoon, as I had this idea that I couldn't remember a thing. I also spoke to my friend Peter who stressed the absence of stakes or intent in the game. The only thing I was definitely shaky on was the multi-person conflict example - man, didn't I get that by reading through it twice.<br/><br/>Considering everything, I think we played for a couple of hours, maybe two and a half, and I enjoyed it along with Pooka and Raf, although it was a relatively quiet affair (considering the source material), especially because the two players were very...cautious? Every conflict came from me stressing or harrassing the player characters - IIRC there were no situations were a player character wanted something that I as the GM wouldn't give them.<br/><br/>Many things in IAWA are left to the individual group's interpretation - our first realisation of that was Pooka asking when he was writing his character down on the character sheet. He wanted to know what the different forms covered. "No idea," I said, "and it doesn't say in the book." Pooka looked stunned. "Really?" I think he was considering were it would be 'best' to place his different dice and the game just doesn't play ball like that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Wonderful moment.<br/><br/>The evening's last conflict was the voluptuous wifey serpent-demoness Ku Aya (take that!) ritualistically killing her husband, the honest farmer Javid played by Pooka, to make him into a serpent-demon, right there on their kitchen floor. Or trying to kill at least, because we both rolled an 8 and a 5, I think. Re-rolling the lower dice both came up a 4! We dedided if anything was a tie, this was it, so Javid is still alive.<br/><br/>Pooka, Raf, chime in, as always.<br/><br/>Oh: the Owe list. YES!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131880/#Comment_131880" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-01T08:20:53+00:00" title="March  1, 2008  8:20AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I feel guilty that I didn't post an AP of the game we played at our end of town Per, I should do that                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Raf" title="Raf"><img alt="Raf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Raf">Raf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131990/#Comment_131990" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-02T16:47:16+00:00" title="March  2, 2008  4:47PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'll venture a few thoughts on the game from my point of view.\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">it was a relatively quiet affair (considering the source material), especially because the two players were very...cautious?

For me, it was an excellent session, as it had that classic fantasy "calm before the storm" vibe. From my experience, a great many fantasy tales start with a gentle lead in (Lord of The Rings, Earthsea, the Belgariad etc.), painting the world in broad strokes as the storm clouds gather. I liked that the game emulated that fairly well. Things need time to snowball. To be honest, I imagine part of the lack of conflict was us just adjusting to what you can actually <i>do</i> with the system, and judging when a conflict is appropriate. I'm finding, now that I've had a chance to read the book more thoroughly, that conflict seems to be the intended driving force, and I'm unsure about that. I'm partly dubious because I don't quite yet have the hang of the resolution mechanics, and as such I don't really see the dice as adding anything in the way of tension or impetus. In Dogs, you have clear escalating representations of what you stand to gain or lose. In IAWA, not so much it would seem. But in all fairness, I'd like to give it a fair shot with a few more sessions. Now I'm aware of the concept of advantage dice it makes a little more sense, and there seems to be implications of a mythic back and forth in the conflicts which would be nice. Whereas on the night I was just, "Oh, the NPC's get another d6. Weird." Again, nothing that can't be worked out with another session or two.So, I guess I need to let the system grow on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the Oracles are the high point of the game, thematically perfect, and far less forced and awkward than say, <i>Shock's</i> grid. Being able to make up your own intersections and interactions rather than having them dictated and parcelled out for you is a blessing.<br/>\nAs for the\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Owe list. YES!</div>\n</blockquote>\nI'm more around the Owe list: Hmm. While I like aspects of it - setting yourself at a disadvantage in order to gain advantage later, I'm slightly dubious about the concept of using it to buy a character into a future chapter. Personally, if I'm playing a character I enjoy, it's nice to just keep playing him, rather than have to orchestrate the specific circumstances in which I would be <i>permitted</i> to keep playing him. Again, maybe this'll grow on me.<br/>\nLooking up at that, it looks a bit grumbly. I did enjoy the game, most certainly, but I think it's yet to click.<br/>\nMore thoughts as and when I take Mr. Scabb for another jaunt around the black streets of Svart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132018/#Comment_132018" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T04:22:52+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  4:22AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2008 4:45AM by Per_Fischer.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for feeding your impressions back, Raf, much appreciated.

She said in an email "I have to realise that every scene doesn't have to end with a change of reality", which equates quite well to "You can have plenty of scenes where you (as the GM) are happy to give the players everything". <br><br>The vibe in both games is that you narrate by consent until the point where someone says "Oh no you don't!" and demands a conflict. That works on both sides. If the players like the direction of the story and what is happening by mutual consent, then they go with it. If the GM thinks that what is asked for is something he is happy to give, then go with it. I think this is what the IAWA text means by circling and avoiding conflicts. You have a conflict when someone is unhappy with what another character is doing and wants to step in and stop them. If the GM thinks the story is lacking tension, or if an NPCs best interest is not being served, then they can step and try and do something to the players and see what happens.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132169/#Comment_132169" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T15:23:59+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  3:23PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yikes. Sorry I've taken so long to respond here, by my computer <i>died</i> this weekend. I nearly lost everything. It's mostly better now, though.<br><br>Right, so here are my thoughts reflected from Per's post.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>I re-read the rules in the afternoon, as I had this idea that I couldn't remember a thing.

I don't think we covered how the system really closes conflict, and as such felt a bit adrift. I get it now (thanks for the loan, Per! I get the rules pretty completely) and totally understand multi-person conflict, no problems. It's actually quite elegant, in it's way. My concern is that a conflict where neither party is able or willing to negotiate and has to come down to Injury or Exhaustion could go on for a long time. I think that could seriously suck. Hopefully that won't happen, mind you, but if you get a really obstinate player it's almost a forgone conclusion.\n<blockquote>Considering everything, I think we played for a couple of hours, maybe two and a half, and I enjoyed it along with Pooka and Raf, although it was a relatively quiet affair (considering the source material), especially because the two players were very...cautious?

The text doesn't make it very clear, but I think the reason my character didn't seem motivated was because, frankly, he <i>wasn't</i>. My Best Interests for Javid were both things <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> wanted for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">him</span>, and they were not immediately actionable. Next time I suggest we make Best Interests something the character is aware of and striving for - I reckon our problems will largely dissipate after that.\n<blockquote>Many things in IAWA are left to the individual group's interpretation - our first realisation of that was Pooka asking when he was writing his character down on the character sheet. He wanted to know what the different forms covered. "No idea," I said, "and it doesn't say in the book." Pooka looked stunned. "Really?"

However dice aren't a determiner of competence, rather a statement of likely success. I mean, you're not going to let me roll Directly + With Love for a military ambush, right? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>A question - pg. 14 includes an example where if the player is using violence, he <b>must</b> roll With Violence. But what if I want to roll Directly and For Myself, instead? However it seems that die choice just mandates colour, so it's not a mechanical issue as long as the choice is acceptable to the group.\n<blockquote>Oh: the Owe list. YES!</blockquote>\nI need to see this in action first, but I see potential greatness. Or potential irritation.
