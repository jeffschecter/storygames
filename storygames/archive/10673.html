I've found a good technique for large-group InSpectres play is to let the group naturally split into two or three groups each off investigating some facet of the case, and cut back and forth between them quickly, This keeps the energy pretty high, and because a lot of the fiction is generated by the players actions, not as exhausting for the GM as it sounds. Also, you want to have a goal of, like, 30 franchise dice minimum if you want a game longer than an hour.<br/><br/>Agon works cuz it's awesome. Well, really, cuz the play structure is very simple and once everyone gets the mechanics, the GM pretty much just needs to pay attention to the monsters. I would recommend having a couple of easy fights so that everyone gets the handle of things, and then keep an eye on the problem that occasionally pops up where the fight is certainly going to go in the heroes favor, but they just...can't...get...that....last...hit...in - especially on a Monster with good defense powers. I usually let that go for about a round and then have the heroes have a contest among themselves to see who gets the killing blow in.<br/><br/>Hope some of that helps!<br/><br/>*disclosure: carry is one of my games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236780/#Comment_236780" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T09:35:10+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  9:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a difference between games that simply <i>work</i> with 5-6 players, and games that are <i>optimized</i> for 5-6 players.

I'm sure <i>Poison'd</i> works great with big groups because it feeds off the same dynamic as TMW. From what (little) I know of <i>Carry</i>, it wouldn't surprise me to hear that it works well with big groups. PTA I would NOT call "optimized", it will work with slightly larger groups, but I think its sweet spot is really 3-4 players + GM.

And when I group two or more players together the conflicts become too easy and/or not rewarding or only rewarding for one player. <br/><br/>In my last game, one player, got only one "ok" scene, so I felt bad for him, and near the end of the session, I tryed to put the spotlight on his character, but It was a group scene and in the end it was not very satisfying. <br/><br/>After the session, I was wishing for a game where having 5 players dont bring annoying (workable) complications, but bring interesting situations and gameplay.  <br/><br/>I am thinking that it could be interesting to switch for a game that dont only work for a large group but that also ask for and "enjoy" a large group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo" title="theloneamigo"><img alt="theloneamigo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/546/n3LSBO7Z43MJI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo">theloneamigo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236829/#Comment_236829" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T19:42:19+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  7:42PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10673&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">Lady Blackbird</a> is decidedly optimised for 5 + GM play, and is delightfully engaging.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236919/#Comment_236919" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T13:49:22+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  1:49PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like that link is weird.
