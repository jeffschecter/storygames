They are very good at violence, and like to get drunk and pass out in the streets. Even drunk they are effective killers, though they don't tend to start fights. They are just intolerably rude and self-destructive miscreants. The locals try to entice them to leave, but they won't.<br/><br/>The worst thing is, when they are passed out in the gutters, their nightmares of the war stalk through the streets of New Orleans, made of shadows that bleed red wine, that drink blood and night soil. They go to the Church on holy nights and batter at the windows, demanding to be let inside, where they can wreak more havoc.<br/><br/>One of the men is old and bitter, and wants nothing more than to destroy himself.<br/><br/>One is young and will shun any opportunities for redemption until one is proven to work, then he will take it at once.<br/><br/>And a third is neither young nor old, but if he is told about his nightmares, he will sober up and use them to raise himself to a position of power.<br/><br/>...<br/>howzat work? happy birthday, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115221/#Comment_115221" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T04:37:25+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  4:37AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Juan" rel="nofollow">Jorge Juan y Santacilia</a>, Knight of Malta, polymath, spy.

I'd want this fairy to try to stop silly, frivolous duels but when it is time to go to steel, its time.<br/><br/>Dueling was a very real and very bloody part of early American culture.  Often, political figures would brag about having dueled, quoting it as a rite of passage and people running for office who hadn't dueled would get that thrown in their face, as if they weren't willing to fight for what they believed in (dammit, I'm not sure where I am pulling that from; I'll look up a source or two).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115438/#Comment_115438" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T16:40:39+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  4:40PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think any source on creole (French) New Orleans will tell you the two ubiquities of the culture - dueling and colored mistresses.
