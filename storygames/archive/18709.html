Good solid fortune in the middle mechanics.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the way that gaming the dice encourages players to play to their character's advantages while not feeling straightjacketed. For example, we were out on the docks when the town guard showed up. They had some men on the rooftop with muskets and others inside the warehouse. I looked at my stats and noticed that I was good at Parry but pretty bad at Dodge, plus I was much better at Lunge (the main swordfighting attack skill) and pretty crappy with my pistol. So I rolled an attack at a guy in the warehouse, dropping a die because I was changing locations. I got lots of successes so I was going to be able to Yield him out of the fight (make him surrender/run) and had enough to earn a style point. Knowing that, I narrated that I crashed through the warehouse window, tucked into a roll that took me right into the guys legs, and came up with my knees on his chest and sword at his throat politely requesting his unconditional surrender. Fun stuff.<br/><br/>Basically, the game allows for as much narrative control as you need to flavor things up to the hilt ("of course there is a counterweighted rope there that can launch you up to the roof if you want there to be") without forcing it in ways that can lead to blank page syndrome.<br/><br/>The character sheet and combat playsheet were excellently well designed. I very quickly felt like I had a handle on the basics of the system and how to make it work. Very clean layouts and well presented information.<br/><br/>The game has a fun sense of feminism and gender play. Playing strong female characters seems to be subtly encouraged (though it is far from mandatory) by both the setting and the mechanics.<br/><br/>The mechanics felt well thought out and robust. Just the right amount of "completeness" without too much "long lists of stuff to wade through".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421059/#Comment_421059" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T22:35:27+00:00" title="September  3, 2013 10:35PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, thanks for the feedback, I enjoyed playing with you and everyone else at the con!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421079/#Comment_421079" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-04T15:15:21+00:00" title="September  4, 2013  3:15PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played this at a Strategicon over the weekend.  <br/><br/>I think it's one of the funnest combat &amp; skill systems I've ever come across.  I loved how 'push-button' the game was -- so many hooks and levers to express the character during the course of play.<br/><br/>It has Cortex Plus leanings but is much more fiddly; I mean that in the best possible way. Where Cortex Plus breaks down for me -- I find myself rolling the same thing over and over and over, the narrative interpretation is the only thing changing -- Queen's Cavaliers robust ability to 'spend' on specific methodologies and actions really delivers a very satisfying experience in play. I always felt I was able to finesse actions and skills in a huge variety of ways, through vivid interaction of dice rolling and story needs in the particular moment.<br/><br/>The passion system was really nicely done as well; we didn't get into that as much as I would have liked.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really think you have a winner on your hands here.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that given the genre -- Three Musketeers derring-do 'pulp' -- you need to have a sub-system in place for dealing with mooks and minions. Rachel had us splitting the dice pools but even there that felt like it got quickly difficult to fight more than two opponents.  Again, this doesn't fit the genre where my guy should be holding off four swordsmen and quipping while doing that.<br/><br/>I'll say that I think I've found the perfect system for Iron Kingdoms.<br/><br/>Good job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421089/#Comment_421089" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-04T22:18:36+00:00" title="September  4, 2013 10:18PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Denys!

Which still gave me something to do with my extra success, but it made the combat last more rounds than it needed to.<br/><br/>And on the flipside, you probably need a super easy way for mooks to just add to each other on 1 attack. Maybe they add an extra d6 to the roll (and a higher die type if they are higher ranking baddies).

Though skeptical at the size of the character sheet, they enjoyed it as the mechanics supported the story well.<br/><br/>We addressed the rabble by allowing a character to spend their successes across multiple targets with no penalty (e.g. 4 Success Points could be 2 Yield to 2 different rabble).  While this felt nice, I think mechanically you're usually better off focusing on one opponent, so Caoimhe's suggestion will probably match the work better (though the angry privateer simultaneously wounding two rabble that dared board her ship was a nice scene).<br/><br/>One thing we tried that was fun was giving the privateer's ship rough stats like a character.  When I asked what kind of ship she had (i.e. what's built for), we fleshed out a quick equivalence of:<br/>Verve = Might:  robustness and firepower of the ship (how strong the hulls, how many cannon, etc.)<br/>Affinity = Crew:  the quality of the crew (training, experience, health, etc.)<br/>Guile = Speed:  the speed and maneuverability of the ship (swiftness, ability to go over shoals, etc.)<br/>Then the captain assigned a d6, d8, and d10 to it.  When the crew was helping the captain repel boarders, she added the ship's Crew die to her Lunge pool (rather than rolling for the whole crew as their own set of rabble).  When in a foreign port and the captain telling the crew to stay sharp and keep a low profile (i.e. don't get drunk and start fights), they added the Crew die to her Inspire roll.  When trying to outrun the pursuing ship, she added her ship's Speed die to her Explore roll.  We did have a challenging time coming up with appropriate skills that the captain would use to command her ship, so we tended to use Inspire for nearly everything.<br/><br/>One thing I found myself asking as the GM is why I was rolling opposing dice for unopposed actions (3d6, 3d8, 3d10, etc.), rather than just assigning a difficulty (e.g. That's simple, you need a 9).  However, then I had the brainstorm of the GM having a Success List to go shopping from with their Success Points from the roll that the PC failed against.  The list should be things to make failure interesting, rather than just more bad.  I think the GM Hard Moves list from Apocalypse World is a good starting point.  A good GM will do this anyway, but you may as well have the mechanics support and prompt it.<br/><br/>One of the big things we all commented on is that we would like to see social "combat" fleshed out to a similar degree to regular combat.  You can reuse existing mechanics like Yield and gaining Advantage, but you would be using social skills to do it.  You may even be able to map skills one-for-one (Deceive does a Feint equivalent, Inspire does a Lunge equivalent, etc.).  I think Burning Wheel's Duel of Wits is an inspiration, but dial back the complexity to be like the existing QC physical combat.  This ties in with our other idea that the skill specialty Society could be it's own skill set with three versions of it, which would give some more nuance to the social skills and support social combat more.  (Den suggested History to fill the place of Education's now empty slot).<br/><br/>I have more notes at home from the debrief with the group that I'll share, but I just wanted to offer up some of the thoughts so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421304/#Comment_421304" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T22:14:57+00:00" title="September  9, 2013 10:14PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>  However, then I had the brainstorm of the GM having a Success List to go shopping from with their Success Points from the roll that the PC failed against.

I love the implied action and fun.<br/><br/>The language in the first paragraph --  I have a suggestion for that last sentence.<br/><br/>Currently:<br/>Combat is flexible and designed to be entertaining, with more options than simply doing damage from round to round.<br/><br/>Suggested revision:<br/><br/>"Combat -- and indeed all skill use -- is incredibly flexible. It's been designed to be entertaining with numerous options that allow for lots of creativity while still being mechanically robust. You'll have a blast choosing the various ways to apply your abilities."<br/><br/>or something like that.<br/><br/>Reason is you shouldn't bury the innovate nature of your system -- as someone who's played probably 150 different rpgs over the years, yours felt new and cool. Especially key is that the system doesn't accomplish its goals in a purely handwaivey method; you spell out options in your skill write-ups.<br/><br/>Perhaps add a Fate conversion to your stretch goals? Not sure how popular Gumshoe is -- if I know a hundred gamers, I'm the only one who's ever used it more than once -- but Fate seems like the most beloved of engines right now in the rpg hobby zeitgiest.<br/><br/>Anyway, hope the feedback helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424451/#Comment_424451" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T12:51:26+00:00" title="November 19, 2013 12:51PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I decided to take out the alternate-system stretch goals, and I am taking to heart all that you have said here.

Set a course for adventure in the seas of Ekalia as you're assigned to guard the Queen's envoy to a noble wedding - - a marriage that the enemies of Gallinea want to make sure never happens!
