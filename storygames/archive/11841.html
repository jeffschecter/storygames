Here's the general problem I'd like to solve.<br/><br/>Rather than use 3d minis, I'm going to move to a system of print-out colour counters onto paper and then glue them onto little wooden miniature bases. This gives me a whole bunch of rectangular gaming "tokens" I can use for all the creatures in my gaming other than Player Creatures (who get to use their own 3D minis).<br/><br/>Storage of these tokens will be a heck of a lot easier than traditional minis, and I'll get, pretty much, a collection of tokens that will be "exactly the creatures I need". My thought is to store them in little plastic boxes (plano?), and generally arrange the storage "by adventure/campaign": long term, this will mean that if I ever want to run a campaign or adventure again, I can just grab the right box off the shelf, and get all the minis I need for it right there.<br/><br/>I can see a lot of people raising their hands from the back and saying "but wait! that's not all that efficient, because you're going to end up with duplicates you don't need!". And you'd be right. Those Orc Warriors I'm prepping for tomorrow night's game will no doubt need to be re-used in some adventure/campaign somewhere down the line that is <i>not this particular campaign</i>.<br/><br/>So, really, there's <i>two</i> ways to organize the minis collection: an easy to use "by campaign/adventure" slice, and a method of organizing that's not related to any "campaign/adventure" (i.e. alphabetical by monster name/type). And, no doubt, there will be other ways to slice and dice the inventory.<br/><br/>All this comes down the way to solve this problem: with software. That is, some sort of database that could easily help me manage my collection so I'd know what minis I have, where, and in what box. So, when I'm prepping "containers" for a campaign, adventure, I can easily get a list of all all the minis that might be needed and my physical storage system can be optimized for storage, and not necessarily optimized for play.<br/><br/>So... does anyone have any recommendations for a Macintosh user as far as software for easily setting up a "miniatures collection" inventory tracker? I have two thoughts right off the bat: Bento, and Delicious Library. Neither of these are specifically designed to track these kinds of things, but both are simple purpose, relatively inexpensive apps that can help "track collections", and so might be adaptable for purpose.<br/><br/>Of course, I could just use MySQL and cook up my own, but I don't want to spend that time. I'd prefer to use inexpensive, robust, off the shelf software if I can. I'd like to track records that involve these bits of data:<br/><br/>* Creature name<br/>* Picture of counter that's on the mini<br/>* Size of the mini<br/>* Searchable list of all the campaigns/adventures where that minis has been/could be used<br/>* Storage location<br/>* [Other stuff maybe -- production/component batch information for long-term quality tracking, for example]<br/><br/>Can anyone make a recommendation of something they use?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264374/#Comment_264374" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T11:38:10+00:00" title="March 29, 2010 11:38AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2010 11:39AM by Wordman.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read your whole post with wide, staring eyes, as I would never do anything remotely like this. Yet, I have an answer for you anyway.<br/><br/>The general problem of wanting multiple methods of organization simultaneously can be solved surprisingly effectively using tags. Fortunately, tags as a feature has been a recent trend in OS X software. You might, however, have to bend some notions to follow the path of least resistance.<br/><br/>In particular, you have an idea of "I have this record that represents something and need to organize such records". Instead, see if the following will work for you:<br/><br/>Make the "atomic unit" of your system not the token you have created, but rather the image file used to create it. Then use software that allows you to assign tags, keywords and other metadata to said images, then search on them. For example, an app like <a href="http://www.yepthat.com/deep/" rel="nofollow">Deep</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264480/#Comment_264480" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T07:57:34+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  7:57AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Update:<br/><br/>Delicious Library is a no. Which is sad, because it certainly <i>could</i> be a yes. However, it doesn't let you define "collections" of your own. It provides a series of preset collection types, and uses the bar-code/AmazonID/ISBN as the back end unique key to do automatic data filling from connections to Amazon. If it <i>did</i> let you define your own collection, with your own data fields, for things that didn't necessarily have easy look-up presence on Amazon, the rest of the features (UI, searching, etc) are nice.<br/><br/>Bento is a possibility, but FileMaker's upgrade pricing is non-existent, so it'd be a pricey expense. They seem to offer a test drive, so I could at least see if it'd be a worthwhile expense.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Wordman">@Wordman</a>: I actually considered Deep/Leap, etc. But, the unique key for the inventory can't be the counter image, because of some of the things I want to catalog. At the very least, I want to track supplies used in crafting. This prevents the counter image from being a unique key because it could get used in more than one batch of produced token-minis. I suppose I could use a set of documents to keep track of token IDs, and then use tagging keys to tie all the things together (i.e. counter image, campaign documents, some document containing information on craft supplies used, etc, etc, etc), but to me that's the point of having the DB in the first place: so that the "meta information" that ties everything together can be stored and processed in one place.<br/><br/>I also briefly looked at Yojimbo, but it looks too much like Deep/Leap or DevonThink to do what I want: that is, it's a tool for collecting scraps of your existing content (docs, notes, images, etc).<br/><br/>Still looking... 8)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264515/#Comment_264515" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T11:43:11+00:00" title="March 30, 2010 11:43AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With such a custom set of data to track, I'd just build something in OpenOffice Base. One table, a couple of reports (queries), and two simple forms: one for item record entry, one for selecting a particular report. If you make the table, the first form can be made automatically by the software (but it won't be pretty). Making a report is pretty simple, so you could make reports for various sortings (by location, alphabetically, etc) or even with a variable field (e.g., "Enter figure name" search). I suspect the barebones app could be done in a couple of hours, with a few minute extra per report (to design the query and add a button to call for it).<br/><br/>And you'd learn something about database structures in the process.

I will have a look at OpenOffice. Last time I looked at it on OSX, I wasn't impressed by its monolithic nature, the difficult install and configuration procedure, nor the way it integrated with the OSX fonts/printing system. That was a long time ago.
