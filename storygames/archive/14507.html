It was an intense experience and I\u2019ll post my recollection of events here.<br/>\nThe group is quite tight and some of us have been playing together since the late nineties. We were joined by a friend who usually doesn\u2019t play rpg\u2019s but everyone knows him and he used to play a lot with another group a few years back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>We had everyone but Naomi Bishop as PC\u2019s, so we decided that Naomi died during the pre-game imprisonment.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThe party found their selves imprisoned in a cage, handing above a space-dock at the very bottom of The Hand of Sorrow, blue space under them.<br/>\nSnargle managed to make his way out on top of the cage with the help of Arkams magic and jumped to safety, where he raised a bridge out to the cage.<br/>\nThe PC\u2019s started to make their way to the bridge; Captain Vance bossed his crew around while the Laydy\u2019s wind magic took care of some patrolling guards and left small tornadoes in their trail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><br/>\nEverything is moving at an incredibly quick pace, so I decide to let the PC\u2019s take a quick drink at an unmanned bar somewhere at the middle of The Hand Of Sorrow, to introduce their characters to each other and to introduce the players to the refreshment scene mechanic (all their dice pools where close to exhausted).<br/>\n</i><br/>\n<b>Lady Blackbird</b> is wearing a wedding dress (but a cheap one, to remain incognito), a heavy-weight championship belt and a green punk haircut. Her father, Lord Blackbird, rules over Ilysium with an iron fist. She is not interested in ruling a planet and would rather drink, gamble and party for a few more years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Kale Arkam</b> is a tall and anonymous man, and the other PC\u2019s have a hard time to remember his name. His story is one of loneliness and internal darkness; every time he reaches out to another person he gets hurt and loses more of his sanity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Snargle</b> is wearing baggy trousers and nothing else, since he changes shape a lot. His clan built the Owl and piloting it is one of the greatest honors a common goblin could dream of. Sragle is generally up-beat and happy about most things, especially when danger shows its face.<br/>\n<b><br/>\nCyrus Vance</b> is wearing a wwi style helmet, his old dress uniform and a couple of guns. He is somewhere between Baron Munchausen, Captain Jack Sparrow and the guys from Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He is without a doubt one of the most dangerous persons in the blue yonder.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><br/>\nIt\u2019s about here that I realize that I won\u2019t be able to control anything at that it will be a no-bars hold decent in to madness. So I do what the rules tell me, and make everything the players say true while looking for obstacles.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThe PC\u2019s confronted Hollas at the bridge (he was elevated into some sort of huge pipe organ / typewriter machine that communicated over the wireless), killed a bunch of the crew, locked the hand of sorrow to dive straight into the fog and made their escape in the Owl.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe inside of the Owl is in the image of an English gentlemen\u2019s club with leather furniture, expensive art, a small wine cellar and a humidor for tobacco. The two players who played Arkam and Vance had so much fun just playing their characters on the owl that I could have left them there for the rest of the session, but Snargle and Lady Blackbird were not as overjoyed and the journey continued.<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Blackbird knew of a poker game on an illegal fuel station not far from Haven, where she managed to bet the owl in a game against a Tapir-faced man who knew where Uriah Flint had built his pirate port.<br/>\nArkam is injured since the escape from The Hand of Sorrow and no one aboard the Owl seems to care enough to treat his wounds so he manages to buy a lot of drugs (and vintage porn) to ease the pain during the Lady\u2019s poker game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in the Owl they got attacked by bounty hunters, but Captain Vance rolled a majestic six successes while manning the Laser turret and blew them up. However there was a large harpoon lodged into the Owls hull and it took quite some time to repair, I don\u2019t recall why but the solution included jettisoning all of Arkams personal effects.<br/>\nVance and Arkam where arguing over a box of exclusive bon-bons that had got eaten by someone else then Arkam (who paid for it with several months of his salary) when Arkam found a treasure map that Vance intended to keep for himself, hidden behind a red chesterfield sofa.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter some general confusion the treasure map led them to a pink planetoid in an area of the outer remnants known as Bermuda, where the famous explorer Mario of Mecklenburg had gone missing some time before.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Owl land at the planetoids only port they are greeted by a woman in pink who treats Lady Blackbird as a regular visitor, giving her the royal suite at the hotel etc. The planetoid turns out to be a luxurious resort/bordello with a lot of decadence, tropica drinks, exotic dancers and that whole thing.<br/>\nSnargle remains in town while the rest of the PC\u2019s travel by foot to an abandoned temple where Arkam is about to lose his hand in a strange pleasure-altar and the only way to save him is if the Lady and Captain Vance perform a perfect Marengo.<br/>\nWhen the passionate dance ends the altar releases Arkams hand and he produces a key with the Blackbird family insignia. \u201cI left it here during my last visit\u201d the Lady explains.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the PC\u2019s get back to town there is a mob of hotel guests and staff in pink hair that have captured Snargle. The Captain threatens the mob in to obedience and Snargle is released without blood spill.<br/>\nThe key leads to a deposit box, where the Lady have left her true wedding ring and a bomb that activates when anyone opens the box, just for good measure. They leave the pink planetoid to its destiny and fly on to Uriah Flint\u2019s secret base.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the flight Arkam reveals a bottle he found on the planetoid, containing a shrunken man; it\u2019s the lost explorer Mario of Mecklenburg. Captain Vance makes the shrunken man take an oath of loyalty and releases him from his bottle prison; this also returns Mario back to his regular size.<br/>\n<i><br/>\nAnd oh, I almost forgot:</i> They fooled an aggressive sky squid with a record that made the Owl sound like a larger and more dominant squid (sky squids are blind).<br/>\n<i><br/>\nIt was time for closure, all characters had used almost every key and trait in one way or another and my blood sugar was falling fast.</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFlint\u2019s base is on the inside of a hollowed out asteroid and is a grand display of neon lights, casinos and nightclubs. The Lady tries to make contact with her secret lover but Uriah has no intention of getting married to Lady Blackbird. In fact he is quite convicted that he dumped her a few months back.<br/>\nThe Lady gets furious and demands genocide, whoever kills Flint\u2019s pirates will get her hand in marriage.<br/>\nCyrus Vance realizes that this is his golden opportunity, he will get his title back or even a grander one and the will get the Lady that he desires.<br/>\nSnargle can\u2019t stand this meaningless violence, so he knocks Vance cold and give the Owls command to Mario.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Lady leaves the Owl to find transport back to her parents at Ilysium, she is out of allies and money but there is a lot of both back home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Owl leaves port to claim the bounty on Cyrus Vance\u2019s head, but they did not know of his ability to teleport, Cyrus waits until the perfect time and assassinates the crew in their sleep.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330387/#Comment_330387" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T04:38:05+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  4:38AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your game sounds crazy and wonderful.
