If you need to know which villain will do something next, you can figure it out.  If you're looking for ways to do a callback to an earlier event, the map will guide you to the NPCs who will tie into it.<br/><br/>Admittedly, this is using the relationship map as a GM's tool more than anything else...but that makes more sense to me, seeing as the players probably don't actually <i>need</i> a map to know how their characters feel about the other characters in the game (since that's a large part of what play usually entails), whereas a GM may have dozens of NPC attitudes, goals, and relationships to keep track of, and can really use a handy chart to keep it all straight and reveal potential things they might do next.<br/><br/>The PCs definitely belong on there (good villains should care who the PCs are!), but they don't necessarily have to be the core of the map.  Games where the PCs are actually the spoilers who disrupt the web of relationships between the NPCs are pretty damn awesome and generate all kinds of interesting things.<br/><br/>edit:  It's definitely worth checking out <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6444" rel="nofollow">this thread about Vampire</a> for some really amazingly useful thoughts JDCorley put together about using relationship maps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295774/#Comment_295774" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-03T22:54:01+00:00" title="October  3, 2010 10:54PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>James, I like the AW map <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The sexting bubble made me LOL <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></blockquote>\nI'm glad. I like that too. Just to be clear though, it's not my map. I yanked it off a Forge thread.<br/><br/>It sounds like you could definitely whip up a simple relationship map in your game to help everyone visualize the connections between the PCs and NPCs. Just write down the names of the PCs and NPCs and draw arrows between them as needed, with notes to describe the nature of the relationship. One nice feature of a relationship map is it will suggest where you can impact multiple PCs by focusing on an NPC that touches them. Also it will suggest places where you can link the various NPCs into a network that draws the PCs into the middle of conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295782/#Comment_295782" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-04T04:33:00+00:00" title="October  4, 2010  4:33AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some good examples in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12855" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.
