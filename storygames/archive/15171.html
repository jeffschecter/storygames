But they're pretty different, too. <br/><br/>* Players don't choose their own highlighted stats.<br/>* They change from session to session, NOT based on in-game choices (e.g. the Buyoff).<br/>* They're much more general (types of actions), not specifics (like when you have Key of Love for Lady Blackbird, or want to get married, or whatever)<br/><br/>I've played a bit of Apocalypse World, and I can see that, yeah, in some situations, you have a certain stat highlighted, so you might be more tempted to do a certain thing. "Ok, I WILL use this move this time around, because I have it highlighted. I could use that extra advance."<br/><br/>But what about from the MC's side of the screen?<br/><br/>Keys allow me, as GM/MC to prepare specific situations and make cool stuff and interesting choices pop up in play. I even have my systematic method for generating entire scenes simply from a list of players' Keys.<br/><br/>When you MC, do you keep track of highlights and somehow use that to inform the game? If so, how? What kinds of choices have you made based around highlights?<br/><br/>Or is it just on the player's side that they come into play? (There is nothing in the AW book, after all, which suggest the MC should ever even consider the players' highlighted stats when choosing moves, etc.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344794/#Comment_344794" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T22:47:25+00:00" title="October  3, 2011 10:47PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't pay attention to the players' character sheets at all except for the NPC's and places they provide for me for my MC's moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344795/#Comment_344795" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T23:22:37+00:00" title="October  3, 2011 11:22PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2011 11:28PM by Hans_c-o.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I don't pay attention to the players' character sheets at all except for the NPC's and places they provide for me for my MC's moves.</blockquote>\nDitto. I've run both AW (a lot) &amp; DW (once), and I've never thought a bit about the highlighted stats once I've highlighted them. To my mind, they are highlighted specifically so the player is tempted to take action using moves that use those stats. Highlighting them is more than enough influence on the situation; anything else is a waste and heavy-handed to boot.<br/><br/>People talk about how they're like Keys, but I think they're much more like earning tests in Burning Wheel: you take action, you get experience. In BW this can happen with any skill, depending on the test you need, and in AW/DW this can happen with any stat, depending on which ones get highlighted that session. Now obviously the advancement &amp; reward cycles in BW &amp; AW/DW are like night and day different, but in this one respect how you earn "experience" is very similar. It's tied to taking action. I suppose that's true with Keys as well, but Keys narrow it down, fictionally, quite a bit more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344805/#Comment_344805" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T03:23:03+00:00" title="October  4, 2011  3:23AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keeping track of highlighted stats in AW works a bit differently than in DW, because each stat is associated with a certain type of activity, whereas in DW activities are split between stats. Additionally, highlighted stats do not change character goals, so they do not indicate what characters are going to do just how they are going to go about doing it. <br/><br/>Since activities are split between stats in DW they can indicate which characters are going to be rutted. For example a character with strength and dexterity highlighted would be at a disadvantage compared to someone with strength and wisdom, generally speaking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344825/#Comment_344825" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T09:27:30+00:00" title="October  4, 2011  9:27AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an MC, I just highlight what I am curious about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player might chose to get a Weird move to get the xp.

One nice thing about them is that the group can act as a moderating factor on characters who are advancing faster than others.  If the fighter has STR and DEX highlighted, they will likely power through the XP and advance faster than the rest of the party.  If they get a level ahead of the other players, the party can highlight WIS and CHA next session.  It doesn't nerf the character's effectiveness but it does (likely) change the rate of XP gain and encourage the player to make use of their spotlight time differently.  <br/><br/>Thinking also of my long wait for Diablo 3, it would be awesome to have an "XP Shrine" in the dungeon with a custom move that let you highlight an additional stat for the rest of the session.  In fact, if I do another Dungeon Starter, I think I'm going to call it "D is for Diablo" and do a Diablo hack...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344827/#Comment_344827" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T10:02:15+00:00" title="October  4, 2011 10:02AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, that is SICK!

Also, once you've highlighted my stat, I can use that stat and gain my XP as many times this session as I want (assuming I can justify it within the fiction), but you can decide not to give me fanmail for doing a behavior that got me fanmail from you before. Did I just make the same point twice? Almost. But the point itself stands: I can't really see how fanmail is even close to being as similar to Highlights as Keys are. I mean, Keys are the first thing that popped to mind when I originally read about highlighted stats, simply because certain types of behaviors are governed by certain stats, and only those types of behaviors will net you XP (for this session, at least).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
