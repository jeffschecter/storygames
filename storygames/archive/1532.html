Reports: The Grievance Committee of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America has announced the creation of a special subcommittee to handle authors' complaints about Wizards of the Coast.<br/>
<br/>
The announcement of the subcommittee's creation reads as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Grievance Committee &amp; the Wizards of the Coast<br/>
<br/>
Special News from Griefcom -- a new situation, a new structure, and a call for volunteers: Historically the Grievance Committee has proceeded behind a curtain because most of the cases are resolved quietly, since the science fiction and fantasy community is small, and usually both the offender and the complainant prefer that matters be kept private. Furthermore, we have been able to use the threat of publicity to good effect against offending parties because they needed or wanted to maintain a reputation in the community. As a result, most of the times when we've been able to get justice for our members, it has been because we negotiated quietly with the prospect of publicity as our final gun behind the door.<br/>
<br/>
We are now faced with a new situation, and I think I owe you all some explanation for why we are changing how we work for this case -- and perhaps for others in the future. The purpose is always the same: justice for the writer. But things have changed and how we go about getting it is changing as well.<br/>
<br/>
Griefcom has gradually become aware that there are some sizable number of unfortunate situations surrounding the Wizards of the Coast (WotC) subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc., many of which will clearly rise to the level of a formal grievance. WotC's practices in the areas of intellectual property, royalty reporting and payment, required author approvals, and several other areas all seem to be questionable. Until now, Grievance Committee has assigned grievances to particular "desks" -- one for short stories, one for work made for hire, one for novels, etc. -- because this allowed each individual Griefcommer to develop an area of expertise, and because most desks, except the ever-busy short story and work made for hire, would have only one case every few months, a reasonable workload for one volunteer.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of WotC, the potential complaints would fall across the lines between the desks, and they are far too numerous and require far too much research for any one person to handle them all, let alone to form a coherent picture of the problem. After consultation with the President and the Board, therefore, and with their consent, Grievance Committee is creating a Task Force -- a subcommittee under Griefcom --to investigate and handle all cases arising from writer relations with Wizards of the Coast, including those deriving from its purchase of TSR, and with its parent company Hasbro Inc.<br/>
<br/>
Paul Melko has been appointed to head up the Task Force.<br/>
<br/>
The first order of business for the Task Force is to determine the scope of the problem, so I'm asking that if you have published with TSR, WotC, or any other Hasbro subsidiary, and you've had problems --even if they haven't quite risen to the level you'd call Griefcom about -- please tell Paul about it, right away. In particular, please look over your royalty statements and see if there are irregularities or things that look suspicious (very round numbers for sales time after time, no sales at all except for occasional large numbers, or any other pattern that just doesn't feel like accurate reporting), and please check Amazon or other worldwide online services for unreported foreign editions (i.e. you can buy a foreign translation but no numbers for it have been reported on your royalty statements) . We need to hear about your other complaints as well, but those are places to look if you're suddenly wondering if everything is as all right as it should be.<br/>
<br/>
Just to find out how numerous and how bad the problems are, we have to break our traditional silence this much. We think the number of writers being harmed may be very large, and we hope to be able to locate as many of them as possible, and to take steps to secure their rights and quite possibly their money. If you've written for WotC --and many of our writers have, they're one of the major markets out there -- and you think there's something rotten at WotC, you should contact Paul at once. He and his Task Force need to know about it. We are more than willing to hear complaints in confidence, if that is your choice.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this is a call for volunteers. We need more staff for the Task Force.<br/>
<br/>
Any member willing to do the sort of pure nuts and bolts Griefcom work of plowing through contracts, royalty statements, correspondence and so forth to establish the what-when-where is very welcome, and no experience is necessary for that, though attention to detail and willingness to learn are helpful; we would be especially happy to have volunteers who have been on the other side of the desk in the publishing industry, and who have worked in the areas of publishing law, accounting, licensing, or rights &amp; permissions. If you'd like to volunteer, please contact Paul or me at the addresses below.<br/>
