As you noticed, I've whittled the list down to those games I am familiar with. With many of them, you do have a point. Universalis does indeed have a great potential for long-term play. The kick I get out of it is being able to create things on the fly. In the Wicked Age game I have played in, the long-term draw was to see if I could get my favorite character shoehorned into a story. Dogs and Great Power have the draw of seeing the changes occur, as with PTA. Burning.. I am not sure of, because the Wheel reads very much like a traditional RPG. Spirit is treated as a Pick-up game, without long-term in mind.<br/><br/>However, when most people criticize Story Games for having a low replay value, they tend to look at The Mountain Witch, The Fisherman's Wife, Dirty Secrets, or Zombie Cinema. These are all excellent games, but their focus is so incredibly tight that it kills any long-term replay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276919/#Comment_276919" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-19T22:11:52+00:00" title="June 19, 2010 10:11PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2010 10:13PM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I have never understood this complaint, at all, period.

Are you saying that by limiting your consideration to only one-shot games you can come to the conclusion that all games are non-playable in the long term? Sort of like if you decide to only look at fishes, you can conclude that animals can't survive outside water?<br/><br/>I'm also seeing an interesting side-issue here in your last sentence in #6: it starts with "low replay value" and ends with "kills any long-term play". Then we have "campaign-play", which is again another concept. These three things are not equivalent, and they have complex relationships in different games! For example, there are games that do not have long-term play, but have a high replay value; many boardgames and quite many roleplaying games have this - one of my favourites of all time, The Mountain Witch, is rather replayable despite not having long-term play. Even more incidiously, there are games that have campaigns but no replay value, those that have long-term play without campaigns, lack of replayability despite having long-term play but no campaigns... these concepts can be combined in almost any way and still yield some game that fits the criteria.<br/><br/>Also, replay value is in the eye of the beholder. I've never seen this complaint applied to a game that actually doesn't have replay value, interestingly enough; rather, it's just a veiled claim that if a game does not have variety in the ways the speaker is used to, then there's no point in playing it more than once. I usually hear this applied to the Mountain Witch, which is ironic for me when I remember the fact that I've played the game through what, a over a dozen times at least. So the claim of "no replay value" simply doesn't hold true in the simplistic manner the guy who's only ever played plot-based games thinks it does. I haven't heard many people say that Zombie Cinema doesn't have replay value, but the same goes for that game: I have not met one person owning the game who hasn't played several sessions, usually in quick succession when they get the game. (Some have said that they probably don't want to play it again for months afterwards, though.)<br/><br/>As if that isn't enough, even something as innocuous as "campaign" can be a rather arbitrary concept. For example, a game like In a Wicked Age does not retain any sort of plot or character unity, but it does have what most recognize as campaign structure. Similarly it is relatively trivial to play a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead" rel="nofollow">Walking Dead</a> campaign with Zombie Cinema simply by starting each session with new character draws, bringing back old characters as desired and continuing play in the same setting continuity where the last game ended. Or take <i>Shock:</i>, which sort of has a campaign play mode, but of all the ten to fifteen plays of the game I've witnessed or discussed first-hand only one actually became a multi-session campaign - just two or three sessions, though, I seem to remember. Campaign is a matter of desire as well as system.<br/><br/>I know that I'm just ripping apart your terminology, but now that I think of it, "Long-term play" isn't a very solid concept, either. The idea that the same group of people gets together regularly to play a roleplaying game works just as well even if you never play a campaign. It is entirely feasible for the group to start every session by choosing what to play and perhaps end the session with a decision of whether to continue playing the game next week, or whether to swap to a different game. Boardgamers do this sort of thing routinely, and Forge-style roleplayers tend to as well: most people I've met have no trouble at all with keeping in touch and arranging sessions with their friends long-term even if the individual games they play only last 1-3 sessions for the most part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276928/#Comment_276928" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T05:48:08+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  5:48AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I really don't want to make this discussion about the argument that Story Games are for the short term only. I've put this in the Game Design Help category because it is about the psychology of the games involved. True, "campaign play" and "replay value" can be treated as mutually exclusive. Its easy to mix the two of them up. There are a number of games that I would love to play over and over, but they do not allow me to slip into a continuation of the same story. How many times can you go up the Mountain to kill the Witch? Can you do it week after week with the same group of friends?<br/><br/>Traditional RPGs reward the players participating in long-term play by allowing them to collect cool stuff and become more Awesome as play progresses.

This thread should start over, from the beginning, to talk about what you REALLY wanted to talk about. The "open-ended campaign play mode with powering-up characters", or, in short, "D&amp;D play".<br/><br/>It's a very specific and enclosed way of playing, that absolutely doesn't fill the entire range of "long-term" play.  And it's true that is less present in Indie Games that in the rest of the marketplace.<br/><br/>Why? I think that the principal reasons are economic and creative. Creatively, it's a very limiting and derivative design. You can't really do a Narrativist game that way (stories have endings), and if you go for a gamist design, it's difficult already to balance a game with characters that have a limited range of power, think about doing that from 1st to 20th level...  it's so difficult that, in reality, nobody ever did it: it's assumed that in these games the GM is the one who must "balance" everything (even retroactively, using rule zero), not the game.  At the end you do a lot of work and people will say to you "all you did was a D&amp;D clone" (or Rolemaster clone, or Vampire Clone, etc.). And it doesn't really make a lot of sense, talking money, trying to sell a D&amp;D clone without enough starting capital (even if you had written Pathfinder, anyone would buy it if you would sell from your garage with no money for ads?)<br/><br/>By the other way, the D&amp;D Clone is the kind of design (the only one, really) where "traditional roleplaying design" excels. There are a lot of them, for every setting and for every taste. The market is not only filled, it's already overflowing, and it's shrinking because it's the kind of design that most suffer the hits from World of Warcraft and other online games.<br/><br/>Some aspects from this kind of design are taken by some indie games, like for example Burning Wheel or The Shadow of Yesterday, but with enough differences to put them outside that design paradigm (for example, the game objective in both is NOT to get more powers and items. In tSoY for example getting too much "power" will make you lose your character). The question is: are these game retaining enough of what you like about the "D&amp;D play" to be what you are searching for, or it's not enough?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276938/#Comment_276938" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T08:20:08+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  8:20AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Heraldic</cite>designed to be enjoyed over a long period of repeat play, i.e. a campaign</blockquote>\nI did forgot another game that is made to be played in this long-term mode, with characters that star "small" and go to change the face of empires, but in a very different way from traditional role-playing: did you ever play "Trollbabe"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276944/#Comment_276944" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T09:40:27+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  9:40AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2010 9:45AM by JDCorley.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>The "open-ended campaign play mode with powering-up characters", or, in short, "D&amp;D play".<br/><br/>It's a very specific and enclosed way of playing, that absolutely doesn't fill the entire range of "long-term" play.

People cite the transcendence mechanic as this huge difference, but I don't really see how it differs fundamentally from the end-game of Mentzer D&amp;D, to pick an example. All editions of D&amp;D have had maximum levels in practice if not in theory, and most groups will call the campaign quits or retire the character when he's grown larger than the setting, becoming a ridiculous and unchallenged godly figure. Most will retire their characters sooner than that, in fact. And of course 3rd and 4th edition characters will end play when they hit the scheduled campaign-end at 20 or 30 levels, respectively. Of course there are vast differences in attitude of play and all sorts of things between D&amp;D and TSoY, but D&amp;D has always been played in many different ways; I myself played D&amp;D in a very TSoY-like manner through the early years of this decade.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276983/#Comment_276983" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T17:16:17+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  5:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><br/><br/>If this is what you were talking about, the issue is not long-term play, re-playability, or any of the other things people believed this thread was about.

I want to know what hooks Story Games have.<br/><br/>In the case of endings.. I love them, too. This may seem to run counter to my stated desire to design a game that rewards the players for playing long-term, but it does not. In the movies, does the end of the movie end the characters? Not when you have sequels. You can always tell new stories about them. On TV, the characters may be put through their paces each episode, but there can also be a story arc threaded through them all to tie them together. And don't get me started on the Dresden Files.

I fail to get into the club because I'm wearing a tank top, and the GM doesn't think tank tops are sexy on boys. (He's wrong, for the record.) Later, we fail to find out the information again because we literally don't have a clue. We are seriously non-awesome spies. The GM says that this is like James Bond's first mission.

One of our team is a sniper. He's shooting bad guys in the airport from a mile away over the shoulders of the negotiator, who's gotten their guard down.

The GM and/or the group very explicitly slowed down or removed as much of the "character growth" or "level up" elements of these games. They wanted to explore certain characters, certain situations, certain challenges, and the rapid accrual of powers and "leveling up" tended to ruin that. For instance, I played in a GURPS game where the characters were diplomats and policemen keeping peace on a difficult planet. The regular rate of advancement would have turned the characters into superheroes or supercompetent "adventures" much much faster than was a) believable, and b) would have made the situation we were playing out impossible to continue.<br/><br/>Same in D&amp;D: our characters were, say, knights in a small barony's court. Or something like that. We were attached to the local Baron, the local innkeeper, whatever--leveling up to the point where these people were so weak and pathetic as to be below the "heroes" did not appeal to anyone--rather, it would have ruined the game.<br/><br/>Sometimes, this took the form of the GM simply "forgetting" to give out the XP awards.<br/><br/>In the games where XPs and advancement points and such WERE given out (even if it was at a very slow rate), then the players usually "forgot" to spend them, except in cases where the character as written didn't match the character concept at creation ("I really envisioned Mack as handsome, but I didn't have the points at creation, so now I'm buying the 'Attractive' advantage"--but we all knew Mack was good-looking all along).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277072/#Comment_277072" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T08:30:51+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  8:30AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To add: I guess many of these groups found that regular "advancement" rules tended to move so fast that the characters pretty quickly outgrew the story, breaking the mold and making further play painfully awkward and hard to "buy" in terms of believability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277079/#Comment_277079" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T10:07:44+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 10:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conspiracy of Shadows is another game I'd add to the "made for long-term play" list.<br/><br/>In Burning Wheel, the trait vote and the epiphany are the long-term game mechanisms (though Practice and Lifestyle Maintenance would also count, I suppose). Trait votes occur every 6 to 12 sessions or so and allow the other players to provide you with feedback on how you've been playing your character by giving them the ability to add, change or remove one or more of your character's traits. It's a recognition of how your character has changed over time.<br/><br/>The epiphany is an even longer-term mechanism. It should take between 30 and 50 sessions of play to shade-shift an ability by regular artha investment. It's a huge reward and provides a wonderful feeling of accomplishment.<br/><br/>Re: Sorcerer: When you resolve your Kicker, you get to roll to advance your abilities in whatever order you choose, but must stop once you roll successfully.

In the book, he has no doubts he will be king and acts more like a catalyst.)<br/></li><li>Samwise gains the bravery to ask Rose out.<br/></li><li>Frodo is so wounded by the experience, he must go to the West for a chance to heal.<br/></li><li>Merry and Pippin become warriors.
