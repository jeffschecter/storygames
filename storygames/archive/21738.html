Forest everywhere. Inflorenza is the game to live in hell, to fight for your soul and to die of love.<br/><br/>we are looking for born english-speakers proofreaders, so please contact me if you are interested<br/><br/>"North, under the silent stars" is a theater from the Inflorenza book. It has been writen by Julien Delorme.<br/>Far in the north is a village, said to be the last one before the ice. Its inhabitants live in perpetual winter, nights last ten months and no one prays to the sun, too weak to grant any wishes.<br/><br/>We try to show all the respect we have for native Sami people which are the protagonists of this theater. But as we are not natives and as this is roleplay (fictionial and partly improvisated), we may have made some mistakes and misinterpretations, so please tell us in the comments. This disclaimers also applies for animal cause issues.<br/><br/>C\xf4me (english translator of Inflorenza) plays Wild Cub, a human transforming into animal.<br/>Orane plays Slow Crow, a young reindeer raiser <br/>I (author of the french version of Inflorenza) play Shaman Wolf, the masked arm of the ritual of killing.<br/><br/>C\xf4me and Orane are french but their english is fluently. Mine is unfortunately far from perfect, i thank you for you leniency <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This actual play is in public domain.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475486/#Comment_475486" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-18T08:51:58+00:00" title="July 18, 2018  8:51AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drat!

It is self-published, it is non-profit (pdf are available for free, and i don't make any benefit on the print-on-demande book) and text is in the public domain<br/><br/>The second edition is in progress. It will include enhancements due to a thousand playtests : minor rule changes that bring more fluidity, extra playing advices and many new playsets. <br/><br/>This second edition will be released in french and in english but it remains indie-to-the-core : self-published, non-profit, text in the public domain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas_Munier" title="Thomas_Munier"><img alt="Thomas_Munier" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nOYK4N60WLYH6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas_Munier">Thomas_Munier</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475523/#Comment_475523" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-19T07:26:04+00:00" title="July 19, 2018  7:26AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This is very interesting, Thomas.<br/><br/>I'm a good proofreader.

How long is the text?</p></div></blockquote>\nPaul, i feel very grateful for you interest and your support offer.<br/><br/>The first part in need of proofreading will include the core rules, the main playing advices and the playset, for a sum of about 64000 words. The translator is finishing the core rules so this first part will be available for proofreading before this autumn. I will let you know.<br/><br/>Just so everybody knows, as Inflorenza is a non-profit RPG, all collaboratives are unpaid. If you're a professionnal proofreader, i would'nt want to let you spend a part of your work time doing an unpaid task.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
