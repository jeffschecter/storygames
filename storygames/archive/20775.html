With either option there is no black and white, in terms of morality, there is only a lot of grey; people have to make very hard choices. The PCs can choose either route.<br/><br/>There needs to be all the things you mentioned as well as a lot of misdirection (where things are not what they appear);and especially, there must be a lot of things happening with NPCs "offscreen" if that makes sense, and a way to implement and track that in an elegant fashion.  All NPCs have their own motives and long term goals. I'm having a bit of trouble modeling this in a narrative first kind of way; I'm finding that their are so many variables that my game is becoming too complex and ridden with rules.  I need my game system to be more elegant and simplified. Also, my game is super hard on the GM so I'm trying to lighten their load. I am hoping to look at other systems for inspiration and to see if they offer any solutions.  Thank you so much for any help or contributions; I think that Story Games is the right place to ask because there are a lot of exceptional people with a lot of exceptional ideas.                               </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456221/#Comment_456221" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T18:52:01+00:00" title="September 12, 2016  6:52PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, what are you hoping to hear in this thread that you didn't in the other thread?

Basically, the whole game is based on intrigue (in a humourous way). It is assumed that you constantly backstab your fellow players. The handbook contains advice like i.e. avoid walking in the first row of your "team" because someone can shoot you "accidentally".<br/><br/><b>Hillfolk/DramaSystem</b> also puts you directly in conflict with every other player (and with yourself). There is something you want from each of them.<br/>So, this eventually leads to some sort of intrigue etc.<br/><br/>But as others have pointed out, any game with relationships can be interesting I guess (Monsterheart <i>Strings</i>, Smallville relationship map...).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456228/#Comment_456228" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T20:24:23+00:00" title="September 12, 2016  8:24PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, yes, Player Versus Player in any systems models intriguing well, because the players are intriguing against one another with their characters as proxies. The GM then acts as note-passer and official knower of 'The Truth.'\n<blockquote> I'm having a bit of trouble modeling this in a narrative first kind of way; I'm finding that their are so many variables that my game is becoming too complex and ridden with rules.  <br/><br/>I need my game system to be more elegant and simplified.

You can sit down and work out a million-part system of interlocking point-buy social ladders but you're never, ever going to replicate humans being assholes to humans and make it feel as good as it does organically.

Like, Sorcerer requires a lot of attention and upkeep, Dogs in the Vineyard requires a lot of dice/stats, and Burning Empires requires both.  Sometimes those tasks are natural and easy and fun, and other times they aren't.  I think it depends on the fictional situation, the cast of characters, etc.<br/><br/>I've found the easiest way to keep this sort of thing manageable is to use a small and tightly-interwoven cast.  With 4 player characters and 4 NPCs who really matter, such that every single scene you play boils down to those 8 characters, GMing-by-NPCing can get pretty easy!  But that may not be suitable for the sort of fiction you're aiming for; I dunno.<br/><br/>I find that "PC1 wants A from NPC1; PC2 wants B from NPC1" is a good place to start.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456234/#Comment_456234" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T23:40:27+00:00" title="September 12, 2016 11:40PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think keeping the main NPCs to managable size is a very good idea <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Thank you for all you suggestions, David. As always, you are full of great ideas. I think getting into posting it would be way too confusing as I have not put it in a form that would be understood by others at this point.

Thank you for your willingness to help <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>My game gives <b> Advantage(s)</b> and <b>Disadvantage(s)</b>: in certain circumstance for different fictional elements and occurrences.<br/>Broadly these are as follows:<br/><b>Situational</b>: these are things that can affect the narrative <b>temporarily</b> in any given scene. They consist of things like the following (this is not an exhaustive list):<br/>Location, physical obstacles, features of the environment, and relative position of the characters and NPCs <br/>Circumstances and factors that affect the behavior or psychological state of character(s) or NPC(s)<br/>Sudden changes in a character\u2019s or NPC\u2019s capacities or status; momentary conditions or injuries <br/>The state of affairs, and/or combination of circumstances and factors acting on the character(s) or NPC(s); anything that could affect the players or NPCs given the situation<br/>Any contextual details that affect the fiction or come into play <br/><b>Character Traits</b> consisting of a <b>Weakness</b> and <b>Strength</b>. Players choose these and they are, and work similar to, aspects in fate core; albeit in more restrictive and realistic fashion. They can be called upon to affect the narrative <b>temporarily</b> in any given scene.<br/><b>Physical Harm:</b> these are any <b>ongoing </b> or <b>permanent</b>   physical conditions or injuries that affect the narrative.<br/><b>Mental Harm: </b> these are any <b>ongoing</b> or <b>permanent</b> metal conditions or injuries that affect the fiction.<br/><b>Social Status: </b> these are any <b>ongoing</b>  or <b>permanent</b>  social conditions that affect the fiction in regards to relationships, social developments, social circumstances or other social states of affair that can affect the fiction.<br/>There are also two types of special categories of Social Status that are tracked as well:<br/><b>Trust &amp; Distrust</b>: any <b>temporary</b>, <b>ongoing</b> or <b>permanent</b> factors that affect the trust or distrust of an NPC in relation to a given PC; for example, a PC being caught in a lie by an NPC <br/><b>Leverage</b>: any <b>temporary</b> or <b>ongoing</b> factors that give the PCs or NPCs leverage in a given relationship; for example, a PC knowing something about an NPC that can be used as leverage to make the NPC do something (e.g. threatening to tell the NPC\u2019s spouse about an affair the NPC is having)  <br/><b>Secrets</b>: any <b>temporary</b>, <b>ongoing</b> or <b>permanent</b> physical, mental, or social factors that are secret or hidden from the PCs<br/><br/>The main problem is that there is a lot of moving parts and that these things are difficult for the GM to keep track of and remember, and if the GM asks the PCs what factors on their character sheets could result in an <b>Advantage(s)</b> and <b>Disadvantage(s)</b> it can be cumbersome, interrupt the fiction somewhat and take the PCs out of the story.<br/>Different <b>Advantages</b> and <b>Disadvantages</b> are currently tracked as follows:<br/>\tPCs track (on their character sheets) <b>Character Traits</b>, <b>Physical Harm</b>, <b>Mental Harm</b>, any <b>ongoing</b> or <b>permanent </b>social conditions other than <b>Leverage</b> and <b>Trust &amp; Distrust</b>.<br/>\tGMs track (on their NPC sheets): NPC <b>Physical Harm</b>, <b>Mental Harm</b>, <b>Trust &amp; Distrust</b>, <b>Leverage</b> and <b>Secrets</b>. <br/>GMs also track <b>Situational</b> factors, with their memory or a sheet of scratch paper; as well as NPC sheets, which have things like NPC <b>Motives</b> and <b>Goals</b>, <b>Relationship to PCs</b>, a <b>Notes </b> section, etc. Finally, the GM has a relationship map that charts the different webs of relationships in regards to PCs and NPCs.<br/>I have not explained how any of the other parts of the game work so you are missing a lot of context. If you have any questions please ask.  As you can see there are a lot of moving parts. My goal is to simplify and make the system more elegant, cut down any interruptions in the fiction, and make things easier for the GM to manage.  Thank you for your help.

I think constantly updating them to reflect temporary factors would be really hard, but noting ongoing or permanent things seems manageable to me.  I'd put those on the relationship map itself.<br/><br/>- If a player's character has leverage over an NPC, or that NPC trusts them, and these things are actually useful to the PC, the player is probably not going to forget them.  If they were tracked numerically, then that number would need to go somewhere, but if it's just conferring Advantage, then "write it down if you want, players" has you covered.  This is my takeaway from many sessions of asking players in Delve to write down which powerful people like them how much.

Each slot is for an NPC role, meaning, a very broad type of relationship you have with an NPC.  You then take the 4 most important NPCs to your character and slot them in where they fit best.  Below each one is listed factors relevant to that role.  Maybe that's leverage, trust, and perceived motives for each, or maybe it's more tailored per role -- I'm not sure.<br/><br/>So, anyone who makes it into your Top 4 NPCs is documented in some detail, and these details are updated by the player whenever relevant.  When a 5th NPC rises in importance to knock someone out of the Top 4, the evicted NPC is deprioritized in all ways, including spotlight and accounting.  We won't expect to see them as much, and we won't be so careful to remember exactly where they stand in relation to everyone else -- close enough is close enough.<br/><br/>This system of replacement is completely unnecessary if the whole game is pre-structured around a tightly-knit cast; in that case, the main point of my brainstorm would be that the Role label contributes to that structure.  For example, if the four slots on the sheet are labeled Dependent, Benefactor, Nemesis, Idol, then we know this character's relationships are about a combo of need and intense personal like/dislike.  This could be true for all PCs, or this could be a sort of chosen PC type or playbook.  Maybe I've got Dependent, Benefactor, Nemesis, and Idol, while you've got Co-Conspirator, Secret Lover, Unworthy Heir, and Victim.  Or maybe the 4 roles could be roles the PC actively seeks to fulfill for their own aims, like Patron, Guardian, Ambassador and Lackey.<br/><br/>Tracking Leverage over your Patron or Trust with your Secret Lover seems worthwhile to me in a way that tracking those same things with every NPC might not be.  Maybe each role could even get away with defining one core element to the relationship that role describes -- when it comes to your Guardian we care about Loyalty, when it comes to your Benefactor we care about Favor, when it comes to your Nemesis we care about Perceived Advantage, etc.<br/><br/>If the game isn't pre-structured, "I want to make that guy my Patron!" or "I want that guy for a Co-Conspirator!" would totally be a thing, and there could be rules about how you establish those relationships, or fail to.<br/><br/>I like this idea!  I dunno whether it belongs here, though.  I can put it in its own thread if that's more appropriate.

If your game depends on the tracking of minutiae, then you would benefit from designing as much of that minutia as <i>factors which help the players</i>. In other words, whenever possible, things that are tracked are almost always advantages for the PCs, never penalties or obstacles. <br/><br/>That "magically" shifts the onus of tracking and noting the details of play off the GM and onto the players. <br/><br/>I think it's a solid design principle to refer to during the design process.

Just to explain a  little bit more how the game works. Nothing is tracked with hit points or numerically.  Everything is tracked fictionally,  with a fictional description.  Situational elements, physical harm, mental harm, social harm, leverage, trust and distrust, are all handled in similar ways.  They all have three lines under there heading. These three lines can have  descriptors  written on them.  These are the ongoing and permanent conditions and or conditions and injuries.  For example, under physical harm, written on one line, might be: "broken arm". All these ongoing or  permanent conditions, as well as temporary ones, effect the fiction, if applicable. For example, in the above example the PC would be unable to fight  with their broken sword hand, and we have to fight with their offhand and which would affect the fiction.  Additionally, all of these ongoing or permanent conditions are given advantages and disadvantages by the GM if they are  applicable to the situation.  This happens every time dice are rolled to resolve conflict and the GM makes a judgment about what type of disadvantage or advantage is applied given the context of the fiction and how it relates  to the condition or injury.  Again, this happens for all categories of things above. So the GM chooses to give either bonus or penalty of minus one or plus one if the advantage or disadvantage is  what is called: noteworthy. The GM chooses to give you their bonus or penalty of -2 or +2 if the advantage or disadvantage is what is called: major. The GM does this for all the categories of that stuff above on the fly and gives every bonus or penalty according to the fictional context and its relation to the narrative. <br/>I can get into the mechanics of how PCs get these conditions or injuries  if you want, as well as any other aspects of the game or rules later on.  Also, I can get into the process of how the GM tracks all the stuff on paper. Hopefully this makes sense, I can going to more detail when I have more time. Answer questions, and go into other aspects of the game if you want.  I will make sure to read your comments as well. Sorry I'm in such a hurry. I will have more time in a couple hours. Thank you again so much for your help.

Each slot is for an NPC role, meaning, a very broad type of relationship you have with an NPC.  You then take the 4 most important NPCs to your character and slot them in where they fit best.  Below each one is listed factors relevant to that role.  Maybe that's leverage, trust, and perceived motives for each, or maybe it's more tailored per role -- I'm not sure.<br/><br/>So, anyone who makes it into your Top 4 NPCs is documented in some detail, and these details are updated by the player whenever relevant.  When a 5th NPC rises in importance to knock someone out of the Top 4, the evicted NPC is deprioritized in all ways, including spotlight and accounting.  We won't expect to see them as much, and we won't be so careful to remember exactly where they stand in relation to everyone else -- close enough is close enough...<br/><br/>...If the game isn't pre-structured, "I want to make that guy my Patron!" or "I want that guy for a Co-Conspirator!" would totally be a thing, and there could be rules about how you establish those relationships, or failure.</blockquote>\nYou're a genius, David. The things above will work really well with my game. This will cut down on what the GM has track a lot. For example, the GM would only have to track the Situational factors and the NPC's Secrets, and NPC health (which works like health in PbtA games; these could be on a very simplified version of the relationship map (which would only need a Notes section, Motives and Goals, and these would already be filled in along with the Secrets). Basically, in game the GM would only have to pay attention to Situtional factors and chose the type of bonuses or penalties that the narrative demands. I also think I'm going to drop Character Traits being that they don't add a lot and their economy is too cumbersome. Thank you so much! This really solves a lot!  You're awesome <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>My first thought at the moment is that, rather than trying to successfully <i>model</i> all the elements that take place in an "intrigue-type interaction", you might get more bang-for-your-buck by aiming to produce processes which <i>create</i> those interactions at the table.</blockquote>\nThis is a really good point, Paul. What do you guys think about this? I've been kicking this idea around anyways.<br/>Many aspects of my game work like PbtA games. For example, the outcomes of rolls work exactly the same way; (albeit there are never lists to reference) the GM makes the results up based entirely upon the fictional context (which is how it works most of the time in PbtA games anyway). Also, the GM keeps things always going forward like in PbtA games, also the fiction goes back and forth from the PCs to the GM and then from the PCs to GM on and on in the same way. Finally, the princables and moves the GM makes are similar (although not called moves). My game does not currently have PC moves, it has another system, but I have been thinking about adding them. Paul said: "you might get more bang-for-your-buck by aiming to produce processes which <i>create</i> those interactions at the table." Paul, that is a great point and something I have really been thinking about. Do you guys think that adding "Moves" in the PbtA games fashion would accomplish this.

I'm not sure if the bonuses or penalties are worth it either. Rolls are only done in situations in which there is a lot of conflict (basically roll are made in the exact same circumstances in which they are made in PbtA games). Maybe given the additional info that I've added about the game you can give me your take. It might be something to be determined with play testing.

Everyone is focused on a clear "target".<br/><br/>You can do the same with Traits or Assets or whatever else.<br/><br/>Not the *best* example, but a decent one:<br/><br/>AW's "seduce/manipulate" move asks you, "What leverage do you have on this person?"<br/><br/>There's no need to track matters beforehand - when you engage the move, that's when we ask each other the question.

I haven't playtested any of that stuff I brainstormed, so I have no idea if it'll actually work, but my fingers are crossed!\n<blockquote>Many aspects of my game work like PbtA games. For example, the outcomes of rolls work exactly the same way; (albeit there are never lists to reference) . . . My game does not currently have PC moves, it has another system, but I have been thinking about adding them. Paul said: "you might get more bang-for-your-buck by aiming to produce processes which <i>create</i> those interactions at the table." . . . Do you guys think that adding "Moves" in the PbtA games fashion would accomplish this?</blockquote>\n<b>Short answer:</b>  No.<br/><br/><b>Longer answer:</b>  If your current system is clear on when a rule is invoked, and clear on what the players do when that happens, and clear on what the outputs of that process mean and how they matter, then switching to "moves" is just details.  If you like the way PbtA games phrase the move triggers ("when you ___"), use that!  If you like the way PbtA games offer the GM outcome guidance with lists, use that!  If you don't, then don't!<br/><br/>Now, if your current system is <i>not</i> clear on when and how and why to use the rules, then I would recommend that you address that in some fashion.  If you like the way PbtA handles it, then that's a fine option.<br/><br/>Nothing about the PbtA format will create "intrigue-type interactions" by itself, though.  PbtA is really just a way to structure a conversation, and not specific to conversations about/within intrigue.  Whether you use PbtA format or not, the intrigue content will be up to you.  So, again, if you're inspired to write intrigue moves by the way PbtA games phrase the move triggers ("when you ___"), use that!  If you're inspired to write intrigue outcomes by the way PbtA games offer the GM outcome guidance with lists, use that!  If you don't, then don't!<br/><br/>Personally, I would take Paul's suggestion about "aiming to produce processes which create intrigue-type interactions at the table" as an impetus to brainstorm rules and/or fictional set-ups that funnel play toward intrigue options and away from non-intrigue options.  "When you meet in secret, save vs discovery" and "when discovered, roll to see which Rival knows" and "you get -2 to all rolls against a Rival who has discovered any of your secrets" or something.\n<blockquote>I'm not sure if the bonuses or penalties are worth it either.</blockquote>Well, you certainly have the option to make every one of them relevant by saying they're all +5 or -5 on 2d6.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I think the question is which factors deserve that (because you actually want them to be that important) vs which factors are subtle details that it'd be nice to factor in but just maybe aren't important enough to bother with.  Prioritize!  Once you've done that, you don't necessarily have to completely ditch the low priorities, but you can maybe model them in a way that sacrifices specificity for convenience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456326/#Comment_456326" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-16T20:55:54+00:00" title="September 16, 2016  8:55PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2016 9:19PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you like the way PbtA games phrase the move triggers ("when you ___"), use that!

I'm amazed at how good your advice is without having access to my full system or the its full context; it's as if you magically understand everything  about my game by some type of weird osmosis. <br/><br/>With the stuff below my intent was exactly to "[aim] to produce processes which create intrigue-type interactions at the table" as Paul suggested. I am going to build that exactly the way you suggest. Earlier today I came up with these ideas to express as move-ish type things (triggered by the fiction) to handle "processes" (just some brain storming, not exhaustive, and defiantly not final):<br/><br/>When you attempt to...<br/>-Conspire with someone <br/>-Rebuild or Gain Someone's trust <br/> -Damage Someone Physically, Psychologically, or Socially   <br/>-Lay a Trap for Someone<br/>-Discover Someone's Motives<br/>-Avoid or escape physical, psychological, or social harm <br/>-Sneak (easesdrop, search someone's room, ect.)<br/>-Gain Leverage on Someone<br/>...Outcomes list<br/><br/>With the stuff above I would have "the move triggers ("when you ___")...[and]  "the GM outcome guidance with lists." Do you think the ideas above fit into the paradigm you suggested? Also, are there any GM outcomes, you would suggest, that you think would be especally useful in creating the intrigue-y aspects I'm after? Or, more "move triggers" you think would apply? If you are comfortable with it I would like to give you credit when I publish my game, because of the great ideas you've suggested and the help you've given to me. I very much do appreciate it. Also, please don't feel like you have to respond or continue to help if you're getting burned out.

Say you have to kill a rival who could expose you. The GM could give a bonus if you were super careful no one observed you and cleaned up really well but you would still have to make a role to see if anyone observed you or you left any clues? I think the best course of development will be to think about how the moves will work together, any unitended consiqueses they might have, and then to test them in game play and make any needed adjustments <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456334/#Comment_456334" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-16T23:31:29+00:00" title="September 16, 2016 11:31PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff,<br/><br/>Sure, I don't mind being credited. I'll give your questions some more thought in the meantime.<br/><br/>By "happen off-screen", I mean that you can have a mechanic for "sneaking around" which you can engage and it skips over the actual action. E.g. "After sneaking around the palace for the last two weeks, here's what you found: ..."<br/><br/>It could be particularly handy if, for instance, the characters employ underlings to do the sneaking for them. (Unless you're creating a game where we follow those underlings explicitly or even take on their roles!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456625/#Comment_456625" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-26T22:18:34+00:00" title="September 26, 2016 10:18PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2016 10:22PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Earlier today I came up with these ideas to express as move-ish type things (triggered by the fiction) to handle "processes" (just some brain storming, not exhaustive, and defiantly not final):<br/><br/>When you attempt to...<br/>-Conspire with someone <br/>-Rebuild or Gain Someone's trust <br/>-Damage Someone Physically, Psychologically, or Socially   <br/>-Lay a Trap for Someone<br/>-Discover Someone's Motives<br/>-Avoid or escape physical, psychological, or social harm <br/>-Sneak (eavesdrop, search someone's room, etc.)<br/>-Gain Leverage on Someone<br/>...Outcomes list<br/><br/>With the stuff above I would have "the move triggers ("when you ___")...[and]  "the GM outcome guidance with lists." Do you think the ideas above fit into the paradigm you suggested?</blockquote>I think they could all be made to!<br/><br/>What did you have in mind with "conspire"?  Like, make a deal?  Go in on a joint venture together?  The main thing at stake, is that whether they accept your proposal?  Or is it more about terms of agreement, whether they price-gouge you or betray you or something?  Depending on where you want to focus, these could be two different moves:<br/>-Make Deal<br/>-Negotiate Terms<br/><br/>I have similar questions for "sneak".  Is this about infiltration?  About doing any covert thing without being detected?  If both, then would two moves be good?\n<blockquote>When you attempt to . . .</blockquote>\nOne note about these moves is that they're all intent and no method.  I think that's nice for clarifying why we care -- "Do I get leverage on this guy or not?" -- but could be awkward for triggering rolls.  Do I roll when I send out feelers for who might have dirt on him?  When I hear that his ex-wife is a possibility, do I roll to find her and arrange a meeting?  Do I roll at the beginning of my chat with her?  At the end?  If my roll fails, does that mean I can't just try again another way?  How do I write an outcome list that suitably covers the drastically different actions I could be undertaking?<br/><br/>Maybe a really good list of GM hard moves would cover it.  So that the GM has a good option for when you fail to ransack the warehouse and a different good option for when you fail to browbeat the ex.  I'm not sure.  Seeing what outcomes and GM hard moves you come up with would give me a clearer sense of things.\n<blockquote>Also, are there any GM outcomes, you would suggest, that you think would be especially useful in creating the intrigue-y aspects I'm after?</blockquote>\nI can think of some things that'd be great to tell the players, and then I can think of some other things that'd be great for the GM to know as the reality.  Part of the fun of intrigue, for me, is not knowing for sure who believes who, and who means what they say.  In RPGs, when NPCs lie to PCs, things often get complicated.  I think a lot of your system particulars will depend on how you want to tackle that.<br/><br/>Anyway, some good GM-facing outcomes:<br/>- NPC believes PC and will proceed cautiously<br/>- NPC believes PC and will commit to that and stake everything on it<br/>- NPC doesn't believe PC and will push back<br/>- NPC doesn't believe PC but will give fake agreement and then pursue ways to screw them<br/>- NPC doesn't believe PC, attempts to hide that (e.g. fake agree), but gives it away<br/>- NPC agrees to deal with intent to follow through, but is unreliable (lacks means, forgets, changes mind, etc.)<br/>\n<blockquote>Or, more "move triggers" you think would apply?</blockquote>I think you've covered the Person A -&gt; Person B scenarios pretty well!  If you wanted, you could also cover situations of personal advancement, like getting a promotion or a title or land or followers.  But maybe that'd all be handled by whatever "Conspire with someone" becomes.<br/><br/>If you leave it all as Person A -&gt; Person B stuff, actually, that'd give you some fun options to make every roll an opposed roll, like this (adapted from <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/766" rel="nofollow">this</a>):\n<blockquote>Roll a die, add your stat + mods.<br/><br/>The GM rolls a die and adds opposition stat + mods.<br/>- If you win by 3 or more, you nail your attempt.<br/>- If you tie or win by 1 or 2, that's basic success.<br/>- If you lose, you fail your attempt, GM makes a hard move.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If you are comfortable with it I would like to give you credit when I publish my game, because of the great ideas you've suggested and the help you've given to me. I very much do appreciate it. Also, please don't feel like you have to respond or continue to help if you're getting burned out.

Credit me in whatever way you feel is appropriate.  As for burning out, I have not lost interest or enthusiasm, but other priorities have superseded this for the last while.  Not sure when I'll have more regular time/energy for this.  Hopefully soon!

class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a><br/>Sorry I didn't have a lot of time to reply to you last time, David. Here are some more thorough answers:\n<blockquote>What did you have in mind with "conspire"?  Like, make a deal?  Go in on a joint venture together?  The main thing at stake, is that whether they accept your proposal?  Or is it more about terms of agreement, whether they price-gouge you or betray you or something?  Depending on where you want to focus, these could be two different moves:<br/>-Make Deal<br/>-Negotiate Terms<br/></blockquote>\nSo, I will be more specific in my discription of this (&amp; the stuff below) in my game, but the idea was for when you conspired with an NPC to act in a harmful, secretive way against another NPC (essentially to plot against them), The outcome of a failed roll (based on a skill called Convince or Espionage or something similar) would be things like being overheard by another NPC, being betrayed by the NPC you are plotting with, ect. Some of the failures in my game are not immediate but create a thing called "Secrets" &amp;/or "Leverage" that are recorded &amp; that NPCs can use against the PCs at a later point in the story, or create complications and misdirection in the drama. Alternatively, a failure could result in an NPC eavesdropper confronting those conspiring in the current scene, etc.  <br/><br/>I say NPC but all this stuff could apply to a PC as could the stuff below. This stuff will be handled via notes, texts, etc., as there are some aspects that PCs have the option of hiding from one another. It isn't a PVP game per say, but sometimes PCs have different relationships with other NPCs &amp; slightly different agendas, and motives but have alliances because they share similar goals. \n<blockquote><br/>I have similar questions for "sneak".  Is this about infiltration?  About doing any covert thing without being detected?  If both, then would two moves be good?<br/></blockquote>\nBasically, this is for situation in which you are trying to gain info on an NPC by sneaking through a dresser drawer in the NPCs room, eavesdropping, ect. Let's say you fail a Steath roll--&amp;, as an aside, their are different degrees of this similar to hard moves &amp; soft moves via PbtA--so you fail your roll while searching the NPCs room; this could result in you accidentally leaving evidence (like a pendant falling off into the drawer unnoticed, again creating a Secret for the NPC to have over the PC or you being observed unknowingly leaving the room, another Secret being created, being confronted etc.\n<blockquote><br/>One note about these moves is that they're all intent and no method.  I think that's nice for clarifying why we care -- "Do I get leverage on this guy or not?" -- but could be awkward for triggering rolls.  Do I roll when I send out feelers for who might have dirt on him?  When I hear that his ex-wife is a possibility, do I roll to find her &amp; arrange a meeting?  Do I roll at the beginning of my chat with her?  At the end?  If my roll fails, does that mean I can't just try again another way?  How do I write an outcome list that suitably covers the drastically different actions I could be undertaking?.</blockquote>\nThis is based on the fictional context (super important) &amp; approach you are taking in a given situation (which are different depending on your archetype and which you are rewarded for taking), the danger and stakes involved, the fiction also determines the appropriate skill, it's a little difficult to sum up here and a lot of examples will be provided in the text to clearify it.\n<blockquote><br/>Maybe a really good list of GM hard moves would cover it.  So that the GM has a good option for when you fail to ransack the warehouse and a different good option for when you fail to browbeat the ex.  I'm not sure.  Seeing what outcomes and GM hard moves you come up with would give me a clearer sense of things.<br/></blockquote>\nThis will defiantly be done and will cover the most typical situations and there will also be room for the GMs personal approaches (by having the option to interpret the fiction and present their own unique complications to PCs via improvised soft and hard moves) once they get the hang of things, and the text will give the GM guildlines and a ton of examples to get them thinking in this direction, and essentially to train them to think this way. They will have room to use whatever creates the best fiction given the context. The GM's responses definitely won't be limited to a list as with some PbtA games, but that will be there as an option.<br/>Also, soft and hard are a little different in my game, not much, but there are some added aspects.\n<blockquote><br/>I can think of some things that'd be great to tell the players, and then I can think of some other things that'd be great for the GM to know as the reality.  Part of the fun of intrigue, for me, is not knowing for sure who believes who, and who means what they say.  In RPGs, when NPCs lie to PCs, things often get complicated.  I think a lot of your system particulars will depend on how you want to tackle that.</blockquote>\nThis will be a big part of it, and I have mechanics I think will accomplish this.\n<blockquote><br/>Anyway, some good GM-facing outcomes:<br/>- NPC believes PC and will proceed cautiously<br/>- NPC believes PC and will commit to that and stake everything on it<br/>- NPC doesn't believe PC and will push back<br/>- NPC doesn't believe PC but will give fake agreement and then pursue ways to screw them<br/>- NPC doesn't believe PC, attempts to hide that (e.g. fake agree), but gives it away<br/>- NPC agrees to deal with intent to follow through, but is unreliable (lacks means, forgets, changes mind, etc.)<br/></blockquote>\nYes, these will be outcomes in the game. The mechanics that these different outcomes are achieved by and selected for are the Trust/Distrust track and the Secrets mechanic (and to some extent the Leverage mechanic), which have been accomplish and simplified in a much more elegant way using a highly modified form of Fate Core mechanics blended with my own.\n<blockquote><br/>If you leave it all as Person A -&gt; Person B stuff, actually, that'd give you some fun options to make every roll an opposed roll, like this (adapted from <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/766" rel="nofollow">this</a>): Roll a die, add your stat + mods.<br/><br/>The GM rolls a die and adds opposition stat + mods.<br/>- If you win by 3 or more, you nail your attempt.<br/>- If you tie or win by 1 or 2, that's basic success.<br/>- If you lose, you fail your attempt, GM makes a hard move.<br/></blockquote>\nOpposed rolls are something I am considering and will depend on the final form the game takes; some of it will depend on the dice mechanic I adopt which will actually be one of the last things I decide on (some of the old dice mechanics got thrown out with the restructuring). I know that it will not be a simple fail/succeed, and will include hard and soft outcomes, so I know what the outcomes will be, just not the particular dice, curve and amount of swing, which will depend on how things shape up and adjustments made during the play testing process. \n<blockquote>Hey man, I'm always psyched when someone else actually finds my contributions useful, and is nice enough to say so!  Credit me in whatever way you feel is appropriate.  As for burning out, I have not lost interest or enthusiasm, but other priorities have superseded this for the last while.  Not sure when I'll have more regular time/energy for this.  Hopefully soon!  It's fun!</blockquote>\nGreat, I think that you and Paul have done a lot of work and contributed a lot to the form of the game in a lot of ways. You always offer a ton of insight! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I very much understand that this takes a lot of energy and I am very thankful for your and Paul's feedback and ideas. I also am very interested in offering feed back in regards to your &amp; Paul_T's games, if desired. Talk to you when things are more developed if you still have the interest and energy.
