I recommend trying them out even if you're all hippy - I know they don't seem like much at first glance, and they might not be roleplaying games (execution depending), but there are some interesting old-yet-forgotten ideas in there. Being the referee is interesting, as your only job in the game is to keep the other players honest and invested in the fiction, without yourself creating any.<br/><br/>What I'd like to see would be a solid, generic Engle Matrix publication that put it all into one book. As it is, the game is scattered into who knows how many products and web pages. Something that dealt with designing your own Engle Matrix scenarios and playing them successfully would serve the game well in reaching new audiences, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173831/#Comment_173831" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T10:31:34+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 10:31AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played an Engle Matrix game on the yahoo group that Chris runs.  I found it a lot of fun and also a bit frustrating.  The frustration came about because our characters were all competing for a goal (to be the next headmaster of a school of evil wizards) and it became hard for me to separate my enjoyment of the fiction we were generating from my enjoyment of my character's success.<br/><br/>Because the referee is necessarily in the role of judging the likeliness (or worthiness) of your argument, it can feel uncomfortable at times - especially on the internet where subtext is impossible to communicate.  So if I make an argument I think is cool or clever, and it's rated low, I'm left wondering why.  And whether I should be building a logical case or writing actions that will delight the referee with their inventiveness.  This was compounded slightly by the fact that, as I recall, Chris stated he would rate some arguments low or high just to create a more interesting story and pace the game correctly.<br/><br/>This aspect made it for me a slightly unhappy case of neither fish nor fowl - a story game with competitive aspects where in theory clever actions will advance your case, but in truth it felt largely up to the referee as to whether I succeed or not (plus the randomness of dice).<br/><br/>That probably overstates the case (and likely is the result of some sour grapes after my character snatched defeat from the jaws of victory) because I really did enjoy the game.  And the simplicity of the mechanism is a delight.  Heck, it even makes for interesting solo play.  So definitely worth a try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173833/#Comment_173833" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T10:35:27+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 10:35AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173876/#Comment_173876" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T12:12:08+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:12PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've also played CEMGs, and Chris' work as had more of an effect on my thinking about design than probably any other guy's.<br/>I also played an experimental version of an EMG, that I think was an off-shoot of the one Flynn played.<br/><br/>What did you want to know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173881/#Comment_173881" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T12:21:15+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:21PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a question - They are heavy on GM fiat, right?

Those were freeform wargames, right?<br/><br/>Sorta. They had a strong GM, and one who would make up mechanics as necessary on the fly. <br/><br/>My understanding is that they were mostly of the " Okay, roll a die:On a 1-2 Thing A happens, on 3-5 Thing B happens, and on a 6 Thing C happens" variety, although other mecchanics might come up, too.<br/><br/>The story I've eard ( true or not) is that Griffith had heard of table top minis gaming but not played any, then attempted to make a game as it most made sense to him based on 3rd hand info.<br/><br/>Which is interesting in the way that is does ( to my mind) look quite a bit like stakes setting.<br/><br/>Take that with a grain of salt, of course, since I've just been arguing with everyone and their brother for a day about tasty flavors of stakes, so...<br/><br/>Anyway, they were certainly low mechanics wargames, akin to the old Free Kreigspiel stuff where you mostly told the ref what you were trying to do, and then they described an outcome based on their experience as former officers.<br/><br/>Have you seen this page?<br/><a href="http://www.wargamedevelopments.org/Wargame%20Developments%20Handbook.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wargamedevelopments.org/Wargame Developments Handbook.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174219/#Comment_174219" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T17:59:26+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  5:59PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that Matrix Games work very well as long as you limit the role of the Ref and make the matrix explicit - exactly what story-telling games do in most cases.

I used that recently with Elliot Wilen, and it is very much like a chromed-up MG. Briefly, the role switches players on a timed basis ( suggested 30 minutes), and the ref acts as a tie-breaker only when the group as a whole can't decide likelihood ( EMG equivalent would be Argument strength).<br/><br/>In what way would you make the matrix explicit <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a> ? I've seen some attempts at that, although I haven't tried them. I could see it being either good or bad.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>( Shoot!
