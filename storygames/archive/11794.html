Any thoughts on the extent to which they're worth using?

It stopped about 6 months ago.  I'm quite interested in VTTs and so far MapTools is far and away the best.  It's free, cross-platform, system independent, fairly easy to use at its base but quite powerful.  It also has active support, both by the creators and fans.  New builds come out quite regularly and people are making all kinds of material for the game system of your choice.<br/><br/>The only tricky technical part (and this is the case for any VTT that is hosted by an individual) is setting up your Port Forwarding properly. If you have a bit of understanding of how your router works at home, this shouldn't be a problem and there is tons of help at the <a href="http://forums.rptools.net/viewforum.php?f=3&amp;sid=c88640c0607c2962152c990171a490d8" rel="nofollow">MapTools forums</a>.<br/><br/>I don't know how up to date there are, but there are several really great <a href="http://rptoolstutorials.net/maptool.htm" rel="nofollow">tutorial videos</a> on MapTools that go through the basics and give a good overview of all the various features.<br/><br/>Let me know if you have any specific questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263512/#Comment_263512" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T16:02:01+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  4:02PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used MapTool a few times and basically agree with everything walkerp says above.

So you can run the latest version on the Mac, but for people used to that interface, it's much better to get the one that starts up properly and has the Mac menus and all that. It isn't a big deal, just a question of making sure you get the right version between all the players and being one or two builds behind is not a dealbreaker.<br/><br/>Maybe they've fixed it and integrated the Mac version into the current release, as the time differences were getting shorter and shorter when I was using it regularily.<br/><br/>Again, I am reminded of what a dynamic and active community that is.  They seem to have good, productive and positive leadership buoyed up by active, productive and positive fans.
