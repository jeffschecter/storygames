I have no idea how what I'm about to say relates to that thread but it was definitely inspired by that thread.  I want to talk about games that require practice.  To some extent ALL games probably take practice.  The degree to which a game already speaks to your past history is probably the degree to which it takes less practice.  Dogs in the Vineyard for example is pretty much everything I ever tried to achieve with the game Chill so I can play that game in my sleep.  There are four games right now in my collection that I look at and instantly feel like they require practice (to me).<br/><br/>Sorcerer<br/>Spione<br/>Dirty Secrets<br/>Capes<br/><br/>Some of you know that I have this project called Sorcerer Unbound which is supposed to be my "How To" manual for Sorcerer.  If you take a look at my hard drive you'll notice about 20 documents with that title and various dates appended on to it.  That's because this project is my Great White Whale and I've tried every approach known to man from a high level theory perspective to a linear step-by-step approach and I'm never happy with it.  About a month or so ago I hit upon the core confounding question of this project, "Why is it so dirt simple to explain Sorcerer in the specifics of actual play, but so fucking hard to explain it in the abstract?"  And like Ron's Band metaphor I hit upon the answer in a musical analogy.<br/><br/>The core Sorcerer book is like the fingering chart for a flute.  It tells you where to put your fingers to play a C note, and A note, etc.  I think to some extent it fails to tell you how to read music but I think that has to do with Ron's target audience.  What it does not tell you how to do is compose music.  So when you come to me with a specific piece of music it's very easy to tell you where to put your fingers, how to transition, whether to blow hard or soft.  But if you come to me and ask me how one composes a piece of music I'm going to look at you rather blankly.<br/><br/>Quite frankly Sorcerer requires a bit of artistry with regard to mastering what is basically this simple process 1) identifying conflicts -&gt; 2) interpreting the outcome of conflicts and -&gt; 3) how to apply victory dice.  Four groups can more or less be faced with the same fictional set of circumstances and apply the rules in four different ways all of which would be "legal" and the differences would largely be to due to where each of the four groups emotional and creative investment was.  This is why trying to translate established fiction into game mechanics is nonsensical.  Quite frankly I can take any piece of completed fiction and come up with four different ways the Sorcerer mechanics could have produced that fiction as output.<br/><br/>Now I'm going to anticipate an objection.  The objection I think I might hear is, "But Jesse, isn't this EXACTLY what we were trying to get away from?  Rules that require GM/Player fiat to get working?  If you can apply the Sorcerer rules in multiple ways to the same situation then aren't we just back to Rule 0/The Golden Rule?"<br/><br/>NO.<br/><br/>There is vast difference between Rule 0/The Golden Rule and a self-consistent rule base that still requires artistry to apply.  Rule 0 actually undercuts what could otherwise be a rather functional social dynamic.  Most people I talk to agree that I don't need rules to defend myself from dick weed players.  I have a front door, a lock and an invitation to leave to defend myself from dick weed players.  I'm assuming a socially and creatively synergistic group of people as given.  When you take that for granted you realize that stuff like the IIEE parts of Forge theory are actually WAY more important than Creative Agenda.<br/><br/>So if you HAVE a socially and creatively synergistic group what do rules matter?  Such is the core criticism of System Does Matter.  However, some how that wonderfully functional social and creative synergy has to be given form and function and that's what games of any sort do.  What Rule 0 does is undercut the form and function.  The game says here is the process and structure of play up until someone (usually the GM) says it isn't.  At best this undercuts any value of having any kind of organization at all, and at worst it opens the group up to even well meaning power plays for creative recognition.<br/><br/>Compare that to say Maneuvers in Spione.  During Maneuvers in Spione if it's your turn what you say is, when it's not your turn what you say is a suggestion to the person whose turn it is.  That very simple rule which can be applied consistently without change suddenly cuts out 98% of the problems you get in a game where say three people all shout out what their character is "doing" and someone has to manually organize it all into a coherent sequence before it can be accepted into the fiction.  Add in that the text says the purpose of Maneuvers is to place the principle spies into The Cold (a very specific kind of conflict as explained in the text) and now the creative dialog among our socially and creatively synergistic group has form and function and in play this flows rather smoothly.<br/><br/>Notice however that the content might still be crap.  We might not be very good at putting spies into the cold.  Our turns might still be full of sound and fury signifying nothing.  Even though we have a consistently applicable rule base with no hint of rule 0 we might still suck.  Quality Spione play takes practice.<br/><br/>Sorcerer has more fiddly bits but the principle applies.  Same with Dirty Secrets.  Doubly so for Capes.<br/><br/>Now in some sense I feel like I'm time traveling.  I feel like I'm saying something we all agreed with back in 2002.  But maybe some lessons are worth repeating because I also feel like there's been this over seizing of System Does Matter to the point of System Should Do The Work For You.  Spione does not produce espionage fiction through cold chess like applications of its rules.  Dirty Secrets does not produce quality hardboiled detective fiction through an arms length mechanistic application of its procedures.  What these games do is channel your already in place, pre-play commitment to producing quality espionage or hardboiled detective fiction into a functional group process.  They require emotional engagement and creative and artistic applications of their procedures.  They require passionate play.  They require practice.<br/><br/>I think some of the weaker designs out there try and create rules that either substitute for having a socially and creatively synergistic group OR try to protect you from sucky contributions and thereby trying to guarantee that every game produces a quality experience regardless of the quality of input.  I think some of the weaker TEXTS have wonderfully functional games that fail to tell you key social elements that are required for play.  Spione would be a mess if it didn't explain the concept of The Cold to you.  Dirty Secrets would be a mess if the entire second half of the book didn't exist.<br/><br/>To tie this back to Christopher's post I think what he was suggesting is that we as designers would have a lot to learn by practicing our existing games until we are good of them.  Had a bad time the first time you played Capes?  Re-read the book, read AP posts, go back try again.  Just cause you can't play a symphony the first time you take the flute out of the box doesn't mean the instrument is broken.<br/><br/>Play Sorcerer until you are good at it.<br/><br/>Play Spione until you are good at it.<br/><br/>Play Dirty Secrets until you are good at it.<br/><br/>Play Capes until you are good at it.<br/><br/>Play any game you think takes practice until you are good at it.<br/><br/>Then take what you've learned and design from there.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128234/#Comment_128234" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T19:21:52+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  7:21PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 7:22PM by Ry.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Jesse, you are so, so right.<br/><br/>My only comment is that you need to have players and GM who all know the rules before you can start thinking about how well you're applying them.

I've played Dirty Secrets and Spione twice each and both games were fun and awesome but... I want to be better.  I want my Spione games to be more coherent.  I want my Dirty Secrets games to have a little more "action" in them.<br/><br/>Action isn't quite the right word.  So one of the best pieces of advice in the book is that players should have a working theory of the case and just play to that.  One of the skills to master when playing Dirty Secrets is to learn how to act without motivation and speculate on motivation in retrospect.  I notice players hesitate to really seize a character and have them do something proactive because they don't know what the character is up to.  The skill to cultivate is to learn how to just decide in the short term what you *think* the character is up to, play to that with gusto, but still be willing to revise what you think if another player takes what you did in another direction.<br/><br/>So far my Dirty Secrets games haven't had a lot of motion.  They almost feel like point-n-click adventure games where you always find the same characters in the same set pieces and all that's changed is the dialog options that have opened up since the investigator was last here.  Which sometimes hardboiled detective novels look like but they aren't.  Characters move around and do stuff while the investigator isn't looking and then the investigator stumbles into the consequences.  I want more of that in my Dirty Secrets play.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128275/#Comment_128275" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T21:23:50+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  9:23PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about games that beg fine tuning?

This.<br/><br/>And, not surprisingly, this was one of my principles when designing <i>Dirty Secrets</i>.  I'm perfectly willing to hand you the tools, but the game won't do the actual playing for you.  On the other hand, the Handbook portion of the game is my attempt to communicate what "good play" looks like in <i>Dirty Secrets</i>.  That way, you don't have to start from square one when trying to figure out what to do with this game.<br/><br/>And, while I'm here, this is one of my beefs with the Eurogames crowd.  Increasingly, it seems like there's an unwillingness to spend time with a game, to try to learn the subtle intricacies and nuances of a game, to tease out the delicate possibilities that reveal themselves.  So, it's something that I try to combat in myself and others in that arena, and one that I'd like to poke at in this neck of the woods, too.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128334/#Comment_128334" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T22:55:02+00:00" title="February 20, 2008 10:55PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 10:56PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Jesse.<br/><br/>(And count me among the people waiting for Sorcerer Unbound, also understanding that Great White Whales come along in their own time)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128398/#Comment_128398" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T06:36:12+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  6:36AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>But maybe some lessons are worth repeating because I also feel like there's been this over seizing of System Does Matter to the point of System Should Do The Work For You.</blockquote>\nFuck.

I have always considered Sorcerer as a point of reference in this respect. Not only do you need to practice playing it to get better, but playing it also helps train you to become a more confident practitioner with regards to conflict resolution and a couple of other prominent features of the game. I wonder if Trollbabe shouldn't be mentioned alongside Sorcerer actually. I think it should.<br/><br/>Spione worked for me the first (and only) time I played it, Dirty Secrets also but not entirely for the other players. Those three games (+ TB) I am willing to play any time, anywhere.<br/><br/>Capes. I have a confession to make. I couldn't make any sense of it by reading the book whatsoever.

We got some great scenes, but for me the ending fell flat and I thought the game left us pretty unsupported at the end, it didn't deliver a necessarily dramatic ending the way say My Life with Master does.  I also thought the conflict mechanic was a bit uninteresting and felt unconnected to the actual play (unlike say Dogs, where what you do mechanically is plainly linked to what happens in game).<br/><br/>Basically, I didn't think it was a very good game.  The session was overall fun, but that was the other players really, the system I thought brought very little to the party.  <br/><br/>Rationally, given I have given it a go and thought the system lacking, and given many other systems do work for me and many systems I haven't got to give a go to yet at all, why would I keep practicising?<br/><br/>How do I know which games to keep practising with?  How long for?  If I spend three months playing Spione and I still think it mechanically lacking in fairly fundamental ways, should I plug on?  That's three months of not so fun gaming already.  If I do that for Spione, why not for the new Spacemaster game that's come out that I didn't like either when I played that at a different con?<br/><br/>There are so many great games, why would it make sense to take some leap of faith that a game I have tried and found wanting will turn out great if I keep trying?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129880/#Comment_129880" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T18:49:35+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  6:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 6:53PM by spookyfanboy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Balbinus: Hopefully, that's where author feedback comes in.

Or that every game becomes better with practice. That's non-controversial. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think that a game that requires practice to be fun is not a good design. Since so many games are fun right out of the box. Oh, I could imagine a game that marketed itself as "advanced" and gave you exercises to ramp up to where you need to be to play it or something. But the expectation is, quite rightly, that the game should work pretty well in the first session of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf "System Matters" then it should do what it claims to. Just as D&amp;D produces reasonably fun gamism the first time you try it. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, let's take Sorcerer. I think that it's not hard. Of course, this will vary for different people. I'm probably like Ron in enough ways that it was a pretty easy game for me to pick up and get into (my recent cricisms of it aside). It meets my criteria, therefore, because it does what it claims to very well, right out of the gate. No practice needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you needed practice to become good at it... well not all games are created equal for all players. It may have required some practice and advice to get it to work for you. But that's not the same as saying that this is true for all. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo this extent, I'd go so far as to say that it's going to be very hard to generalize games that require more work to become expert with than those that do not. For instance, I had no trouble at all with Rolemaster, being a math geek and all. Others find it incredibly hard to deal with because of their distaste for all of the math, and probably had to work very hard to get it to be as functional as it could be for them. On the other hand, there have been systems that others have taken to like ducks to water, that I have had to struggle with. This is going to be a very individual thing, I think. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130274/#Comment_130274" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T12:32:23+00:00" title="February 25, 2008 12:32PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>But I think that a game that requires practice to be fun is not a good design. <br/></blockquote>\nThat's a hefty generalisation there, Mike, just think of chess or go, or any sport that's requires some minimum level of skill, say, fx. golf.

But with this caveat: I'm not saying that that the first or second session of these games are no-fun or totally suck.  I'm saying that for the game to give out its maximum payout takes a few sessions.<br/><br/>Sorcerer.  This is a big one.  The first session of a Sorcerer game can be rough on a GM if you're not expecting it.  You will walk away feeling like a totally failure because "nothing happened."  You will find many posts on The Forge about this first session Sorcerer GM malaise.  However, if you talk to the players you will find that they are usually pretty jazzed about the *potential* energy that first session created.  They have ideas percolating about where they want to go with the material.  And if you just trust that and use that potential energy you'll find that by session three the game will kick into high gear.  The Humanity issues need to boil a bit before they really start coming into play in full force.<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures - A single session gives you a taste.  Playing out a full 5 episode season arc pays out in amazing ways.  When people know just how many episodes away their Spotlight Episode is and where it falls in relation to everyone else's Spotlight Episode they play to it and creates a very specific multi-session creative dynamic.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard - This one is kind of cheat since a single town can start the awesome factor pretty high.  Let me just say that the fifth town in a campaign is that awesome squared.<br/><br/>Trollbabe - Similar to Dogs in the Vineyard in that it has a deceptively fun and engaging single session unit of play but it's designed to have a cumulative multi-session world spanning Epic scope over the long run that you don't see in the single unit.<br/><br/>My Life with Master - The frantic chaos of a single session game just doesn't have the kind of heart breaking emotional payoff that a slower boil multi-session game does.<br/><br/>Note: I argue that all my examples above are fundamentally different then say, just the accumulated experiences of playing ANY game for more than a single session.  That the games are fundamentally different experiences, by design, over the long haul as opposed to just relying on the natural emotional continuity of the players.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130292/#Comment_130292" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T13:18:37+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  1:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've heard that Vincent said that Dogs play doesn't really hit the really big awesome until the third or fourth session.  <br/><br/>Wicked Age's owe list requires at least a couple of sessions in order to drive behavior (otherwise you have to be on the honor system)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130295/#Comment_130295" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T13:28:13+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  1:28PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you're talking about games that get better with multi session play as apposed to games that are not fun unless you play several sessions.

Applied many many times this really begins to tighten down the thumb screws on what the Dogs really believe.  Eventually you hit a town that definitely feels like a bursting tension bubble where the players give you their definitive answer (relative to their characters) on whatever you've been honing in on.  In my Dogs campaign that turned out to be the problematic nature of adolescents turning into adults with new ideas into a community based on unquestioned traditions.  It took us 5 towns to get there.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130371/#Comment_130371" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T20:01:13+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  8:01PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Yes, this.

That's why we playtest: to catch bad assumptions and adjust the text (and sometimes the procedures) to prevent them.  Repeat this through enough iterations, and eventually each new game plays without bad assumptions hampering play.<br/><br/>Can you prevent every single mistake that could ever possibly be made?  Of course not -- but you can make sure that, when the players read the book to find out what went wrong, they find an answer and fix the problem.<br/><br/>Jesse, I really don't see how a game text that allows bad assumptions to be made uncorrected is anything other than a bad game text.<br/><br/>But that's my only problem with your "games that require practice" thing.

What's a game that doesn't require practice?</blockquote>\nAs I said in the original post I assume all games require practice to one degree or another.  I pointed out Dogs in the Vineyard as a game that doesn't require very much practice for me because it's inline with a lot of my role-playing history, namely a combination of old habits from Chill and new habits from Sorcerer.  I think the big things that I had to learn about Dogs in the Vineyard was a) Give when I cease to care and b) Give when there's no chance of delivering fallout.<br/><br/>But there are certain games that allow more and more content freedom while still offering important and key structural components.  Spione is about the most extreme example of this I've ever seen.  I'm really quite taken with it because it looks like it does nothing but it does but in a weird kind of side ways behind your back while you're not looking kind of way.  I find these games require more awareness of the game and what you can do with it and and exactly how the system touches the narrative to work properly to really make it sing.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130386/#Comment_130386" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T21:32:58+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  9:32PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Part of my frustration with Sorcerer Unbound is that every line I've ever written, I've actually managed to find the corresponding line in the Sorcerer core text where it actually says the thing I thought I wasn't there.

Avoiding the unconscious assumptions you, and I humbly presume a horde of other folk, bring to Sorcerer. Just because its hidden somewhere in the book doesn't mean it is accessible to the average player and doesn't mean that a guidebook to the right path wouldn't be appreciated.<br/><br/>I can't comment directly on Sorcerer cuz I just bought the thing and haven't gotten to read it yet, but for my $0.02 authors should always do there best to identify their likely audience and to address erroneous assumptions those readers are likely to make. Its lazy to say, well I didn't write my book with the reader in mind, or to pass off one reader's experience as idiosyncratic, when others have similar responses. At least you should try to fix the low hanging fruit.

At 7 I think. My son was 5, and had fun. Frustrated, sure. But that's not the same as the game being mystifying. Easy to learn, difficult to master. Yes, this is the mantra that you'll find extoled a thousand times a thousand times at boardgamegeek.com. We're talking threshold differences here. All I was saying is that the first session or two should be understandable and enjoyable. Put another way, they should not suck. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith your statement that the first and second sessions will not suck, we're in complete agreement then, Jesse. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I think that there's a slightly different phenomenon that might be going on here at times. That is, it's not so much "practice" as that the game is designed to take that long to play out. People miss out on all of the emergent properties of Inspectres simply because the mechanics don't come into play if you only play one session of it. Has nothing to do with practice, but playing the game out to the extent where it was designed to deliver it's maximum impact. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not to say that the practice phenomenon isn't there, too. Just that with Sorcerer, I felt the same thing you did, but for me it was just getting to know my character and his demons, etc. Just a quality of multi-session Sorcerer play that I think occurs regardless of player skill with the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Fortunately, James, Ron would never say that. What he says is that if you read the text, but do something other than what the text says to do, then it's not his fault. We're talking literally here. A lot of people who come to play Sorcerer bringing in old-school expectations actually do things that are not indicated by the rules. Where people are playing by the rules he provides, and still having problems, he digs deeper with them to find the problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this is all despite the fact that, indeed, he's never claimed that the audience for Sorcerer was "every gamer." Does he need to caveat his game by putting a disclaimer on the front like, "This game may not be for everyone!"<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn't that true of absolutely every RPG? <br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest you get the book and read it. It's really not very odd. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130496/#Comment_130496" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T08:36:43+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  8:36AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion is really good.

Part of it has to do with the gamist angle of D&amp;D, or the "game as game" and how there is a reward in any situation like that to mastering the system, to learning how things really work, and to gaining a competence with complex systems that allows you to address higher complexity challenges. <br/><br/>Now, BW doesn't do the same thing, but I think its "needs practice" is closer to D&amp;D rules mastery. It is really about internalizing a complex but well described process than it is about having to undo expectations or gain artful means. <br/><br/>If any part of BW fits that, I'd say its getting the BiTs to work on full churn mode. A lot of the stuff I've had to gain "artful means" for with BW was around beliefes and situations. Its worth noting that I wrote in pencil in the margins of the book Thor's dictum about "a belief is something you can accomplish to earn a persona point" and so on. Also, the situation generators in Blossoms Falling went a long way to removing a certain level of artful means that may have been needed for the core book. <br/><br/>(Also worth noting, Burning Empires directly and unequivocally addressed both of these points.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130564/#Comment_130564" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T11:38:58+00:00" title="February 26, 2008 11:38AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, and, of course, learning the Rock-Paper-Sciscors mechanics that are the various combat maneuvers for BW/BE. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, uh, yeah, that's part of the fun of any gamism, right, learning how to get good at it?

That is the rules in games that promote narrativism aren't some challenging minefield through which to be maneuvered. The rules in gamism facilitate challenge. The rules in a game meant to promote narrativism should make it relatively easy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe challenge with narrativism is in coming up with the most entertaining themes we can given the tools present. The tools should facilitate this. Just as good gamism rules should facilitate the creation of player challenge. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is not to say that I'm against challenging narrativism games, either. Simply that the rules, and using them effectively, should not be wherein the challenge lay. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph and I used to get all astounded at what we found to be a "learning curve" for Universalis. And others note it too, when playing - they figure out the emergent techniques as they play. But what's interesting is that, in fact, this "curve" is pretty quick. Most people have come up with a lot of techniques by the end of their first session. What did we, or others, expect? Instant understanding of every possible technique that could come out of what is a game that has a lot of emergent qualities? <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean we could have written about our discoveries in the book, but we felt that it was better to let people discover these properties on their own. Because we could have written forever - there are potentially infinite numbers of possible techniques that could emerge. <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead we wrote the game that we felt people could have fun with just understanding what we'd written, and they'd learn everything they needed to know about it quick enough. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are RPGs, and even in a complex wargame, you can't explain all of the emergent properties of play. In RPGs it's ten times worse, as the precise subjects of play are so potentially diverse, even in the most limited of games. So you have to give the basic tools that people need, and let them go off and discover the play on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this takes time...practice if you will. But that path of discovery is what RPGs are all about. This is just exploration of system we're talking about here. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130587/#Comment_130587" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T12:53:46+00:00" title="February 26, 2008 12:53PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>Which is not to say that I'm against challenging narrativism games, either.

It may be easiest (i.e., the path of least resistance) to create a game supportive of a narrativist agenda if you only focus on narrativist supporting features and minimize any mechanisms that can be gamed. I think Trollbabe is a brilliant game that illustrates this type of design nicely.<br/><br/>But there are many excellent games with plenty of narrativist support that do not do it. They have many points of contact with a high degree of game-y mechanical interaction. Cases in point: Sorcerer, Dogs in the Vineyard, With Great Power, Nine Worlds, My Life with Master. I'll be vain and include Burning Empires in that list. There are many others.<br/><br/>These are games that do not shy from the idea that using rules effectively is part of the challenge of play, and specifically narrativist-oriented play.<br/><br/>I would put forward that it is more difficult to design games like these. Complicated games are difficult to design, period. There are more potential points of failure. There is more potential for narrativist-supporting games with heavy, duty mechanical interaction to go wrong. (Games with simple mechanical interactions are very challenging to design in a completely different way.)<br/><br/>And yet, that's part of what makes them interesting challenges to design. Right now, Paul is working on a game in which you are intended to empathize with the victims of your character and protagonize them rather than the character you play. That's a tall order! It's really difficult (and maybe it's impossible). That challenge is partly what intrigues Paul--mad scientist that he is--about the project. It also happens to be a mechanically intense game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130816/#Comment_130816" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T08:29:47+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  8:29AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2008 8:31AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following the above post...<br/>\n<br/>\nThor, you're right, but let me explain it like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two levels to play. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Understanding the Rules<br/>\n - Understanding how best to use the Rules<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning the rules of chess is dead easy. The "practice" comes in mastering the emergent complexities. The same is true with good gamism RPGs. Game sessions "suck" often because we simply don't understand the procedures of play. We expect to have no trouble with this part. <br/>\n<br/>\nNarrativism is the same, you are right. In that it's only problematic if we're not sure what we're supposed to be doing, and play falls apart as an activity. Understanding how best to use the rules, mastery of them in terms of creating theme, should be challenging, yes. We should be applauded for showing how well we do it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is that in Gamism, the rules themselves often exist on both levels. That is, it's not just emergent properties, but the basic properties of the rules that we have to understand in order to excel at playing in a gamism mode. Does this feat work well in conjunction with this other feat? The rules themselves serve as the test. And it's a gamism test. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn narrativism, once you've got a hold of the rules, and you're creating theme, it's largely on the player to come up with a theme that's entertaining to the group. The ability rewarded is not in manipluating the rules in some clever way in order to create the theme, but simply in how well they construct it from what they control in the SIS. I'd posit that a narrativism game creates this challenge by, say, the situation or characters. I can't think of a single game that attempts to do this by system. I tend to think that, if you did, it would cause the game to tend to promote gamism. <br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes feel this way about MLWM. Even though it's very simple to use. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny better? <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying that mastery should neccessarily come easy (though some people like that). I'm saying that the rules in a narrativism promoting game will tend not to provide that challenge in a mechanical way, so much as in a creative way. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n(Edited to note crosspost with Thor)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130818/#Comment_130818" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T08:37:19+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  8:37AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2008 8:37AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following up in reply to Thor.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor AoE of BE, I'd say that the skill of manipulating those rules in order to create theme, while laudible, is not theme itself. You can be very skilled at scene framing, and still create a garbage theme (or, more likely, none at all).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, I'd say that these rules are precisely part of Understanding the Rules as a tool that should be as "easy" as possible. Note that, if you have a powerful tool, it's going to be harder. But may well be worthwhile. I think of BE like that.

Difficulty is good for difficulty's sake? Doesn't it have to pertain to the creative agenda in some way, proving you've met the challenge?</blockquote>\nHonestly, I don't know. I'm really happy with the game as is. <br/><br/>It's supposed to be a challenging game to play. Making thematic decisions is the primary goal: The center of play is the constant struggle between fighting for what you believe and sacrificing that belief for the greater good. When you have to choose between having it out with someone over what you believe (conflict scene) or walking away to allow another player to have a conflict scene that advances humanity's efforts against the Vaylen, you are engaging in the thematic struggle by confronting a limitation placed in your way by the mechanics.<br/><br/>So the challenge presented by effective use of the rules are a major element in driving thematic play in the game. In turn, it makes those moments when you choose to play non-optimally in order to pursue what your character believes really potent. Now, it can make the rules <i>look</i> like they support a gamist agenda. But I don't think the game would be very satisfying played in that way. There isn't quite enough game outside the context of the thematic struggle to make it really satisfying in that mode.<br/><br/>As far as My Life with Master goes, in some ways it is a game that supports a narrativist agenda but without guardrails. In other words, there's nothing to prevent you from approaching the game without a narrativist agenda. You can play it to win and without caring about the Innocents. But it won't be a very satisfying experience. The same is true of Dogs in the Vineyard. You can play the game to shoot the crap out of people without caring about any of the NPCs or their problems, but it will be a dissatisfying experience. On the other hand, if you DO care about the NPCs and want them to overcome their problems, if you DO accept them as friends and family, the game provides a very different and much more interesting experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div
