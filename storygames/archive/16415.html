I thought for this one, we could do kind of a group excercise.<br/><br/>For this one, I want you to think about what kind of minis world/playset collection you'd like to put together, to form the physical part of a game.<br/><br/>Very often the costs associated with minis use can be intimidating. So can the thought of building/painting stuf, or even just trying to find the right kind of stuff to use in the first place.<br/><br/>After all, outside of the stuff you find on the shelves of the FLGS, very often you'll have to go searching for the right kind of thing for you and your interests.<br/><br/>This thread is for interested parties to post about a kind of world playset they'd put together if they could.<br/><br/>What do I mean by "world playset"? Just really the cllection of mini people and critters and the toy landscape and vehicles. You'll want a general idea of general use stuff, stuff that can be re-used but also re-arranged and recombined. You don't necessarily want super specific to start with.<br/><br/>What I want you to do is go ahead and post something, give a quick description, and maybe a couple of adventure ideas or vignettes/snippets of action or interaction. Then the other thread participants will help track down links and give suggestions on how you might do something like that with resources they already know about, or give suggestions on related stuff you might not know a lot about that would help you build that kind of thing.<br/><br/>I will ask that no one participating go out of their way to break the spirit of the discussion. Please nothing that goes wildly, wildly out of reasonable human working budgets. No gold plated figures from a zar's tomb or something. Also, let's be reasonable with some of the initial suggestions of world playsets and collection concepts, shooting for stuff that we know could reasonably exist before we get real out there and super-weird.<br/><br/>If you don't have a particular set in mind, I'll give a starter excercise. A while back, Sam! was asking about a John Carter-ish setting. Take that one and run with it folks. What would he want/need to start off that kind of world playset for an JC inspired game setting?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375062/#Comment_375062" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T07:28:55+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  7:28AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 7:31AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm building an Iraq war tabletop/mini hybrid thing called Task Force Roach.

It all depends on what kind of stories you are interested in.<br/><br/>I could see Jason's TF Roach as having a lot of interest with civilians if he wanted to take it that way. In fact the civilians are the most important in a counter-insurgency campaign cos they are the prize. <br/><br/>In 15mm (Which I like for tactical games - it gives the big event feels without taking up a lot of space) I have a bunch of generic civilians. I could really do with some characters to add to this. I have various news reporters/TV camera men etc but some fem fatals, Peter Lorries, Sam Sapde types would do well. They bring in the intrigue and romance elements. When it is just combatants - well - all they do is shoot one another. BORING!<br/><br/>A lot of my figures are Middle Eastern types. They bring an air of exotic to the table and work well in Sci Fi games. I see a lot more potential in SF for stories than modern because you can do anything with them. Star Trek guys encounter every kind of people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375424/#Comment_375424" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T07:07:25+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  7:07AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a nifty pic Jason. Very much in line with the kinds of playset physical materials old HG Wells was using with his boys and adult pals.<br/><br/>Even without getting into non-mililtary small unti action stuff, what about just plain stuff you might add for landscapes? River beds, hills, maybe some sort of farm or orchard type stuff?<br/><br/>One thing I did see that might really work well for you with that scale of minis is an article about using wood chips like people scatter around their bushes on their lawns to make some really dramatic looking, rocky hills. I'll see if I can find it. IIRC, it's a pretty easy project and cheap too. Combine it with some concepts about making not-to-scale-but functional mountains from the old Major General Tremorden site, and you could have some really nifty country side for long scary patrolling.<br/><br/>BTW, Have you seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094716/" rel="nofollow">The Beast of War (1988)</a>? It might be translatable to a more modern situation that you can use for scenario ideas, while still staying focussed on military actions.<br/><br/>Chris:<br/>I know you've said that you have severa different collections that are essentially world collections. I also know you're an old veteran minis gamer, so there's probably some decent overlap between them ( rocky sandy colored hills could bepart of  Sudan, Afghanistan, The Old West, John Carter's Mars, Tattoine, or withe a bit of foliage on top, even a piratestory island, for example).<br/><br/>As just part of this excersise, could you name off a themed playset that uses a bunch of stuff you already have, and tell us why it went all together in your mind?<br/><br/>You mentioned a more SciFi type setting in passing. Maybe use that for an example idea. Something maybe Traveller-ish or Firefly-ish, where it's SF, but there's still a lot of call backs to near past type clothing and so on ( mostly so you don't need to rebuy eveything). Just tell us what you'd absolutely want to use, what you think you'd want on hand for flexibility ( especially playing a secon or third game in the setting), and what you don't have but you'd want to add to that collection, assuming you had some time and money to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375426/#Comment_375426" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T07:13:04+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  7:13AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 7:22AM by komradebob.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, not on topic, but I thought maybe someone would like to see these new<a href="http://theminiaturespage.com/news/?id=1644409280" rel="nofollow">Steampunk paper tank models</a>.

It is used to fill in cracks in floors. It dries rock hard (that's what the can says and they don' lie). It doesn't shrink when drying. A think coat will add a lot of strength to the piece. <br/><br/>Oh! One thing about terrain bits. They are bulkie as all get out. Build a few generic ones and used them again and again. They are a lot easier to make than to live with.<br/><br/>Humm... Thinking of a play set...<br/><br/>With the 15mm sets I tend to buy whole forces at a time or collect interesting looking buildings or vehicles. So I have space marines, Star Wars like storm troopers, a could of spacefaring aliens, "Alien" movie aliens, greys, zombies, civilians (I'll reuse my stock set), and even modern soldiers if need be. Typically I want to field 20 to 40 stands of guys. For civilian and Horse and Musket era or before I put two figs per stand (I will certainly do this with zombies) for modern and future troops I put one figure per stand. So I'm looking at 40 or so figures (two or three blister packs). Buying a whole force costs around $100 so it isn't cheap but they will last a lifetime. <br/><br/>I like movies like "Ghosts of Mars" "Aliens" and "Star Ship Troopers" for scenarios (Do you want to know more?) Rather than Firefly or Star Wars. I also love the vibe of 1950's Sci Fi. Frequently I come up with scenarios off the cuff just before a con. It grows out of the figures an terrain I have on hand rather than the other way around. So if I see a cool type of figure I buy them. I still haven't painted the zombies or grey aliens but I know I will and when I do I'll use them. <br/><br/>I feel all pontificating here. Kind of fun but silly really. Just gather up a bunch of compatible toys, put them on a table with simple terrain, and start making up what happens.

I tend to stick to some pretty basic stuff myself, just for cost reasons. If I eventually end up with a group of folks doing more minis oriented stuff that isn't motly me, I'll slow down and do some more intricate stuff, but for now that quick-cheap approach works.<br/><br/>I use a lot of paper terrain myself and yeah, spills and crushes are a problem but not too bad of one.<br/><br/>For futuristic cities ( or really a lot of fantasy terrain) I tend to go for the old styrofoam pacakaging from electronics and modify it. I'd say make friends with your stock clerks at the local department store tv/radio department or just hit up your pals. A dark cyberpunk type city could be built with that kind of thing mostly, but stick with "lunar" range colors and only small bits of "solar" colors for detailing and weird lights. If you spend money for  any terrain stuff, think about those hexagon building sets that you find on a few differet minis sites ( they look very industrial/necromunda-ish).<br/><br/>Other things? Hmm. HIt the discount store or thrift stor for cheap plastic shelving units and cut and re-arrange them to make akind of multi platform city space, then hit them all with Krylon spray paints with the for-plastics formulas, again in Lunar color ranges. <br/><br/>Also, I really like the gutted computer terrain concept. I'd love to see you run with that and kinda make up a cyber dungeon for netruns. That would be cool as hell. You could put all kinds of weird day-glo objects in there as various security and traps.<br/><br/>Minis wise, Cooplestone if you have the money. If not, hit megaminis, or actually look for old unopened Shadowrun minis on e-bay. I tend to see a number of them come up at close to original price. Apparently there are lots around gathering dust in obscure FLGs. You might also look at the EM 4 futuristic minis for ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D" title="Noah_D"><img alt="Noah_D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D">Noah_D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376098/#Comment_376098" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T04:21:56+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  4:21AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2012 4:22AM by Noah_D.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For other cyberpunk minis, check Rezolution, Sedition Wars, and Antenociti's Workshop.<br/><br/>I'm looking at the linoleum squares, glued back-to-back.

The beauty of Islamic archetecture is that you can do it any way you like. They can be balistic missles (like your's) or squat towers barely above the roof.<br/><br/>I have some ideas on how to make a futuristic city. Computer and other equipment styrofoam packing stuffers. These premade styrofoam pieces come in interesting and futuristic shapes. We already associate them with technology (they house our toys after all). You can pretty cleanly cut them up with a box cutter or a reciprocating knife (I prefer the box cutter myself). Slap some paint on them and place them on a table cloth and you have a city.

Okay, reactions can get a bit messy, but they walk you through them. A half-dozen units moving about with gunfire everywhere is...messy. The writers (Osprey publishes it, Ambush Alley Games wrote it) are very helpful and there's a growing community. Their scifi version, Tomorrow's War, is rapidly becoming the go-to for the exploding 15mm scifi market (and people tired of 40K). Breaking News' embedded journalists and painful victory conditions would adapt rather well.<br/><br/>Then again, I'm curious to see what you've come up with - is TF Roach something you've written, or...?<br/><br/>(Also, your post reminded me of the best console shooter ever, Full Spectrum Warrior. You've got two fireteams of 4, there are insurgents running around everywhere. If you're out in the open, you're almost always dead. In cover, alive...mostly. If one of your men was injured, you <i>had</i> to take him back to the aid station, where he might recover, be taken out and replaced, or taken out and not replaced...and now you're down a man.

I'm mostly trying to ask about how simplification is used to bring that altogether, and if there are some guiding philosophies/methods to it that could be translated over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377488/#Comment_377488" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T09:29:02+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  9:29AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Model railroaders have a term "selective compression." A big use of that, say you have an industrial building with 20 loading bays. Such a building in HO might fill your whole 4'x8' table. So you build a model that resembles the real building but only has 2 or 3 or maybe even 4 loading bays. Model railroaders will also model a town by modeling the most important industries (since they are important to the "operation") and then some number of other buildings that help set the tone.<br/><br/>So in this mindset, if you want to have a minis game covering a countryside with several towns, model each town with 1-5 buildings, picking representative structures that help define that town.<br/><br/>Another technique that model railroaders use is separating the layout into scenes with some kind of scenic barrier. That could also be used in a minis game, you would just pick some appropriate barrier. Model railroaders preferably use room walls, or if that's impractical, use a vertical panel, and if that's impractical, use a hill or some such. Then you define the conditions to move between scenes including the possibility of some number of turns "off screen" to represent longer travel time (which model railroaders will do also, if they have a long tunnel between scenes, they might hold a train in the tunnel for some defined time).<br/><br/>Yet another technique that model railroaders will use to make the scene look larger is to place smaller scale structures in the background to create forced perspective. There are probably some ways to use that technique, but it's less useful since in a minis game you want all the play space to be playable. Model railroaders are willing to sacrifice some of their scene space to have non-functional (stuff thats not track or buildings being serviced by the trains) scenery to help set the scene.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377491/#Comment_377491" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T09:37:22+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  9:37AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 10:14AM by komradebob.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect that some form of, what do you guys call em?

This allows more scope for modelling larger areas since most battle (as opposed to skirmish) wargames use man:figure ratios in order to conserve space and painting time. Even if you are using 1:1 (skirmish) rules it can work as it makes the figures the focus of the action and terrain somewhat fade into the background.
