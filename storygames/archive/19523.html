Cards certainly don't play the same way that dice do. It may be possible to create a story game that plays more like Chess- Move and then Countermove. Engines like these would make for some games that feel very different from your basic D&amp;D clone.<br/><br/>However, are they worth producing? Would such mutant games have an audience?

Using rock-paper-scissors is a game changer.  Using votes is a game changer.  But what is the game?  Does the mechanic fit it?  Do you see my point here?<br/><br/>Trying to predict the appeal of an unwritten game based on a mechanic is probably not the wisest way to go.  Generally it makes more sense to conceive of the game first, and then find or construct a mechanic that matches the dynamics of the fiction you're trying to create.  It's kinda like saying "What is the necessity of balls in sports?"  Depends on the sport, doesn't it.  Some don't use balls at all.<br/><br/>I suppose it's possible you might discover or invent a mechanical device or subsystem that's so fascinating and unusual in its decision-making potential that it inspires you to create a whole game around it.  But that still doesn't tell me whether I'd be interested in your game.

You need some uncertainty to make it fun.<br/><br/>That uncertainty can be <i>random</i>: for example, when you throw the ball against a wall to catch it, and it doesn't bounce the same way every time. Or it can come from <i>other players</i>: for example, when you throw the ball to others and they don't always throw the way you expect.<br/><br/>That translates to roleplaying games too. When you're roleplaying, you want some uncertainty to make it fun. That can come from dice, from the storytelling of others or from somewhere else, but it must be there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434126/#Comment_434126" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T01:38:31+00:00" title="June 21, 2014  1:38AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2014 8:55PM by Keith Sears.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True. An engine doesn't tell you what an entire game is like, but it can greatly change how a game feels when you play it. For example, Jenga and the Dread RPG are a perfect fit since the mechanic evokes stress in the players as the game continues. Sooner or later, that tower is going to fall and the character involved is out of the game. It would not be nearly as effective if it were done with dice.<br/><br/>At this particular point, I am indulging my <a href="http://dramatic-games.com/2013/10/30/a-tale-of-three-brains/" rel="nofollow">Crazy Brain</a> in its quest for new ideas. The poll may surprise me or simply give me a meh answer by the time it closes. The discussions that occur while it is open may provide me with answers for questions I have yet to ask.<br/><br/>Are dice necessary for a game? No, of course not. Its silly to even ask. How do you <i>feel</i> about dice? That is an entirely different matter. Some gamers get very attached to their dice. I'm really no exception. I have a pair of Gamescience d10s that I have had since the early '80's and I swear they are still in pristine condition. I made one design that used only d6s and one playtester complain that she wanted to use All her dice. My current group swears up and down that I have some kind of Dice Mojo that allows me to roll better than them.<br/><br/>Will my question lead to better games? Maybe. I won't know until I ask.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434127/#Comment_434127" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T01:46:15+00:00" title="June 21, 2014  1:46AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2014 1:49AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Graham on this one.

But I like what you said.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Keith">@Keith</a> Sears - I will answer your last question (feelings about dice), which is different than your first question (<i>necessity</i> of dice).  I will completely ignore your other question (are they worth producing).<br/><br/>I feel, like most of the players I've ever run, that dice are imbued with a magical energy.  They are like demons to a sorceror.  They can tell the future, they can yield to your will, they can become your favorite, they can have good days and bad days, and they can turn against you.  Of course we know that this is all projection.  But it is a <i>very very common</i> projection.  Does that mean dice <i>must</i> be the mechanic of uncertainty?  Of course not.  But you do need to find or invent <i>some</i> uncertainty mechanic that gives your game the feeling you want it to have, and use it.<br/><br/>Uncertainty in a game represents and embodies a central aspect of existence: the fact that life is full of things you can't predict, which affect you.  If there isn't any uncertainty, you violate the Czege Principle ("creating your own adversity <i>and</i> its resolution is boring"), and whatever you're doing becomes almost impossible to call a game.  Even without violating that principle, some of the games we've been talking about here lately - including one of my own - fall into this grey area where it's almost more fitting to call it an "exercise" than a "game".  <br/><br/><b>Playing a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.</b> <i>(Will I succeed?  I don't know!  It's exciting!)</i><ul><li> If there is <i>just one tiny little portion</i> of the rules which is beyond my control and affects me, I can still call it a game, but it's getting difficult.</li><li> If there are other players and they are adversarial or competitive (in either sense of the word) relative to me, I can still call it a game.</li><li> But if everything is admissible and everything is cooperative, that is an <i>exercise,</i> not a game.</li></ul>\nThere are different types of uncertainty mechanics.<ul><li> If you use a physical mechanic (dice or whatever), the uncertainty represents the fact that the world is constantly a surprise, and affects you.</li><li> If you use a procedural mechanic (person to my left starts my sentence for me or whatever), the uncertainty represents the fact that other people are constantly a surprise, and affect you.</li></ul>Sports use both physical and procedural mechanics, if you think about it, but the uncertainty is all physical.  From the coin toss to the capricious wind to the condition of the field to the trajectory of an object flying through 3space.<br/><br/>Back to fiction games.  Your attention may be focused on the physical events of the gameworld, or your attention may be focused on the social activity in the gameworld, or a mixture of both.  It's possible to imagine a game where the object (the unnecessary obstacle) is to remain attentive even though the whole thing is getting more and more <b>boring</b>.  That would <i>not</i> be fun.  But it <i>would</i> be a game.<br/><br/>Now jumping down one level: Within the ontology of the game world (i.e through the eyes of a PC), the mechanical uncertainty we've been looking at does not <i>represent</i> anything - it <i>embodies</i> the unpredictable nature of existence, either physical, or social, or both.  Even if you don't consider yourself a Simulationist, this is one thing your fiction game <i>will</i> simulate: the nature of someone existing within a causal reality bigger than their own agency.  This is the single common trait possessed by all fiction-creating methodologies that can truly be called "games".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/maracanda" title="maracanda"><img alt="maracanda" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/236/nYDJK66XVHRHJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/maracanda">maracanda</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434129/#Comment_434129" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T02:17:46+00:00" title="June 21, 2014  2:17AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2014 2:27AM by maracanda.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dice are like balls in yet another way: sometimes they inspire people to downplay the fiction and start playing competetively against eachother and against the rules (because of the expectation of dice/ball). <br/><br/>Moreover, I don't think there needs to be a 'randomizer' per se, dice or another game changer. That's just one way of fulfilling the need to have <i>something in the middle</i>, something to keep the peace between the writers-players, a referee. Often this is 'rules' or 'random' (=something which creates a priori equality). A social contract that stipulates 'playing like fiction' as thing-in-the-middle works equally fine. But that may not be so easy to determinate as clearly as mechanical rules (although possible), and is still nothing more than people agreeing (all it needs is someone saying 'I don't go along with the rules/with playing like fiction' to break the contract).<br/><br/>So it boils down to making sure there's something formal which you can agree on. In our case we have to make sure that 'this' actually allows and stimulates better fiction. It's no use to emulate the deliberateness of (written) fiction, rp is another type of fiction, with other needs.<br/><br/>I am making a <a href="http://www.ciantel.be/alienor/" rel="nofollow">game</a> that looks and plays like literature, but is actually based off the mechanics of oral conversation, which are closer to rp. There's some dice and randomness, but no where near central. The game changer in it is a bit more elusive, and I'm eager to see if it works.<br/><br/>[edit: I guess my post was superseded while typing by the more eloquent and comprehensive post by AsIf!]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434141/#Comment_434141" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T09:47:49+00:00" title="June 21, 2014  9:47AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played one RPG that didn't use dice or other randomized -- Mortal Coil -- and I found it didn't work for me: the lack of randomness induced a pretty strong analysis-paralysis.

Players are usually unpredictable, so even when there's no physical element of randomisation, there's always the fact they'll push the plot towards totally unplanned directions. Even in a railroadish game, the GM might have to ocasionally go out of their way to keep things on track. This alone differs the experience of writing a story on your own, with no other creative force to compete.<br/><br/>Dice are supposed to be an unbiased input, so as long as it's coherent it doesn't bother me. That's not the same as saying you need them to play, but games flow better when they have something to play the role dice are usually there to represent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434167/#Comment_434167" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-22T02:49:56+00:00" title="June 22, 2014  2:49AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main thing to avoid in RPG design is cargo cult design -- copying succesful elements without understanding the underlying principles that make them succesful. <br/><br/>So the question isn't "are dice good", the question is "are dice good for THIS game, and why?"<br/><br/>Is it a story game? Awesome. How do dice contribute to the game's agenda? (Maybe they introduce constraints to inspire creativity, as in Fiasco. Maybe they ensure spontaneity.)

Not easy to answer. To have a broader picture, consider this:<br/>1. Playing chess vs backgammon<br/>2. Children playing with dolls vs playing a board game<br/><br/>1. Both chess and backgammon are tactical (BG is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> a game of luck, if you play at a certain level), both are about two minds working against each other. Both work fine, but dice make backgammon less deterministic and give it an element of surprise &amp; excitement.<br/><br/>2. When children play with dolls, they don't use dice, they still play - heck, they even roleplay! Still, they experience excitement and joy. I guess it's fun because they <i>improvise</i>: So, they use creativity, an open-mind and sensibility to interact with each other.<br/><br/>So, dice mechanics give games a certain flavor.<br/>Randomizers are not necessary for roleplaying and having fun. If you have players who enjoy improvisation and stay open-minded about what will happen, you can ditch randomizer mechanics.<br/><br/>This is very subjective and not comprehensive. Please consider this just as some brainstorming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434230/#Comment_434230" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-23T11:25:58+00:00" title="June 23, 2014 11:25AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems to me that the success of games like Amber, MURPG and Castle Falkestein is testament to the fact that dice are not <i>needed</i>.
