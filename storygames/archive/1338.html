                    We've discussed this before, and even whipped up a report card of fabulous player behaviors to encourage.  Anyway, I put together a list of <a href="http://www.meekmok.com/games/rpg/tsoy/player_keys.pdf" rel="nofollow">player keys</a>, ostensibly for TSOY.  I'm interested in feedback on the following:<br/><br/>1.  Are these too broad or too narrow?  Did I miss any (all are stolen from the report card)?  Are any redundant or tedious?<br/><br/>2.  What's the best way to assign value to these behaviors, and how much?  I chose 1 or 2 XP and imagined players just adding them based on self reflection at the end of every session.  I know this should vary from group to group, but how do I peg player behavior and flags to character behavior and flags?  What's the exchange rate?<br/><br/>Oh, and if you want to write a few sentences describing the value of a particular key, I sorta ran out of steam as you will see if you check 'em out.                </div>

                            Jason, the issue I have with these is that their XP conditions are really vague and wishy-washy.  "Consistently do X"?  So when do I get my XP? At the end of each session?  Lame!  You need actual, concrete things that people can do in order to get XP NOW!  Like "incorperate another player's suggestion into my narration."  Boom!  1 XP.                        </div>

                            Hmm, that's a good note, Jonathan, but I'd like to see examples for some of those, like the Key of Perspective.  That's reinforcing a very positive behavior, but it isn't at the table.

                            Thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
Yes, tie the keys to actions that directly impact the table, or even to results of actions.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like it if Key of Stakes looked like this:<br/>
1XP setting cool and compelling and equitable stakes in a conflict<br/>
3XP setting compelilng equitable stakes that are so cool that players can't decide which is cooler, winning them or loosing them<br/>
If the players collectively throw gift dice at both sides of the conflict, that's an automatic 3XP<br/>
<br/>
We have a player with a key like this:<br/>
Key of Pontification<br/>
1XP for using cool in-game technobabble<br/>
3XP for using cool in-game technobabbly in a way that moves the action forward<br/>
One of our players runs a scientist-type character who is continually holding forth on bizarre scientific principles and quoting obscure imaginary texts. We forced him to take this key the third time he instantly defined a peice of camptian background in an off-the-cuff remark. If the player gives a name to a person, place, or thing in the game and it becomes a permanent part of the game world, that's an automatic 3XP.<br/>
<br/>
How about:<br/>
Key of Goals Setting<br/>
1XP for creating a cool goal for you or another character that helps drive the action forward<br/>
3XP for creating a cool goal that drives the action forward and makes things more complicated for everybody                        </div>

                            Weird side thought:<br/><br/>These keys could be really useful in a slightly altered form for something like a By Night LARP, where you have a bunch of players and it's hard for the STs to keep track of everyything going on.<br/><br/>Instead of STs handing out the xps, each player gets, say 5 chits ( 1xp each) that the can give out throughout the night to other players. Presumably, the STs have a similar amount. Ther could just be a space on the chit to write in one of the keys/achieved, your player name and character name, reciever's character name and player name. You don't keep your chits-you can only give them to other players.<br/><br/>The STs don't really do much award handing out. Rather they simply keep track of t.                        </div>

                            That seems like an effective way to put more authority in players hands in a LARP for sure - let them pick their keys and be rewarded for hitting them.  But that'd work just fine for character keys as well.                        </div>

<p>Hey Jason,</p>
<p>I'm unwrapping my snarky-bat.  Because I love.</p>
<p>Aren't all keys "player keys"?  I mean, they're all rewards to the player for particular behaviors on the part of the player.  If the character does something, it's only because the player narrated them doing that something.</p>
<p>I think what you've got here are meta-keys.  They stand (for the most part) outside the narrative actions of your character.</p>
<p>Are they even keys?  TSOY's keys are rewards I set for myself.  If I choose the Key of the Mission, then I get my reward when I guide the narration around my character towards that mission.  Your keys are rewards that one player sets for another, not for themselves.  It's a trivial and silly point, and doesn't mean that what you're creating isn't goodness, but worth noting.</p>
<p>So, what I'm wondering is, what are you trying to get at here?  Some form of Gamer's Preschool?  How about the Key of Sharing?  Gain 1 XP when you give me a piece of your gum.  Gain 2 XP when you bring enough for the whole class.</p>
<p>Seriously though, you did make me think of an "I'm gonna make you awesome"-style Key;</p>
<h4>Key of the lackey</h4>
<p>Your character owes allegience to another PC.  Gain 1 XP when they are in the spotlight, looking awesome.  Gain 3 XP when you use your spotlight time to focus on them.</p>

                            I'd call that something tastier than <em>lackey</em>, and by your own logic, that's just essential game table behavior, right?  But yes, in any case, the intent of these diverges from TSOY's character-driven keys.<br/><br/>What I was thinking is that explicitly encouraging certain metagame behaviors is good.  Sharing is indeed good - Key of Teamwork.  Cleaning up is good - Key of Organization.  Being nice is good.  Telling a funny story is good.  It's great when everybody does all these things all the time, but nobody can, because we're carnivorous stink-apes.<br/><br/>So Eric, I challenge you - show me how to use system to make awesome players more awesome, abstracted from actual play.                        </div>

                            Jonathan makes a good point and I bet most of the 'consistently' stuff can be nailed down to concrete actions.  "That was so thoughtful--XP from the Key of Compassion."  Or "You weren't at last session because you had to help a friend move, take 2 XP from perspective."  It seems like Keys rock so much because they are reinforcement, right there when the action happens, not some hours later. In that light, maybe Perspective should be something like "Aww, Jonathan,  you can't make it man because you have to go listen to some guy talk about Chinese Cults?  Take 2 xp from perspective."<br/><br/>The problem, of course, becomes the exchange rate--Key of Perspective won't get nearly as much as the key of compassion.  Of course, then, that guy isn's showing up to the session at all, so I don't know if that is problematic.  Especially if they could also take the Key of Preparation and help out a little between sessions.<br/><br/>That also makes player keys as potent in their way as character keys and, well, I don't know, that sort of makes sense.  If someone comes to the table and is a great player, what's wrong with laying it on them for that?  If someone rocks the Key of Preparation, they make the game better for everyone and one or two XP points a session doesn't really seem to capture that contribution's value.                        </div>

                            I think the difference with Eric's Key of the Lackey is that the rewarded behavior is implemented through the character- it's a part of the game.  There's a reason none of our group are taking the existing meta-keys ("Key of Gaming at My House", etc.)- to some folks, it just feels wrong to mix up social dynamics and roleplaying (or gameplay in general, I suppose).  I think these are all worthwhile habits to encourage among your friends, but I'm not sure rewarding them through the game mechanics is appropriate.  <br/><br/>Should a player get experience for his all-but-NPC character every time he stays at home with his family instead of gaming (which is, you know, every time)?  If so, why?  Clearly, the game isn't enough to bring him to the table, and he's already getting rewards for being at home with his kids.<br/><br/>If one of the players never showered, would you create a "Key of Cleanliness" to encourage him to bathe?   More to the point, would <em>the player choose</em> such a key for himself?                        </div>

                            I hear you, Steve, although I personally disagree with that dichotomy.  I think in the back of my head I was thinking they could be used to challenge players somehow, just like you might take the key of love if you always play rough-tough loners, to push yourself.  If you're the guy who consistently stumbles in without knowing what's going on, taking the key of Preparation serves as a reminder (with a trivial reward mechanism) that you're working on it, because being more prepared will make you a better player.  If we did this in our group, I'd totally take the key of Stake-setting, because that's something I want to get better at.  But I can totally see how it could be interpreted as ugly and pedantic.                        </div>

                            Hmm.. I think I'm reacting to some of the things on your list, without considering the whole.  Many of the Keys you suggest seem perfectly reasonable as meta-game keys ("key of scene-framing"), while others (the ones that raised my hackles, such as the "Key of Kindness") are more about modifying social dynamics in the group, and I think that's outside the scope of game mechanics.<br/><br/>I still think you'd have a hard time getting a lot of players to take meta-keys, simply because they're more comfortable focusing their play through their characters, and letting the system fade to the background.  But that might just be my perspective.                        </div>

<p>Before I get on to being productive, I do want to say that I still have a real issue with any meta keys.  That issue being the growth of my character via a non-narrative source.  I make veggie burgers for everyone and now my character learns to love again?  I just don't dig it.</p>
<p>Now, if we're talking about coming up with a system for encouraging improved gaming <em>skills</em>, like stakes setting or scene framing, then I say let's look at a meta-system with a meta-reward.  Something that lies entirely outside of the narrative.  Personally, I'm a fan of being super-straight-up about it.  I'd show up to the table and say "Hey dudes.  I totally want to improve my scene framing skills tonight.  So, keep an eye on me, take notes on where I can improve, and then tell me all about where I fucked up at the end of the session.  And, oh yeah, what can I take notes on for you?"</p>
<p>But here, lemmie give you the key I keep thinking of now...</p>
<p><strong>The Key of not being a Dick</strong><br/>
Don't be a dick.  Be a dude.  Gain 1XP whenever you take the position of hosting a game seriously, like finding out what your players do and don't like to eat.  Gain 1XP when you vocalize your needs and wants to your fellow gamers in a productive way.  Like the desire to not smell someone else's BO, or to start the game on time every time.  Gain 2XP when you respond to criticisim and feedback in a positive way.</p>
<p>Now, go back and replace "Gain XP" with either "Become a better gamer" or "Become a better friend", whichever one is more fitting to your hippie nature.</p>

                            For my part: I would be very, <i>very</i> uncomfortable about participating in a game where participants were encouraged to assign each other personal growth goals, and then make judgement calls on how the various participants are behaving.<br/><br/>Specifically, it would not feel like I was spending an evening with mature friends interacting with one another as grown-ups; it would feel like I was in primary school again, with a set list of positive behaviours that I get gold star for from Teacher/the GM. The Keys of Socialisation seem, to me, to be just that. The other keys seem superb, don't get me wrong, but I think the Socialisation ones can be jettisoned. The Key of Perspective, in particular, seems to involve making judgement calls on how other people live their lives, which is just as likely to make people say "Where the hell do you get off treating a grown man/woman like this?" as it is to make them change their behaviour.<br/><br/>As for the Key of Kindness - if a player isn't treating the other people in the group with respect, there's no point pussyfooting around with semi-in-game measures to solve what is essentially an out-of-game problem with rudeness and insensitivity. Someone who doesn't respect you and is unkind to you is, by definition, Not Your Friend. Don't game with them.                        </div>

                            It seems like part of what you want here is a way for players to reward each other for bringing teh Awesome during a game, in all its varied forms- right?  So maybe what you're reaching for is something that we've done instinctively before with different game systems, and is represented in PTA as Fan Mail- a simple mechanic for saying "That was fantastic! I'm giving you a bonus!"<br/>
<br/>
If you want to set something like that up using TSoY rules, my suggestion would be to create one Key- or maybe one Key for each of these categories you've defined- and have the GM require them at the start of play for every character.  So instead of taking the "Key of Drama" individually, every character has the "Key of Performance" (or the "Key of Awesome"), which defines how they get experience for doing really cool meta-things (setting great stakes, giving up conflicts at the perfect moment, supporting other players greatest moments, etc.) during play.<br/>
<br/>
This is still a bit of a departure from the Fan Mail approach, since the players give themselves rewards in TSoY, but that's just the way the game we're talking about works, right?                        </div>

This is true, but in my personal experience the least bearable people with sociability problems are the ones who don't recognise that they have a problem with hygiene/friendliness/being bad-tempered anyhow.<br/><br/>If the person in question already knows they've got a problem and are trying to change, then, erm, they're already changing and the problem is in the process of correcting itself.<br/>If the person in question doesn't know they have a problem (or do and simply don't care), they're not going to take the keys.<br/><br/>Either way, their utility is strictly limited.                        </div>

<p>So, like, I don't get how this is importantly different from like "give less XP if player A decides that character A stabs character B in the face and ruins the evening." It's still systemic treatment of extrasystemic stuff, and I'm not sure how healthy that is.</p>

                            I wonder why we're all italic since Eric's post like 5 posts ago. Eric, what did you do?<br/><br/>Shreyas - Here's how I view it: I want to have as much fun as possible at my table. That fun is maximized for everyone when extrasystemic stuff is rewarded (because play will improve), and if it is more fun for some people for that reward to come in-system, I have absolutely no issue with that. Now, I see your point that it would not be cool for me to say, by fiat - "Hey, I want everyone to play exactly my way and anyone who does differently - their character will pay the price!"  But I don't think that's what's being done here.                        </div>

<p>Dave,</p>
<p>I don't know.  I checked my post again, but don't see anything in the ordinary in it.  I suspect either Jason or, more likely, Arthur above him.  Notice that Jason's post is all italics too.</p>

                            Pretty sure it's nothing I did - it looks like it's either Jason or Komradebob.<br/>

                            My fault.  It is symptomatic of the deep corruption this topic obviously engenders in all who read it.  <br/><br/>I know for a fact that player keys would work better with some groups than with others, and some of the keys are more solid and helpful than others.  So YMM, as they say, V.  If you don't see the utility, or know your friends would reject the idea wholesale, that's cool, don't use them or think about them.  Heard you the first time, Eric.<br/><br/>Dave, I'd prune the list to the ones that you know will rock for you and your friends.  I'm interested in hearing what that boils down to.  <br/><br/>Shreyas, I guess there are different ways to use keys, but we self medicate with them.  There's nobody making a value judgement except the player himself.  I don't have any trouble mixing metagame and in-game rewards.                        </div>
