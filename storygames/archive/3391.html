Ironically, this is because I feel I talk too much about myself and what I'm doing, and I don't want to be egotistical. But maybe I should fill in some empty areas of what's going on in my design process.</p>\n<p>As I've mentioned before, I'm aiming at one more or less standard system to handle most of my games. Not in the generic universal sense of a system, but more like a basic approach that I would modify to suit the needs of a specific game. I'm too lazy to start from scratch for every game, and I think that's kind of unnecessary, anyways, unless the fundamental structure of my standard game system is simply too discordant with what I need for a project.</p>\n<p>So really, you guys have seen part of what I'm working on already, because in each of the design challenges, I try a slightly new approach to that same system, trying to work out what I want that standard system to be. You guys have seen the way I treat conflict resolution: roll dice to create your basic resources for that conflict, spend successes to create temporary advantages or to damage characters or objects, use skills and advantages to reroll dice. I started doing the "spend successes" thing in The Court of 9 Chambers, and started doing the reroll thing in Icerunner (but, curiously, didn't use rerolling again until Comedy Blackout.)</p>\n<p>Those of you who looked at Depths of Kanthe probably noticed another thing I was doing: rolling dice in a box or on a sheet of paper and interpreting the results based on <em>where</em> the dice land. The most extreme form is the mapping rules for Kanthe, where you not only pay attention to where the dice land, but also the orientation. I also use <em>dice maps</em> in Kanthe; this is a sheet of paper you roll the dice on for discovery and resolution. There's a set of concentric squares, labeled "Doors and Traps" (the outermost,) Creatures and Beasts, and Features (the innermost.) Where the dice land determines what you find. There's also an overlay with a different set of labels tied to magical verbs and nouns, which allows you to interpret other things. A major part of what I've been doing lately is just messing with those verbs and nouns, trying to figure out the best set to select for what I want out of that game.</p>\n<p>Now, as it so happens, I plan on using this approach in other games, too. Partly because one of my design goals is to make every game playable solo, at the very least for training purposes. Partly also because I'm interested in dice interpretation more than I am in dice resolution. So, I have a space patrol game in the works where I want to use a dice map to determine plot twists and alien cultures discovered (I pretty much have the guts of the space patrol game, and it's just this part I need to finish.) I have vague ideas for other uses of these dice maps, too, but they aren't as far along.</p>\n<p>So, I don't have much to show you... except for some <a href="http://talysman.googlepages.com/dicemaps.pdf" rel="nofollow">dice maps</a>. I had the brilliant idea of designing generic dice maps so that I could use them in my design process, instead of designing a unique dice map for each game, only to have to change it every time an idea didn't work. What I generally do with these is assign descriptors to each number or letter, roll dice on the map, and look for the highest result. Sometimes, I look for both the highest and the lowest, and interpret them in different ways. The maps are arranged radially, so that if dice fall outside the box, you just extend the boundaries mentally to see where the dice landed. If a die lands on a line, it's counted for both results.</p>\n<p>The nine-part dice map is going to be the basis for my rewrite of The Court of 9 Chambers; rather than have players do numerology, they roll on a dice map with the letters of the alphabet assigned to nine chambers. The five-part dice map with the pentagon will probably be used for a rewrite of Icerunner, as well as a swords-and-sorcery game called Malignment. The six-part dice map with the hexagons is what I will probably use for the space patrol game. The seven-part dice map would have been what I would have used for my own attempt to do a "musical noire" game, if I had felt like developing that idea.</p>\n<p>What do I want help with? At this point, I would just like to see what other people can do with the dice maps. Think of it as a mini-challenge!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
