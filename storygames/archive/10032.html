I.e., the diplomatic skill challenges that choke the life out of the first two WotC modules. "OK, he likes you a little better... now a little better... and a little more better..." Wow, that's dull.<br/>\n<br/>\nMountZionRyan's example is an awesome one. That's a great use of the concept, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a Living Forgotten Realms module with a great investigatory skill challenge; it spread across five or six different locations, with each one having a couple of individual pieces of information that lead to other locations. It's not linear; depending on what the PCs decide to do, they can skip some of the red herrings, or skip past one of the investigation steps, or so on. The authors also inserted a fight into the middle of the challenge to break things up a bit. Failure results in bad guys being alerted and a slightly harder combat later on, rather than complete breakdown of the module.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I really wanted to run a social/diplomatic challenge using this mechanism, I'd set it at... say... some sort of court event. Instead of just having to win over the king, I'd spread the thing out over the entire evening. Players decide who they want to approach, and you need to change the opinion of the court as a whole rather than one guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222690/#Comment_222690" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T09:05:52+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  9:05AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob mentioned on Twitter an idea that uses this system to introduce costs of actions, not whether those actions succeed or not.

That's not necessarily bad, it's just true.  The same issue exists in Mouse Guard.  Some games help you keep that discipline by making certain mechanics impossible to apply without the fiction.  Others are willing to just assume you have the discipline.  It's a value neutral design consideration.

If the DM wishes, he could easily resolve the situation based merely on the RP, or a secret die roll. If he already knows he wants the situation to go in a specific direction, he can do so. If he wants the king to be shaken, then the king is always shaken.<br/><br/>2) But if he does want it to be based on a die roll, he then assigns an appropriate bonus to the roll based on the scenario as it unfolded. This can happen in 4e as well, BUT because of the sense that there are at least four more die rolls coming, I think there's less willingness on the part of the players to invest in the situation.

I'm hearing a lot of procedural solutions.<br/><br/>How about if there were a group pool of dice that was rolled each round? The whole game had a countdown timer on it. You need five successes before three failures by the end of the session and this pool is rolled once a round. On your turn, your actions will add or remove dice from the pool, thereby changing the odds the next time that pool is rolled.

It's a skill roll, with modifiers, like you say. Maybe it could be <i>part</i> of a skill challenge, but if you're gonna make 8 rolls (or whatever) the fictional situation has to support that much investment. That's why "Uh... I intimidate him again?" sounds weak. Because the situation is weak. Standing in front of a dude and taking turns talking to him is a lame skill challenge (though Adam, with his superior skillz, made it work).<br/><br/>I think D&amp;D4 does a <b>terrible</b> job of explaining how to make skill challenges fun and useful. If you already know how to use a mechanic like that in a productive way (lots of Trollbabe play was my training ground), then you probably think it's a good mechanic. If you don't, it falls flat and "the mechanic sucks." Really, the mechanic is just fine, and has plenty of uses, as the thread subject explores.<br/><br/>The real failing, IMO, is in how the mechanic was presented and explained.

A combination of things, not just one player hammering Intimidate over and over. If it's not that kind of thing, then a single Intimidate check might be fine.<br/><br/>As a skill challenge, if Ed keeps saying, "How many ways can I intimidate a guy?" my answer would be, "I don't know, Ed. If you can't think of any more, then you better try a different skill." Social encounters require some player skill in D&amp;D. You have to at least justify the skill you are using with some kind of believable cause-and-effect in the fiction. It's why Ed can't say, "I use Arcana to get past the orc king." Every player at the table needs to know /how/. Every skill use has to be justified. If you keep hammering at the same skill, you better be able to back it up with role-playing and justification in the fiction. Perhaps Ed resorts to threats that are scarier and scarier. "I'm gonna hurt you, little man." "I will gouge out your eyes with my knife and fry them with some trail bacon." "HRANGAR cracks the muscles in his back and tells the orc that he's going to break him in half and suck the fluid out of his spine." Ed is just being a baby, in my opinion.<br/><br/>If Ed role-plays something awesome, I give him a +2 bonus or something. Yay. <br/><br/>But this challenge wasn't set up as "You guys have to /intimidate/ the orc king to avoid fighting him." It's open-ended. Skills that seem reasonable to me: Intimidate, Diplomacy, Bluff, Stealth. Skills that are sketchy or might be good "aid another" skills: Athletics (run past him), Streetwise (use contacts to know something about the orc?), Insight (understand that the king just wants to be loved?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222766/#Comment_222766" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T12:07:44+00:00" title="August  5, 2009 12:07PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, could say the same thing about DitV, too--the Call BS Rule is important when the right to use an in-game ability is constrained by providing narrative rationale for its use. (I am facing the same issue with ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a>, and I wish I could find a mechanical way to enforce invocation rather than rely on group consensus.)<br/>-----<br/>I think "roll X successes before Y failures" could work for a caper-style story.<br/><br/>But the real thing I see missing from skill challenges is a mechanical feedback into the X/Y system. A success should not only get one closer to X, but should have some knock-on benefit for subsequent checks, as appropriate (and vice versa, for failures). For example:<br/><br/><b>Seducing The Princess</b><br/>* The princess is always has the first dance and is ever the eyes of the entire court.<br/>-- Success with Dancing: +2 to Seduction check; failure: \xb10<br/>* Proper manners only, for a proper lady.<br/>-- Success with Etiquette: +1 to Seduction check; failure: -1<br/>* She values a subtle mind, and will brook no blowhards.<br/>-- Success with Diplomacy: \xb10 to Seduction check; failure -2<br/>* "We are not amused."<br/>-- Attempting any Carousing or Gamboling: -2 to Seduction check<br/>* She has had the best tutors... and so rarely has challenging conversation, unfortunately.<br/>-- Attempting any History or Knowledge: +1 to Seduction roll<br/><br/>And, of course, the Seduction roll must be the last roll. In fact, this could be done without even having a "roll X before Y" setup; you could just let the PC(s) keep trying different conversational and social gambits, either building up a huge bonus (sweeping her off her feet, so to speak) or getting enough rope to hang themselves (possibly never even attempting to Seduce, as her aloof attitude slowly perverts to chilly disinterest, contemptuous disdain, and finally affronted fury!).<br/><br/>In fact... why don't more games do this sort of thing, inherently, with skill checks? I *think* Burning Wheel does something like this with Extended Challenges (success = an extra Helping die, maybe?); and I think the old James Bond Role Playing Game did this very thing with seduction (I know it took multiple checks, one for each stage of the "dance"). But why don't more games actually build + and - into extended task resolution, factored by the choice of action. Maybe it would make for too many Charts and Graphs, just to design an encounter (as above--and what if they wanted to, say, get her to leave the castle without doing a seduction? What +/- for THOSE related skills?)?<br/><br/>A simpler method would be to just let the roll-over of a success add some amount (say half of the roll-over) to the following roll; and vice versa for the roll-under of a failure. That, however, can make for a virtuous or vicious spiral, hinging largely on the first roll. So maybe any success is a flat +1 and any failure is a flat -1? That seems almost irrelevant, on a scale of 1 to 20.<br/><br/>I dunno... it seems like yet another D&amp;D system which depends almost entirely on the GM/module to make the challenge interesting and narrative and not just a roll-off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222767/#Comment_222767" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T12:08:14+00:00" title="August  5, 2009 12:08PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2009 12:08PM by aeonite.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with the last few posts.<br/><br/>I must say though that I also sort of have problems with skill challenges that deal with broader factors, such as "find your way through the dark forest" or "infiltrate the castle" or "disarm the room full of traps." The repeat attempts using the same skill over and over is what really damages this for me. If I have a skill of 15 thousand in Tracking and a skill of 2 in Local History, which skill am I going to use each time it comes round to me again? I'm going to Track my fool head off. And making me roll 2 or 3 or 5 Track Checks to resolve a single situation -- however stretched out it is -- is frustrating when you boil it down to what's really happening.<br/><br/>"Track Success." "Ok you move along the path."<br/>"Track Failure." "You lose the path."<br/>"Track Success." "You find the path again."<br/>"Track Success." "You find more of the path."<br/>"Track Success." "OK you get to the end of the path. Everyone gets 100 Experience."<br/><br/>The smaller list of skills combined with the near-necessity of re-using your best skill in all applicable situations is a bad combination when everything is framed in these tidy little challenge boxes. I far prefer a broad open-ended scenario spattered with single, varied skill checks, instead of boxes within boxes within boxes. That way a single Track check takes care of that, and the player has to use a different skill when a different situation comes up.<br/><br/>But to get back to the topic:<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, the netrunning or magic-creation example really appeals much more, because it makes sense as a series of quick (or not so quick, but still simple and relevant) checks based on skills. Brewing a potion? Check for each ingredient, bonuses for better ingredients. Making a magic sword, and it's going to take 3 weeks? Check every few days to make sure the magic is holding, bonuses for more attentiveness or better quality components.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222769/#Comment_222769" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T12:13:18+00:00" title="August  5, 2009 12:13PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>But this challenge wasn't set up as "You guys have to /intimidate/ the orc king to avoid fighting him."

I would feel like clawing my eyes out in a group using the skill challenge system as described at the top of this thread.  Adam's example is closer to what I've experienced, except without any prompting needed by the DM to role-play it out.<br/><br/>When I run them, I rarely indicate overtly that a challenge has begun.  Every time I ask for a skill roll I ask myself whether there's an opportunity for a medium or longer term goal where the whole group can participate.  If the answer is yes then a skill challenge might be warranted.  I'll write down on a 3x5 card the number of successes needed (almost always 4) before 3 failures along with the target number needed for a success.  Then we roleplay like we do in any number of other systems, and I'll occasionally ask for skill rolls if it sounds like the narration/roleplay the player is providing warrants it.<br/><br/>The example directly above with Ed and Jimbob seems like a bit of a stretch to me.  A one-on-one challenge where the GM is using a Skill Challenge and requiring multiple successes by one player  asking for the same skill over and over?  None of that is advocated for in the 4E rules; advice against using it that way is present, both in the core books and in subsequent Dragon and Dungeon articles.  4 PCs in a skill challenge with 4 or 5 successes needed before 3 failures is going to take one or two rounds of back-and-forth max.<br/><br/>Lately I've been running challenges that span across an entire session or even a few sessions.  This mode is also present in the RAW 4E.<br/><br/>Me: "So it sounds like you guys are trying to undermine the Thieves' Guild here in Ossary and set yourself up as the local kingpins\u2026"<br/><br/>Nate: "Absolutely!  These guys are amateurs\u2026"<br/><br/>Me: "Well, that may be but these guys are pretty entrenched\u2026 it could take a few weeks.  Still up for it?"<br/><br/>Party: "Yes!"<br/><br/>A couple scenes into the session the fae warlock is down at the Iron Rooster Inn spreading rumors that Geirr is growing old and no longer holds the respect of his men.  Five or ten minutes of role-playing in I ask for a Streetwise roll, gravely passing the rune-marked dice cup that indicates this roll is important.  A twenty-two.  I quietly mark a success on my 3x5 card labeled, "The Takeover." I push the clock forward a couple days and narrate some of those rumors getting back to the group.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the night the party has a combat and beats the crap out of one of the pickpocket runner gangs connected to the guild.  As two of them run for their lives, the party fighter calls after them, "Tell Geirr we're coming for him!"  I arch an eyebrow and pass the cup.  "Sounds Intimidating\u2026"  A fourteen.  I mark a failure on the card.  Geirr hears about this new group in town but he's not scared and calls in some out of town muscle, an allied group of cultists\u2026<br/><br/>And so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222777/#Comment_222777" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T12:39:14+00:00" title="August  5, 2009 12:39PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2009 12:41PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (crossposted with Matt Gagan, who speaks wisdom)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: aeonite</cite>In a "Skill Challenge" framework requiring 5X before 4Y, a successful Stealth check only (mathematically) gets me 20% of the way across the throne room, because there have to be four more successes before my success counts for squat.</blockquote>\nThis isn't true if <i>something happens</i> when you make your Stealth check. You character takes some concrete action and there is a concrete result in the fictional situation. The roll has meaning within the framework of the challenge, but the fictional action/reaction and the changing fictional situation <i>is what matters</i>.<br/><br/>If you always boil it down to the bare rolls and math, it seems flat. But why would anyone want to do that? You can "boil down" the combat mechanics, too, and just roll and compare numbers and subtract damage from HP. Which means what's been boiled away is the reason to play the game in the first place: the fictional causes and fictional results. Without those... well, there's no "there" there.<br/><br/>What's really curious to me is why anyone* would be motivated to do this boiling down business. It's so clearly the enemy of fun. But it's happening, apparently.<br/><br/><br/>(*anyone with previous successful rpg play.

Maybe you interpret 1 success as one person past the orc king. <br/><br/>"Okay, so there's five people in your party. You need 5 successes before 3 failures to get past the orc king. If you try to sneak past him and fail, that person is caught."<br/><br/>"What if we try to talk our way past him."<br/><br/>"Then, obviously, whoever is out in the light is gonna be seen and has to succeed at the talky part. It's too late for them to sneak. You might have some talk as a distraction for the others who want to sneak. I'd treat that as an automatic Aid Another if you succeed."<br/><br/>Your 20% argument feels like those old arguments where people got all up in arms about how losing half your hit points should mean you're half dead, and thus have organs falling out or something, so therefore hit points are ridiculous. The rules as written just don't say that. Skill challenges are abstract things and you can (and must) bring them back to the concrete fiction a) by yourself and b) in a reasonable way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222790/#Comment_222790" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T13:05:14+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  1:05PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2009 1:07PM by jenskot.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you: <br/><br/>- are going to gencon<br/>- play skill challenges where fiction matters and is engaging<br/>- and are going to be running 4E games<br/><br/>Let me know.

This is dumb.  The problem is that the GM is expected to foresee every possible skill use for a given skill challenge and make an exhaustive list of what works and what doesn't. The problem is that it ignores the fiction and makes useless the flexibility of having a DM in the first place. <br/><br/>Some groups would think "that sounds more like History; roll it" is a shell game and cry foul. You're right that those DMs should do as you suggest. Other groups want more immersive play. <br/><br/>Most likely in any group with reasonable social dynamics, this could happen if Fred cares enough:<br/><br/>Adam: "That sounds more like History to me. Roll it."<br/><br/>Fred: "Uh, no I was really shooting for a Diplomacy check. Let me start over."<br/><br/>Adam: (nods)<br/><br/>Fred: "I show him the error of his ways, offering him several reasonable solutions and pointing out the pros and cons of each. In particular, if he lets us pass, he avoids a potentially dangerous fight with us and he doesn't attract the attention of the monsters below. Plus we might return with treasure later. He'd rather bash our brains in when we have some loot to take from us, right?" To the rest of the astonished players: "Hey! We can worry about him later. I want to get into this dungeon!"<br/><br/>In other words, renegotiation, because most players (and DMs) aren't assholes. If the group's social contract is "you said it, it happened," though, then Fred has to suck up the History roll. Really, this isn't THAT uncommon or unreasonable. Is Fred min-maxing? If so, the other players might resent it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222824/#Comment_222824" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T14:24:21+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  2:24PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the 4E rules set up a black list of skills that can't be used.  I think what its doing is assuming that Skill Challenges are prepped in advance rather than created on the fly.  As part of the advanced prep you are supposed to have a feel for how the challenge is likely to progress, just as the various tactical suggestions in an Encounter indicate a general feel for how the fight is likely to progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the players find a way to enter the room other than through the door that the encouter tactics presume, of course the DM is going to have to wing on the fly what tactics the monsters use.  Similarly, if the players manage to find a way to address the Challenge other than through the obvious path the DM's prep presumed, of course they are going to have to wing on the fly what skills are appropriate to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think some people are mistaking helpful prep DM notes for carved in granite prohibitions.  I will grant that the tone of the text can sound more cut and dry, but I think this is basically the result of a) a desire to be clear and succinct, and b) an artifact of the difficulty of effectively editing a consistant voice for a book written by a dozen different people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222829/#Comment_222829" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T14:46:56+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  2:46PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>From the DMG, page 73:</cite>When a player\u2019s turn comes up in a skill challenge, let that player\u2019s character use any skill the player wants.

And yet you <i>really</i> haven't played an engaging skill challenge?<br><br>I have this absurdist image/scenario in my head of these kick ass roleplayers sitting down to a game of IAWA and rolling d6 For Myself + d8 With Love + maybe an Advantage Die back and forth up to three times in conflicts and spinning these amazing narratives.  They're whooping and hollering "Oh No You Fucking Don't You Asshole!"  They've woven this rich tapestry of a story, adding colorful details and pathos.  At the end of the session, they all high five one another and one of them takes a bunch of notes for the Totally Metal AP post they're going to put up on S-G the next day.<br/><br/>Then <i>these same players </i> sit down in the 8:00 pm slot for some 4E and the DM runs a skill challenge, rules-as-written.  The proffered mechanic is 4 successes before 3 failures vs a target number using d20 + mod across a spectrum of skills.  They listlessly roll their dice and mumble their numbers, adding nothing to the fiction.  The DM wordlessly tallies their results.  One of them notices that Kelly has fallen asleep.  Is there really something <i>inherent</i> to that core mechanic relative to IAWA, Dogs, Sorcerer, etc.,  that sucks the life out of any abortive attempts at an engaging story?  I don't think so.<br/><br/>We're all honest actors here, you don't have an edition dog in this fight and have expressed your actual experience faithfully.  Something else is going on here\u2026 <br/><br/>I think there's an interesting lesson here <i>somewhere</i> about player expectations (created any number of ways, including textual guidance or lack thereof) and prior experience with a system (of any edition).

I've lived them again and again. As a DM, as a player, and as an audience member. And I agree, 100%, I think they are absurd. <br/><br/>I don't care about edition wars but I have played with people who do and it causes a problem. I like to try to play a game as described but I will break away as needed (I used the escalation rules from Afraid when I play Dogs instead of the standard rules). But I've played with people who follow the rules to the letter and I've seen that cause problems. I've played with people who don\u2019t care about the fiction. Which is obviously a problem in this specific scenario. And I've played with people who love 4E combat so much they see skill challenges as distractions and just want to get through them asap to get back to what they love about the game. <br/><br/>But that all aside, I've played with plenty of people who don't have these issues and have rocked it in Dogs, Burning Wheel, Sorcerer, In A Wicked Age, and many other games... and they still fall under the scenario I described above. Hell, I've played 4E with people who almost never roleplay, and they also fall into the same problems. Which is why I'm left confused.<br/><br/>Let me try to get way more specific. <br/><br/>The scenario usually doesn't go down exactly as Matthew described. Usually people are describing things with the same passion they would in other games but as rounds pass, the enthusiasm slowly goes away. I don't know why that is. But I can at least try to take guesses. <br/><br/>Usually the DM describes an awesome situation. Flavorful, time is of the essence, the goal is clear, but how to approach it is flexible. Players are immersed, excited, and ready to rock! Usually we play some freeform to get into the situation before jumping right into a skill challenge. No one has a problem freeforming. Many of the people I'm talking about LARP and do some sort of art semi-professionally. So bam... skill challenge. DM describes some bad guy making threats. One of the players feels the pull to confront them with words. They try to reason with them (usually the person in question is so into the fiction they aren't looking at their skill list). DM calls for a diplomacy roll. Damn, that's not one of the player's trained skills. It's common to fail even if you try something you are good at. But the person doesn't care, negotiating feels right so they make their untrained roll. Fail. The DM will try to even describe a consequence. It's not just a failure but now the bad guy is done with negotiations. <br/><br/>We go round and round, with people being immersed in the fiction at first and after a series of failures people quickly retreat and start limiting themselves to the skills they are trained at. Ok... I'm good at Acrobatics, Heal, Religion, and Streetwise. I'm only going to describe fictional things related to those skills. But it feels forced. Sometimes someone says screw their trained skills. Their character was intimidating someone in the scene, that's what they were roleplaying so they are going to roll that. So we decide to help them. But using aid another is trivial. It almost feels like cheating. And it gets to the point where we go from complete uncertainty to us being able to almost guarantee success. But we feel lame for doing it. <br/><br/>And in terms of consequences, the next encounter is going to be whatever the next encounter is regardless if we succeed or fail the skill challenge. The impact of the skill challenge seems limited. We can succeed to get an advantage, but sometimes we get too much of an advantage that the next encounter feels too easy. But it still takes 45 minutes to play through. Except now it is less challenging. Or we can fail and go into the encounter with a disadvantage, but the encounter balance is so delicate that tipped too far we go from something that was challenging to a near total party kill. Which to me, is actually exciting. But for many others it\u2019s frustrating. Especially since combat takes so long.<br/><br/>And it's not uncommon for someone to simply fail 75% of their rolls or more. Per game, it feels like there is usually at least 1 person who fails most of their rolls. Which doesn't help matters.<br/><br/>It's not as exciting or immersive as freeform. It's way less tactical than combat. And how it fits into the bigger picture seems limited. And note, these are comments from people who love 4E combat. Not only that, they have no problem describing amazing things happening in the fiction when they use their combat powers, even if those fictional details have no systematic impact... just for pure pleasure. <br/><br/>These concerns also seem common from what I've seen in nyc's RPGA scene. So it's not just story gamers having these issues. <br/><br/>It's weird. I don't understand it. Hell, I can even make it fun for me as a player. But when many of the people around me don't seem excited, I get less excited.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222868/#Comment_222868" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T18:20:45+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  6:20PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><br/>Like, I get that the Trollbabe or IAWA mechanics are<b>more</b>fun than a skill challenge (I think they are, anyway).

That makes perfect sense to me.<br/><br/>It's not just the "X successes before Y failures" mechanic that's a problem, it seems. It's the high failure rate, skill selection, the wonkiness of helping, the purpose of the skill challenge in the context of the larger adventure -- all the related stuff that surrounds and relates to the challenge, too. I've seen some of that, especially a sensitivity about skill challenges that affect the difficulty of the following combat (either making it too easy or too hard).<br/><br/>I think this maybe goes back to that problem of D&amp;D4 not really explaining how to use skill challenges well. In terms of successful integration into the adventure, that is. You guys are really good at roleplaying and coloring up the action and all that, but the purpose of even doing the skill challenge is maybe so murky that the exercise loses its meaning.<br/><br/>I bet it's akin to that feeling when you play out a conflict in Dogs in a situation when there really wasn't a conflict. The roleplaying is there, and the system does what it does, but the whole thing feels flat and strange. Everyone's like, "Why did we do that? Bob is mad now? Is that it?" The mechanic is followed at the micro level, but the larger gameplay elements aren't clicking.<br/><br/>Am I on the right track?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222876/#Comment_222876" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T19:06:45+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  7:06PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's part of it for sure.

They almost get to it, but then they fail, so close to their goal.<br/><br/>If you want that sort of tension, "X successes before Y failures" might not be the way to go. You could have a conflict tree, or whatever it's called, instead, where each roll affects your chances on the final roll. So there's five rolls and then a final roll. Every success gives you an extra die and every failure gives you a higher target number (because making it linear, so success and failure cancel each other out, is boring). Or something similar. That will keep the tension, as you won't fail until the last minute, and no matter how successful you are, the final roll always has the possibility of screwing you over.<br/><br/>Yeah, I didn't so much answer "What kind of story is 'X successes before Y failures' good for?", but I said what kind they're NOT good for, so extrapolate from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222891/#Comment_222891" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T23:10:59+00:00" title="August  5, 2009 11:10PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or do the Morningstar thing and let every success make you less likely to win and every failure more, because "Yes, oh yeah, this is easy, FUCK!" and "Aw, no, damnit, shit, YEAH!" is interesting and fun.

Suddenly, there's a system-approved way to generate a vignette that glosses over 200 miles of overland travel through the Fire Swamp.<br/><br/>2) They let each player add some color by showing their character doing something cool, without the bulk of the full combat system.  I adhere pretty strictly to  "Each player must take a turn before any player can take a second turn".  I don't really know whether that's actually in the 4E rules or not, or whether I just cribbed it from DitV.  Either way, each player has vastly different skills that they try to apply to any given challenge, and it gives everyone a little chance to step on up and flex their creative-bullshitting chops.  Almost like a built-in Baron Munchausen minigame.<br/><br/>3) Even if nothing is really at stake in a skill challenge - ESPECIALLY if nothing is at stake - it keeps up a steady stream of points of contact with the character sheet - and thus with the player's build choices.  For me, it makes the social transitions from non-combat to combat much less jarring, because it means that d20s are constantly hitting the table no matter what is going on.<br/><br/>4) I've never had a Skill Challenge take more than ten minutes.   So the fiction stays intact and running during that little window of time when one player hits the restroom, a second person grabs a soda from the fridge, and a third is wiping down the battlemat and clearing off the dead minis.  And soon enough, we're ready for the next elaborate set piece fight scene.  Which is why we play 4E in the first place, because everyone at the table has already beaten Final Fantasy Tactics multiple times each and we're tired of waiting for sequels.  So we're rolling our own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222913/#Comment_222913" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-06T05:02:07+00:00" title="August  6, 2009  5:02AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another idea:<br/><br/>What if there's no upper limit on successes?

Been playing a lot of Burning Wheel...and failure is something to embrace.  It leads to more conflict.<br/><br/>So with that in mind.<br/><br/>1)  xp should be given no matter what the outcome.  I would suggest that folks learn more from failure than they do success.... but then again, I'm an artist by trade and failure and happy accidents are a daily occurrence.  And for real radical thought... you get MORE xp for FAILURE!... as the story has gotten more complicated.  I suggest 1/2 xp for Success... full xp for Failure.  <br/><br/>2)  No skill can be used twice in a row.  Force the players out of the box.  But with that caveat, all skills are on the table.  DMs don't get to make "a list"... as in Adam's example, Diplomacy would have been the FIRST skill I would have turned to, not one of the last and for awhile blocked.    If the PC can make a good case for how Dungeoneering works in a long contract dispute with the Assassin's Guild... cool..good on him... .roll dem dice.<br/><br/>3)   Role play first, roll dice second, adjust Role Play to the die roll/skill used.  This way the roleplaying can dictate some of the skill choices and then the addition of die roll adjudicates the roleplaying.  <br/><br/>4)  Forget the helping bonus rule.  I suggest that one can forgo their turn by giving someone a helping die immediately.  I think this promotes paying attention at the table and interconnectivity in the group and with NPCs.  There is something very tangible about sliding a die over to the guy about to make a roll and saying "I support you.  My character uses This is something I love about BW duel of wits.  I've had NPCs give helping die to one side, then the conversation turns and helping die goes to the other side as points are made.  I suggest that PC (or NPCs) can give out d8s for Trained Skills, d4s for non-Trained skills. <br/><br/>But with this idea of gathering help dice, I would suggest roll offs... not a static DC number.  The Orc King would be rolling his Diplomacy or Bluff or History, gathering help dice from his wormy sidekick priest etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222971/#Comment_222971" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-06T09:56:19+00:00" title="August  6, 2009  9:56AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that was my example, Storn. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> The way I run challenges, players can use any skill that makes sense, but they have to show me how they're using it (and it has to make sense to everyone at the table) before they roll. I may make a "list" but it's just to think through some things before getting to the table. It's not an exhaustive list.

And then?"<br/><br/>Player 2: "Uhh..."<br/>--<br/>As far as I can tell, skill challenges were tacked on to 4E at the last minute. The maths are terrible, and as many people have commented, there is no decent explanation for how skill challenges should work. Particularly if you have never read published adventures. Because the old skill rolls were throwaway, the default interpretation, therefore, is that skill challenges should likewise be throwaway. Which is sad, because similar games like Burning Wheel and Exalted have such better mechanics for non-combat action.<br/><br/>To answer the OP question, "roll x successes before y failures" is good for any damn story you please. If you can spin a single diplomacy check into a full scene with the king, rolling a few more dice along the way should not be a fearsome obstacle. In fact, the dice should help by suggesting divergent outcomes. OR, you can go the old-school, killer-DM route and tell the story of how some poor schmuck failed. Horribly. Also known as the "roll X failures in spite of Y successes" mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What kind of story is "Roll X successes before Y failures" good for? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10032/what-kind-of-story-is-roll-x-successes-before-y-failures-good-for/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content='What kind of story is "Roll X successes before Y failures" good for? - Page 2' itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10032/what-kind-of-story-is-roll-x-successes-before-y-failures-good-for/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Ooh.

If you're gonna get simmy/gamey with it, you could introduce special attributes that add automatic failures or successes to certain types of rolls. Combined with some of the other ideas in this thread, you could have a game that says something like this:\n<blockquote>Player: "I want to charm the king."<br/><br/>GM: "Okay, roll as many successes as you can before 3 failures."<br/><br/>Player: "I have a <i>Dashing Countenance</i>, so I'm already three successes ahead of the curve."<br/><br/>GM: "Awesome. Okay, roll your Charm skill."<br/><br/>Player: [Rolls 3 successes and 2 failures.]<br/><br/>GM: "Excellent roll! You now have 6 successes total. Do you want to roll again and see if you can get it even higher?"<br/><br/>Player: "And risk busting? Nah, I'm happy with 6."<br/><br/>GM: "Okay, describe how you're charming the king and 6 things that happen as a result. I'll describe 2 unfortunate things that also happen as a result, because you rolled 2 failures."<br/><br/>Player: "Alright, but I really only want him to do 3 things as a result of my action, can I save some of those successes?"<br/><br/>GM: "Sure, but you can only use those saved successes to help out other players."<br/><br/>Player: "Fair enough!"<br/><br/>[Player describes 3 things happening as a result of charming the king.]<br/></blockquote>\nGranted, I play story games in a very detached, authorial mode, and you can see that in this example, but I think it'd work for more actory games, too.<br/><br/>EDIT: OH! Had another idea. "Busting" is what happens if you get more than the maximum number of failures. But what happens after that? Your saved successes are wiped out and go towards your XP for the session. So there's actually a benefit to busting, but only in the long-term. It stings enough to want to avoid it, but is soft enough to not be a bad thing for the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223186/#Comment_223186" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T09:12:01+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  9:12AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, considering that Skill challenges are supposed to be able to be interspersed with combat either as is, or in the form of traps, I really doubt they were done at the last minute. While the original printed 2x successes x failures model does produce some odd results, the original problem with the 'killer' skill challenges seem to have been the original dc's and the main problem with those was a footnote ("for skill checks increase DC's by 5" DMG 42). Unless you want to say DC's, Monsters, and Traps were done last minute, I'm really not buying it. <br/><br/>Thinking of it, while I haven't played it, the Inspectre's bit of building up successes to some number before the case is done. As for clearly defining in one place and more advice on when exactly to use it, I admit it is not the clearest, mostly because they put the 'what is this' behind the 'how to'  I think the saying its a 'Skill Checks' for 'Multible Players' that 'Rewards Clever Ideas' and 'Has Consequences' would have been more concise, but I think its really all there on page 75-76. Not to mention the 5 examples right after it...<br/><br/>As for , practical advice, I would honestly scrap a lot of this advice that says "I will let my players do anything, if it makes sense in the context of the fiction' I really think this is noise. Those arbitrary Gm created constraints ARE THE FICTION. How many times has it been said here that 'Constraint breads creativity' or in a common real life saying 'necessity is the mother of invention' but for some reason these dont apply to skill challenges.

We didn\u2019t want a system that reduced all the intricacies of a situation to a single die roll; we also didn\u2019t want a system that failed to add to the fun of an adventure. What we did want, for the situations that called for it, was a system full of tension, drama, and risk\u2026 the very essence of any D&amp;D encounter.</blockquote>\n...Mike Mearls describes their actual play like this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Mearls</cite>As the characters travel through town, it is important that they all make an effort to keep a low profile. When the PCs take one of the actions above, each PC in the group must make a separate skill check. The group, as a whole, must have more successes than failures in order to succeed overall. Otherwise, the group fails (including on a tie).<br/><br/>The PCs can each use a different skill, provided each skill is allowable for that action. Each PC can also aid one other PC. One PC can receive aid from more than one ally.</blockquote>\nThat's not an out-of-the-book Skill Challenge. I don't know what that is exactly, but it's pretty clear that whatever system they were actually using and the system they printed are not the same thing. So yeah, while it's clear that they wanted Skill Challenge rules in the book from the get-go, it is also clear that the actual procedures they use at the table are not the same thing as what they put in the book. They're not rolling multiple times each. They don't have the X successes before Y failures model, where X+Y is significantly greater than the number of PCs. They have different Aid Another rules. They have allowed and un-allowed skills rather than, "oh, snap, diplomacy is an auto-fail, bitch!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223195/#Comment_223195" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T10:12:26+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 10:12AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I rarely run skill challenges because I think the mechanic is only for certain situations.

I'm not quite sure how much we've drifted the rules from what's actually written, but it certainly feels like we're doing it the way that's intended. <br><br>We did one a while back that involved sneaking into a fortified house that was being patrolled by guards with dogs. We had to clock up 5(?) successes to get across the grounds and into the house. If we clocked up 3(?) failures, the guards would have spotted us instead. We just took it in turns to make up some way of furthering our goals and roll the relevant skill.

I really don't see how such cookie-cutter puzzle-piece mechanics do anything but further disengage everyone from the story by engaging them further in the ever-more-omnipresent mechanics. There's nothing being done here that couldn't be done in less time, and with more engagement, by having the GM simply narrate the experience and ask for a few skill checks along the way. The only way I could see something like this being helpful is if:<br/><br/>1) You think the GM is going to cheat, and you want him to be locked down to specific mechanics along the way to ensure balance and fairness.<br/><br/>2) The GM doesn't like to, or is inexperienced at, improvising and narrating a story, and refereeing situations on the fly.<br/><br/>Absent one of those two situations, I don't see why a GM would prefer to tie his or her hands in such a way. In any game. This doesn't only disengage players, but at this point it's disengaging the GM. In fact, you don't even need a GM at this point, because the players can just shift the cards around all by themselves.<br/><br/>I can see this being engaging on a MECHANICAL level, but on a story level? That's very hard to believe.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223698/#Comment_223698" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T12:48:19+00:00" title="August 10, 2009 12:48PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see how this ties the GM's hands or makes the skill challenge boring.

The problem with Skill Challenges is that the mechanics are generally regarded as exceptionally poor. Lots of people do just fine with lifepaths, even though they are "locked down to specific mechanics along the way to ensure balance and fairness", forcing players to "tie his or her hands in such a way". Story is an emergent property of rpgs and can happen for many reasons. I find 4E's aggressively inclusive style interesting and refreshing, excepting when the rules should have gone through additional rounds of playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223741/#Comment_223741" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T14:59:12+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  2:59PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh noes the story...<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael...play something else dude.  4E is a celebration of the fiddly bits.

Our group's wizard is sometimes able to get +2 to his rolls with his "cantrips."

Too long for me to bother reading all of it, so apologies if this has already been mentioned.<br/><br/>The problem with "X successes before Y failures" from a story point of view is that most stories we're used to succeed or fail at the last moment. If the movie has a tragic ending, it's not when they're halfway to the goal. They almost get to it, but then they fail, so close to their goal.<br/><br/>If you want that sort of tension, "X successes before Y failures" might not be the way to go. You could have a conflict tree, or whatever it's called, instead, where each roll affects your chances on the final roll. So there's five rolls and then a final roll. Every success gives you an extra die and every failure gives you a higher target number (because making it linear, so success and failure cancel each other out, is boring). Or something similar. That will keep the tension, as you won't fail until the last minute, and no matter how successful you are, the final roll always has the possibility of screwing you over.<br/><br/>Yeah, I didn't so much answer "What kind of story is 'X successes before Y failures' good for?", but I said what kind they're NOT good for, so extrapolate from there.</blockquote>\nThis reminds me totally of how Donjon works. If you succeed at sneaking up behind someone, rather than declaring that you sneaked up, you add those dice to your following attack roll, meaning you're going to end up doing massively more damage. That points to a good design for this kind of thing, versus D&amp;D not having a good design for it. If you have to think this hard how to make it work, it's not that useful of a mechanic. I suppose with a game as popular as 4e it might be necessary to figure out how to really introduce them well, but part of the issue I see is that it just shifts probabilities.<br/><br/>If you need to do a skill challenge with 5 successes before 3 failures, and the skill you're using has a 75% chance of success each time, you're taking a 75% chance and turning it into close to 100%, since averaged out it'll be success, success, success, fail, success, success. Even if you start with the fail it's fail, success, success, success, fail, success, success. With a skill that has a 75% chance of success against the target difficulty, with 6 successes, 2 failures, you've changed it to a 50% chance of success overall. Does that end up really making sense? 'Cause when you have a system that doesn't make sense mathematically, it's hard to justify roleplaying with it when the outcome isn't likely to be what the numbers on your character sheet suggest they should be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224380/#Comment_224380" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T19:16:29+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  7:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/eric">@eric</a> et al, <br/><br/>All i can say is, I really think you are committed to saying something like 9/10 of the book is tacked on if you want to say that skill challenges are.

I was silly to try to establish a point by looking at what the designers have publicly said. The fact that the math is borked on the skill challenges in the books in very basic and simple ways is obviously not an indication that they were poorly thought-out. And the fact that the cleric power list alone takes up more pages than skill challenges is a clear indication that the skill challenge rules make up a majority of the system - 9/10, even.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/smathis" title="smathis"><img alt="smathis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/smathis">smathis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224861/#Comment_224861" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T12:28:00+00:00" title="August 15, 2009 12:28PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had Skill Challenges go across the board from really awesome scenes or a series of scenes that move the narrative forward to mechanical speedbumps that just sort of throw everyone off. The discussions regarding Skill Challenges remind of the discussions around HeroQuest 1.0's Extended Contests back on the Forge. And to a degree a lot of the advice from one bleeds over into the other.<br/><br/>Not everything should be a Skill Challenge. Or needs to be. Skill Challenges should, perhaps, be the 4e equivalent of Bringing Down the Pain in tSoY. Skill Challenges are also easier to comprehend in the context of broader spans of time. For example, my Skill Challenge to break into an ancient tomb would've probably been best served as a single roll. But my Skill Challenge to seduce a noble woman was spot on, primarily because each "round" in the Skill Challenge was spread out across a more organic timespan than round-to-round.<br/><br/>This is all stuff I'm still learning by trial-and-error. And I agree that the what-to-do-with-it portion of Skill Challenges in the DMG were pretty weak. But there's bones there that can provide a framework for fun. Especially for the story-gamer types.<br/><br/>Some things I've tried to do that have met with success...\n<ul>\n<li>Adam's advice about prompting the player's to roleplay what they're doing before announcing which skill they use is spot on. My players know, or should, that a good enough roleplay is grounds for an automatic success. And a bad one an automatic failure. Players only roll when the outcome is in question. And the DM decides the skill. But backtracking is fine.</li>\n<li>The Aid Another rules work great in combat because you are effectively sacrificing a standard action to give someone else a +2. In a skill challenge, there's no real cost for that. So I've been using a different mechanic in Skill Challenges for aiding someone else. Mainly, the DC is set as usual. When the player rolls a success earns a +1. Every +5 points above the DC gives them another +1. Every -5 points below the DC is a -1. But failing by less than -5 doesn't do anything. That's worked a lot better than the bog standard +2 for rolling over a 10</li>\n<li>I like the idea of using successes and failures in a narrative fashion ala Donjon. But I haven't gotten a D&amp;D group to bite on that one yet.</li>\n<li>I also like the idea of rising/falling tension suggested by Morningstar's flipping of success/fail. In my experience, though, I think the best way to do that would be to have each success increase the DC of subsequent rolls and each failure lower them. Maybe +/- 2. That right there could go a long way towards giving Skill Challenges a tension that they sometimes start missing in play.</li>\n</ul>\nThat's all.

It's not necessarily the type of story but the scale in which it is applied to the story. The example included is a rough overview of how the plot went in Beowulf, going something like pass, pass, fail, pass, fail, pass, pass, pass, fail, pass. As I wrote that I noticed that fail right at the end before the pass is a pretty standard trope. So a better way to re-image it might be to focus on the failures rather than the passes. Have the challenge expect a certain number of failures (probably with a bit of a range, say 2-4), and once the last failure, or the key one comes up, have the final check be for the overall event, essentially seeing how they come back from a set back, with the previous successes contributing to how well they do in the final test.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224981/#Comment_224981" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T03:44:06+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  3:44AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>So a better way to re-image it might be to focus on the failures rather than the passes.

Now that's the kind of stuff I was hoping to hear! So it sounds like this is almost a one-roll arc for a whole session. You'd make this roll at the beginning of the session and follow each plot point each round until the end of the session. You know from the beginning that you're going to fail in the first round, fail in the second round, pass in the third, fail in the fourth, but pass in the fifth and last round. If that's the case, I wonder what the actual in-the-moment random element would be, if any is necessary.<br/><br/>Perhaps random consequences, independent of passing or failing? So a consequence could be "the town praises you as a hero," but that has far different implications if they praise you as a hero after a <i>failure</i> rather than a success.<br/><br/>Perhaps the actual task itself is random, like a bunch of tests written on separate cards that you draw from for each turn. You know at any point that you will fail or pass, but you don't know what you're going to fail <i>at</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224982/#Comment_224982" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T04:12:38+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  4:12AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, what you could end up setting up is certain situations where failure unknowingly moves them along. For instance, you could have a storm the villain's stronghold type scenario. To get from the outside in is much too difficult for the characters to succeed, but from the inside it's a lot easier. There are any number of things they could succeed at, such as taking out several patrols, sneaking around some others, etc, and if they fail perhaps they're just driven back, but eventually they hit a point where the odds are overwhelming, they're beaten, unable to retreat, and captured. They're thrown into jail inside the villain's stronghold, have to fight their way out (potentially with other prisoners who want to just leave through the sewers) but instead of fighting their way out, they go back to their task of beating the villain. <br/><br/>Another example could be a mentor type who at any point that the PCs fail at something obvious to a lot of people (or maybe just a few) the mentor steps in and offers help, considering the failure to be a valuable experience to shape the characters. It could even be a different mentor depending on what is failed, but regardless, whichever one they get they get some sort of valuable information or improvement to allow them to finish. It would be a bit contrived to do it with every failure, but perhaps throw a number of challenges at the PCs, and whichever one that they failed the worst at gets the mentor looking at them improving them specifically in that aspect so for the final challenge they're more prepared and well rounded than if they were to have succeeded at each point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226477/#Comment_226477" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T07:54:02+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  7:54AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just had another thought for dice mechanics where it would somehow seem less contrived in a more fixed skill challenge like is being talked about.<br/><br/>Go to a dice pool system that uses poker dice, with the trick to get a hand of a certain value with a certain number of tries. You start rolling, and maybe you get a pair and everything else is unconnected, you then decide if you keep the pair to try bringing it to 3 of a kind and 4 of a kind on retries, or if you re-roll entirely. If you're sticking with your hand and only re-rolling a few dice, it suggests you're going to keep going at the angle you've started with, if you're completely switching gears and re-rolling everything, you have to say what you're changing about your approach. <br/><br/>You could also do it with cards, but have the GM take the discarded cards and see what kind of hand he can make with it, so the trick is to make your hand of a certain level or higher, before the GM can construct a better hand from the cards you threw away. <br/><br/>It puts something of a game back into it, and makes things more alive, rather than asking for a bunch of rolls (which could really be handled, if it's 5 successes before 3 failures, by throwing 8d20 and seeing if 5 or more beat the skill challenge rank, and be done with it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226532/#Comment_226532" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T11:11:09+00:00" title="August 21, 2009 11:11AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>which could really be handled, if it's 5 successes before 3 failures, by throwing 8d20 and seeing if 5 or more beat the skill challenge rank, and be done with it</blockquote>I *think* that the math is wrong there, because how would you know (say) that you didn't roll the three failures on rolls 1, 2, and 3?

If yes, stop. If no, is not winning the same as losing? If yes, reroll. The fact that the GM also gets to reroll is tactically moot if I can't win at all without rerolling.<br/><br/>So you're challenge for a tactically interesting game would be to add some extra bits in there to gum it up some more. One way is to make the GM not win by default - some kind of 'split the odds' outcome.<br/><br/>Regarding the card implementation, the Paizo 'Second Darkness' adventure series has a game called Golem that works like migo describes. You play draw poker. At the end, the winner only rakes the pot if he also beats the best 5-card hand assembled from everyone's discards - the 'golem' hand. If the golem hand wins, the pot is added to the next round's ante. Note that this can really hose someone who goes all-in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226599/#Comment_226599" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T18:54:42+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  6:54PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>You could also do it with cards, but have the GM take the discarded cards and see what kind of hand he can make with it, so the trick is to make your hand of a certain level or higher, before the GM can construct a better hand from the cards you threw away.</blockquote>\nNow that is a curious idea indeed.

It could always be comparing height times width and see which one has the largest sum too.<br/><br/>I'm thinking with anything like this you'd need a maximum number of re-rolls or re-draws, indicating how skilled or capable you are, or how long the challenge is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226654/#Comment_226654" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T07:05:48+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  7:05AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had another thought:<br/><br/>This system could actually work for a game where you're an engineer on the starship Enterprise.
