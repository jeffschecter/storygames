Then again, British humor is subtle, and reading his blog has made me realize he's proud to be a nerd. Huh. My American lenses didn't get that from reading the book.<br/><br/>Anyway, the most curious, and saddest part, of the book so far is this paragraph on page 139-140:<br/><br/>"D&amp;D is, I believe, something virtually unique and unprecedented in human history. It's a story you can listen to at the same time as telling it. You can be surprised by the plot's twists and turns, but you can surprise too. It's more interactive than any other sort of narrative I can think of. If its subject matter were more serious then it would be considered a new art form, and it's probably surprising that nothing beyond murder mystery dinners has ever been evolved from it. This is why D&amp;D is so addictive when it's played right. It's like the best story you've ever read combined with the charge a good storyteller feels as he plays his audience."<br/><br/>The part that's kind of sad is, <b>If its subject matter were more serious then it would be considered a new art form, and it's probably surprising that nothing beyond murder mystery dinners has ever been evolved from it.</b><br/><br/>First: I wish he'd known about Forgie-ish* games.<br/><br/>Second: I wish he'd done some research before writing that sentence!<br/><br/>*bad form, I know. Can we not debate how inappropriate/false this term is in this thread?

Because as far as I can tell, the takeaway message is that D&amp;D is ultimately bad for you because it interferes with the natural process of learning to sit down, shut up, and expect less from your life.

I just thought I was poking gentle fun at myself, not crying about a terrible childhood. I didn\u2019t have a terrible childhood, I was broadly happy, although I was a ridiculous idiot.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239021/#Comment_239021" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T17:54:38+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  5:54PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite><br/>EDIT: posted on the author's blog, pointing him to Grey Ranks, Breaking the Ice, Steal Away Jordan, and Dogs in the Vineyard.</blockquote>He's writing a Viking fantasy novel.

I thought it was a sad book, but not because of the author's attitude toward D&amp;D, but because of the adolescent tragedy it contains: wrongheaded self-delusion, losing your best friend over a game-related argument--all the self-involved high drama of being a teenager. When I read it, I was reminded of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594489580" rel="nofollow">The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</a></i>: both are stories about desperately unhappy teenagers whose obsession with role-playing games is depicted as an ultimately debilitating coping mechanism for their alienation from the real world, which can be recognized by the presence of girls. It's like the Flashlight Brown song, "Ready to Roll": <i>We may not know any girls, but we got graph paper guiding the way.</i> Of course, "Ready to Roll" is redeemed by a chorus that I choose to regard as sincerely if somewhat self-mockingly felt: <i><b>That was </b></i>by far<i> the best time that we ever had!</i> <br/><br/>What other examples of this kind of geekish self-loathing are out there?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241988/#Comment_241988" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-14T23:30:49+00:00" title="November 14, 2009 11:30PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite>posted on the author's blog, pointing him to Grey Ranks, Breaking the Ice, Steal Away Jordan, and Dogs in the Vineyard.</blockquote>\nSo Mark Barrowcliffe responded to my post.
