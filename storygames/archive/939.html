                    Some of you may remember <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Charles_the_Bald.php" rel="nofollow">Charles the Bald is Superf***ed</a>*, my entry for the 2005 Iron Game Chef competition. I've been playing it a lot lately, and I'm thrilled. Here's why.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, it's smooth. It works just the way it's supposed to, which makes me immensely proud as a game designer.<br/>
<br/>
Second, it's taught me a lot about player feedback in groups. In CtB, every turn, you award other players tokens for their stories, and you have to tell them why. In some groups, this is used spontaneously and just for kicks, which results in over-the-top stories where players compete to come up with hilarious and shocking episodes. In other groups, players use this feedback actively to make each other better storytellers. So in some groups, players might go: "That was cool when that guy's head exploded!", while in others, they say: "I liked how you used that flashback scene to show the king's motivation". After just one round, there's a group consensus about what stories should be like.<br/>
<br/>
(Has anybody heard about the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forming-storming-norming-performing" rel="nofollow">forming, storming, norming, performing</a> model of team development? That's <i>exactly</i> what goes on in CtB).<br/>
<br/>
Third, win conditions and rules <i>encourage</i> good storytelling. It's very easy to make games where you have to choose between telling a good story and trying to actually win. In CtB, you get a good score only if other players agree your story's <i>good</i>. If you try to get away with rubbish just to place tokens on the map - you'll lose <i>hard</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, it's a great channeling game, where one sort of desire/motivation is channeled by the rules into a very different form of behavior. Players come to the table with a desire to win. That desire is channeled by the rules into story-telling behavior. (I like channeling; it's both theoretically interesting and practically useful).<br/>
<br/>
Fifth, it keeps challenging you, every turn. The cards say whose story you're telling, and how it has to end; the board tactics give you choices about where the story should take place; and the group consensus says what sort of stories will work in this group. These are all creative constraints, none of which are easily predictable. There's no planning - it's your turn, now <i>go!</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Sixth, people are giving me all <i>sorts</i> of feedback. From wanting to take home the playtest versions, to giving me good advice on further development, to having <i>dreams</i> about the game and incorporating bits into their own designs.<br/>
<br/>
This last part is how I really know I'm on to something. Plagiarism doesn't lie.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>* Note: The version currently on the web isn't up-to-date. The most important changes are that schtick narration has been removed, and there are only five or six locations on the board. Anyone interested in a newer version, contact me.</i> </div>

                            Now. I want to play this with some people online, because I think it would kick ass. However, it's not the easiest game to play online. It has a map, with tokens; you need to keep track of your tokens, and what tokens are where on the map. You also need IRC or similar to tell the stories, and say who you vote for each turn.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on how to do this? Any sites/programs where you can upload a game board and let people place tokens on it, or something?                        </div>

                            Have you checked out <a href="http://gametable.galactanet.com/" rel="nofollow">Gametable</a>? It's a java program that pretty much does exactly that, plus a bunch of other things. It may be more than you need, but it's worth a shot.                        </div>

                            Here's a tool that might work for you; a friend of mine hacked it up.<br><br><a href="http://soy.dyndns.org/~jes5199/im-so-board" rel="nofollow">I'm so board</a><br><br>Slap it onto a server of your own and then play with it a bit and you'll see how it works. With a bit of HTML wisdom you can rejigger it to use any graphics you'd like.

                            Gametable doesn't let you use your own board, as far as I can tell; and I can't get "I'm so board" to work - I can activate &amp; click "Create piece", but nothing happens. (Invalid argument on line 394, apparently). I could code something in Flash/PHP, but I don't really need the extra work...<br/>
