I've got some long sheets of paper on my wall here, with post-it notes describing different plot things and other stuff I might want in there. It's looking like a good way to plan. (I do wish I had someone else to explain it all to, though, but no hurry yet).<br/><br/>It got me thinking: This is one tool. And we have lots of tools for making cool stories. I could, for instance...<br/><br/>- Play out little scenes using specific resolution methods. Say the protagonist is hunting/being hunted through the forest, and I get some friends to draw resolution cards to see what happens?<br/>- Use something Microscope-like to zoom in and out on different parts of the plot.<br/>- Make a map of the area with A Thousand Years Under The Sun to get some history (although I'd have to scale the turns very differently).<br/>- Do some experiments with shuffling the post-it-notes and placing them in a different order, just to see what emerges.<br/><br/>The basic constraint is that I want to keep some control over the plot (so I don't want tools that just make a whole different story). But that might actually just be a darling to kill, who knows.<br/><br/><b>Have you ever used different techniques for writing books?<br/><br/>Do you have any cool ideas for games or techniques that could be used? </b><br/><br/>(All replies are welcome, even if not directly related to the questions!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396908/#Comment_396908" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-09T09:28:44+00:00" title="November  9, 2012  9:28AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2012 9:33AM by Burr.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, what interests me most is the idea of the technique letting you keep control of the plot while generating other aspects of story.  It seems like most traditional RPGs take characters as inputs, offer mechanics for controlling plot, and output theme, while most story-games are theme-&gt;characters-&gt;plot.  I wonder if a game might just as well take your plot as input, offer mechanics for controlling theme, and output characters.  (And then then you could run the characters through a traditional rpg to get theme.  Then use a story-game game to do theme-&gt;characters-&gt;plot.  And then start over.  It would be iterative design.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396909/#Comment_396909" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-09T09:36:19+00:00" title="November  9, 2012  9:36AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2012 9:37AM by Burr.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as the actual writing goes, the simple answer is to write each thing as it happens in the game, while the inspiration is there.

When GMing, you have to build conflict and then walk away. The Players get to resolve it, and usually they are going to take the most random and disjointed method of resolving it. Also there is a random element in games that lead to anticlimax and stymie the resolution process. all of this works for game and not for books. <br/><br/>Kind of random, but I hope it helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397089/#Comment_397089" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-11T11:09:11+00:00" title="November 11, 2012 11:09AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd also mention that the types of conflict that are interesting and fun to play through in a game and the types of conflict that are interesting and fun to read about in a book do not have 100% overlap.  E.g., you might be able to kill off the protagonist's best friend to demonstrate a point in a book, but in a game, a PC will likely want to die for something besides making a point about another PC.  (That said, that scenario isn't impossible in a game or anything, and certainly doesn't apply to something w/o character ownership ala Universalis or Microscope.)<br/><br/>I would wager that as a writer, just peg yourself as editor, and if when you write out the random results from the game and you have a way better idea in mind and wish things would have gone that way instead, well, trust your gut and change it.  On the other hand, writing purely under the constraints of the random system is a pretty interesting challenge if you hardlined and stuck only to the random results, and good things could come out of there too.<br/><br/>I think something like Annalise's claims mechanic would be pretty neat for writing, but you'd have to hack it a bit.  I've only played Universalis and not Microscope yet, but I think working something like claims into a game of that style wouldn't be impossible.  Essentially simply incentivizing recurring themes and the like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397093/#Comment_397093" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-11T11:47:15+00:00" title="November 11, 2012 11:47AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Writer's Dice and StoryForge cards come to mind! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/countercheck" title="countercheck"><img alt="countercheck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/countercheck">countercheck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397094/#Comment_397094" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-11T11:51:35+00:00" title="November 11, 2012 11:51AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2012 11:52AM by countercheck.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I write, and a few other writers I know feel the same way, I rarely have any idea of the plot.  I just have a couple of voices in my head in a situation, and I let them talk, and write down what they say, and see where it goes.  Kinda like Fiasco, really.  And then I take the material I've verbally vomited out, and shape it into something, looking for holes, or things which need to be cut.  <br/><br/>For my money, the most useful RPG tools would be AW Fronts and BW BITs.  Story is about the characters, and giving them really powerful, contradictory desires makes them compelling, giving them little details that speak volumes about who they are makes them human, and having events that will proceed unless they get in the way gives them something to struggle against.  Seriously.  Write like a BW GM, throw horrible things at your characters, and see how they make it through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397099/#Comment_397099" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-11T13:31:55+00:00" title="November 11, 2012  1:31PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While not exactly a game technique, I did borrow a concept from IAWA of pointing characters' best interests at each other in order to create a starting situation for a novel.<br/><br/>Also, the design of my game <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">Final Hour of a Storied Age</a> was partially inspired by the concept of writing outlines for novels (the common Forge model of games is to create an emergent plot by banging heavily defined characters into each other, which I thought sounded similar to the "discovery writing" process of writing fiction, but there's also an outline-writing school of thought among fiction-writers and I wanted to explore that in game design). For NaNoWriMo 2009 I actually used an early version of my game to sketch out an outline for me. It wasn't a <i>great</i> novel when I stopped at 50k words but it wasn't worthless, either (the game has also improved since then, although I haven't tried the experiment again).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397104/#Comment_397104" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-11T14:08:04+00:00" title="November 11, 2012  2:08PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Phillip K Dick wrote The Man in The High Castle using Tarot cards (or the I Ching?

I'm currently alpha testing an online system I created for writing and playing story\xa0games.  It's called VORPS.  You create a reusable "sourcebook" that describes the setting, and then you play games in which one player is the narrator (GM) and the other players are the story's characters (PCs).  The whole thing unfolds as a collaborative narrative that is mediated by the game system.<br/><br/>I've had several professional writers tell me that it would be a good tool for using game mechanics to assemble a written story and ultimately a completed work.  The concept fascinates me, but no one has actually tried it yet.  Anyone wanna be the first?

It was kinda railroady, and I made stuff happen that suited my longtime plans, and also that suited my instantaneous decisions on what was appropriate.  For the latter, I would never have come to those decisions without the reality of play.<br/><br/>Since I did not exercise total authority over what happened -- the players did get to make <i>some</i> important choices -- there were a lot of paths not taken.  Stuff in the back of my head stayed there, waiting for an outlet.<br/><br/>Inspired by setting-rich games like Cyberpunk 2020, I saw world history as an important part of the game.  I did all the classic "showing off my cool world" GM stuff.  I wrote timelines of the ages of the world and found ways to work them into play.  I made the gods and the legendary figures of history come out and touch the events of the campaign.  The players wound up pitted against the apocalyptic lord of darkness, who became, in my mind, the story's true protagonist.<br/><br/>This package of ideas and factoids and flavors and themes stuck with me, serving as a subtler backdrop for a game I GMed in college.  It was no longer about the evil god, but his story stayed fresh in my mind.<br/><br/>When I graduated college, I had enough material for a 190,000-word novel.<br/><br/>Finding ways to take the stories in my head and make them matter to my friends in spoken form -- this turned out to be great practice for presenting similar stories in written form.  Spending time in the world of my stories, moving through it with friends, also made that world more real and vivid to me, and made me care more about what happened in it.<br/><br/>If I wanted to write a short novel now, I'd probably:<br/>1) finish designing an RPG that supports strong player interaction with pre-plotted GMing<br/>2) outline the events of a short campaign<br/>3) play the game through to the end<br/>4) write a new outline, play that, and repeat until I knew my novel's basic structure (especially the ending!)<br/>5) bang out a first draft without stopping, based purely on my inspiration from the previous steps<br/><br/>I imagine that none of this is actually a good idea, at least not the way I've presented it, but hopefully there's a useful nugget in there somewhere...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397462/#Comment_397462" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T08:02:00+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  8:02AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2012 8:03AM by lizziestark.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a technique for revision, very useful for all types of writing. You can use it for chapters, or for a whole book. (use chapters instead of scenes...or rent out a ballroom and put up ALL THE SCENES.) I use it for nonfiction, but it's made for fiction. The re-typing is particularly golden IMO.<br/><br/>1. Take whatever part of the story you're working on right now, and cut it into scene and narrative summary. If scenes or bits of summary go over the page break, tape things together. Number them at the top of the paper so you can see what the original order of scenes is.<br/><br/>2. Hang your story on the wall, starting with the first scene on the left, and the last scene on the right. You can do things with the height of the story. For example, if you have a flashback scene, put it lower. If you have a flash forward scene, put it higher. If it's an imagined scene, put it really high on the wall.<br/><br/>3. Look at the comparative lengths of the parts. Usually, well-written stuff will have some visual rhythm and some variety in how long the scenes are. <br/><br/>4. You can highlight the first places that a character or concept appears in different colors of highlighter, which helps think about when you are introducing critical information. Content-wise, does the chapter focus on the thing you want it to focus on?<br/><br/>5. Write post-it notes for missing scenes, characters, and concepts and stick them on the wall. You can also use these to help loosen the narrative by adding narrative detritus -- there are examples of scenes that often work in the book -- missed phone calls, imagined scenes, conversations with wait staff, etc.<br/><br/>6. Move around the pieces of the story and the post-its until you feel that they're right. You can move things around in time, fuse two similar scenes together to make things more temporally contiguous, etc. <br/><br/>7. Re-number your pieces of paper. One by one, sit down at the computer and re-type the scenes without block moving. Because when you re-type you re-commit yourself to every word. And the words will inexorably change and get better because you won't want to re-type crappy sentences.<br/><br/>8.
