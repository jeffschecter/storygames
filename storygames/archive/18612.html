I was very nervous going in, I had no idea if we would be able to hold a plot together or keep things moving, but I was pleasantly surprised! The game more ended up like a crazy, sci-fi Fiasco game, but hey, we had a plot and it all resolved wonderfully. A summary is below, and we also filmed it in high quality. I'll put a link at the bottom, with a little explanation of our youtube channel. <br/><br/>-We played on Oaks Two, a planet with intelligent life and dangerously fluctuating temperatures. <br/>-Our colony was the starving Iku Pya, so we already had a lot of danger to work off of.<br/><br/>We very quickly established that the intelligent life was a sort of state-changing gelatinous creature, that turned to cement during the freezing parts of the day and was dangerously spry and aggressive in heat. Many an adventurer has died, foot buried into a frozen "Jelly." <br/><br/>Play started out with the Dimber Damber unintentionally running into a crawler, who had come into possession of "The Hypercybe," a glow, yet-unestablished artifact of some great importance. Samson, our maguffin crawler, escapes with the hypercube, and the Dimber Damber begins to plot as to how he will retrieve it.<br/><br/>Next, our rough and tumble Governor called a marine into his office to give him a special mission- the hypercube was missing, and the authority wanted to make sure it was returned before the convicts found out. The marine was sent out on the mission.<br/><br/>The corrupt captain of the marines met with our suave bolter, who revealed that he desperately needed a pair of Jellies for his own nefarious purposes. The bolter promised him his jellies, but at a stiff price.<br/><br/>Further scenes developed, and we learned that the hypercube contains critical information for tuning and running the nutrition vats, which has been the whole source of the food shortage throughout the game. We also learn that the Governor and the Dimber Damber have some past, tense relationship, and view their interaction much like a game.<br/><br/>In one pivotal scene, where the marine was reporting to the Governor his findings about the whereabouts of the cube (it was being taken out on a sail barge across Popcorn Canyon, at the behest of a few other characters) we learn the Governor is actually quite insane, and is obsessed with the vats - so much so he plans on taking matters into his own hands.<br/><br/>Our game ended with almost all the characters on a climactic sale barge fight. Jellies attacked the boat, characters were offing each other left and right and Samson, the crazy crawler with the hypercube, ended up holding the mast of the sail barge up in a desperate attempt to save our lives. Taking advantage of this, the clever bolter grabbed the cube and made off for an escape raft.<br/><br/>He was the only survivor. <br/><br/>Interestingly enough, we found ourselves only using the uncertainty mechanic once throughout the whole game. I'm not sure if this was to the detriment of our game our not, or was a function of our collective inexperience in story games. I believe a few more games of Durance will reveal this.<br/><br/>Here is the first part of video for our session, the set up:<br/> <span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-hbtXDgCFRfU?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbtXDgCFRfU"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/hbtXDgCFRfU/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/><br/>The rest of the videos are up on our channel youtube.com/tabletoptalk<br/><br/>Our youtube channel has two primary goals. One, we want to act as "evangelists" for the hobby as a whole- bringing in video gamers, etc. Second, we also want to draw traditional role players into the exciting world of story games. Durance is one of our first steps into part two of the "plan," and the response has been very positive so far! I took some queues from Geek and Sundry for the editing, and I am very happy how it turned out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
