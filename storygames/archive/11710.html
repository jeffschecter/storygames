It will be all night long, so the game will last about 9-10 hours, including presenting the system and the characters (which I think, with Sorcerer, will be less than an hour). It will be a on-shot and I'll make pre-made characters for 4 players.<br/>\nCould you possibly advise me on the preparation of the session ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the idea to make them escape a scientist government facility where they were kept, then being hunted, they meet a street/terrorist cabal which they join and then a Mission/Pawn story lead to another escape and the end in a great climax (redemption/madness).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut such a planning seems to be opposed to a Sorcerer (and hence Schism) game preparation. I have the feeling of writing the story (Story Before) instead of enabling the story. Ron say that Relation Maps and associated Bangs are better, but for such a long session, I can't make sure that they will stay with the same characters, so the NPC map could be useless and the planned Bangs could become non-pertinent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the Sorcerer system isn't illusionist in design, the conflict result can have very disturbing (planning-wise) consequences, and the GM can't change the dice result (this is not a flaw, in the contrary). Problems I've thought about :<br/>\nIf they are re-captured by the government, what could be the following Bangs ? Another escape ? Pretty boring and redundant. And all the street NPCs I prepared are then useless ?<br/>\nIf they don't want to join the street gang, what will the Mission/Pawn stories become (and again, all the NPCs I prepared) ?<br/>\nIf the Pawn story don't make all of the characters want to escape, how to manage a separated group ?<br/>\nSince it's a one-shot and the spirit of the game is inescapable death, I'd like to make an end with a death scenario for each of the PC, but if we run out of time, or Humanity stay too high, won't the end be tasteless ?<br/>\n<br/>\nMore generally, how do you prepare a Schism game ?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261133/#Comment_261133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T06:05:43+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  6:05AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, you gotta not plan this stuff out and let it happen in play. Don't have the players' deaths engineered. Don't come in with an ending for them in mind. Let it happen moment to moment. I once killed a character by fiat in a Sorcerer game and it left a really sour taste in my players' mouths.<br/><br/>The way to make sure the NPC map is not useless is connect it to the NPCs the players have written on the back of their character sheet. Connect those people to the NPC map, who are already connected to the PCs.<br/><br/>If at some point you find yourself having to scrap your bangs, request a five minute OJ break and write up a handful of new ones. Adapt in play. Everything you sit down to the table with will not survive meeting the characters in play.<br/><br/>Speaking of - you're talking about having them escape a government facility, but what are their Kickers? Play should start there.<br/><br/>If they are recaptured by the government, there are tons of possibilities for Bangs but I'd have to know more about the characters to make suggestions. I imagine they will have their own agenda. If they want to escape then clearly it's not boring and redundant, it's what the players want to do.<br/><br/>If you have to manage a separate group just bounce between players between scenes. Sorcerer works really well for characters who are not an "adventuring party."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nocker" title="Nocker"><img alt="Nocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://sites.google.com/site/angrynocker/_/rsrc/1306682518924/jdr/images.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nocker">Nocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261362/#Comment_261362" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T17:22:42+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  5:22PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't a "death by fiat" in mind, but only a pacing and planning that make possible the death-scenario (which is a big part of Schism) in a single session. Would it be possible, since the players can play Humanists, making the endgame climax go away ?<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the NPC relation map, what bothered me was the desire I had to make the characters escaping from a government facility, where they were kept a long time, so they would not have any outside conections. But it seems to me that it would make the game less satisfying, and the characters would be too relying on the "party".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Kicker I thought about was an event that make them all escape NOW from the facility.

A character with a connection to a wife he has not seen in 15 years -- and who believes he has died and has since remarried -- is still a potent and useful connection, full of dramatic possibility.

My success was mixed, but here are some thoughts.<br/><br/>- Listen to what everyone is saying about having players write their own Kickers; I think it's key to the whole Sorcerer experience.  Remember that writing them doesn't require any tremendous amount of rules-knowledge or time.<br/><br/>- What I did was: I "statted out" PCs beforehand.  They had powers, names, and attributes, so that we didn't spend a lot of time with the "catalog."  Players came up with Descriptors (from the list) and Kickers.  I told them the basic starting situation - "you're all in an institution, and served in some sort of war" and they came up with Kickers that made sense in that context.  You don't need to start with a *total* blank slate.<br/><br/>- On that point, you can sort of half-bake NPCs, situations, etc.  Come up with partly-defined things, then, when everyone is done customizing, take that 15 minute break and tie them in to what the players came up with.  Someone's kicker is that his estranged daughter has come down with cancer and now she's after him for answers?  Cool... no reason she can't also be that MI-5 assassin you wanted to have in the game (but don't let the bits you come up with overshadow the bits the players come up with).  Especially if you want to *start* everyone together, half-baking can be helpful - e.g., you know you want the game to start with a prison break, so you then tie the chance to break out to whatever else they wanted to do.<br/><br/>- More than worries about system, etc., I found getting everyone on the same page with respect to *tone* to be a serious issue.  I had one player come up with the kicker, "Someone stole my favorite sock and I'm really upset about it!"  That character became a piece of grit in the works of the whole table, because it led in irredeemably silly directions.  I should have sat down with her for a sec and said, "Really, you signed up for the game about body horror and psychic powers and you want to look for a missing sock?  Change it or tell me why something that trivial is important to you."  Player-driven games don't mean that the GM has to be passive and nonjudgmental.  If *players* aren't both invested in the character's goals and the horrors they need to use to achieve them, Sorcerer can fall pretty flat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nocker" title="Nocker"><img alt="Nocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://sites.google.com/site/angrynocker/_/rsrc/1306682518924/jdr/images.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nocker">Nocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261705/#Comment_261705" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T13:25:02+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  1:25PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2010 2:02PM by Nocker.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No party... at all ???

He pitches this to the Players. If the Players like the pitch, move on to next step. (Judd has lots of examples of cool Sorcerer settings all over the internet. A guy known as Old Scratch has a ton of them over at RPG.net. You can find some I've come up with <a href="http://playsorcerer.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">here.</a> ) <i>Schism</i> has a default for all this, so there's no need for you to do this. Everyone is, I assume, onboard.<br/><br/>Oh, and usually you play out the binding of the demons at this session as well.  This helps nail down a bit of the PC's personalities, relationship with demons and so on.<br/><br/><b>TWO</b><br/>The group gathers for a group character creation process. Everyone builds characters together, out loud, listening to each other, making suggestions. Everyone is working off the basic design elements the GM has brought to the table: The definition of Humanity, Demons; the brushstroke of setting details. Moreover, everyone is filling out the specific list from the character creation list: Kickers, Telltales, Prices and so on. Vital to this process is grid that's often found on the "back of the character sheet." I refer to it as the Character Grid. This is a list of people, places and things the Player considers so vital and/or interesting that they help define the character and the things the Player wants to see in one play or another.<br/><br/>I consider the Grid so important I redesigned the character sheet so that it's front and center on the sheet. This is the grid that Players add the NPCs, objects and places tied to the PCs Kicker, Price, Lore, and Cover. <br/><br/>There's a lot to say about all of this, but two quick notes here:.<br/><br/><b>a) The Players really should author their own Kickers</b>. This is the definitional quality of a Kicker in <i>Sorcerer</i>. If the Players don't author their own Kickers, you'll have something very much like a Sorcerer Kicker... but really, it won't be. There's a lot more to say about this as well, but the point right now is this: The purpose of Player authored Kickers is that you, as GM, have absolute confidence that the Players are invested in what the story is going to be about.<br/><br/>This procedure maneuvers around a common RPG fallacy: "If the PCs care about the story hook, then the Players will too." This isn't always true, and can lead to problems later on. By allowing the Players to say, "I want a story about <i>this</i>," the GM is assured that as long as he keeps addressing that Kicker in one way or another through play, the Player will be invested in the game.<br/><br/>This assumes that the Player authors a KIcker that really does intrigue him. (<i>Sorcerer</i> expects everyone is authoring things they actually are interested in throughout play.) A Kicker also is also explicitly open-ended -- it states a circumstance of crisis that demands a decision of some sort from the PC -- but says nothing about how the story will go or what will happen. Resolving a Kicker is what the fictional structure of <i>Sorcerer</i> is about, and this resolution is unknown <i>until it happens</i>. <br/><br/><b>b) The Character Grid is vital.</b> The brainstorming the Players do of NPCs, objects and locations is a gold mine of material for the GM. Just like Kickers, what the Players write down in the grid is stuff the Players are saying they want in the game. In one way or another, they are saying, "I care about <i>this</i>." Or, "I'm interested in <i>this</i>."<br/><br/><b>THREE</b><br/>The character creation session ends and the GM goes off for a week or so with all the material created during character creation and works up his game prep. A <i>Sorcerer</i> GM does not have plot, but he is responsible for creating backstory and situation that will be the springwell for where the story goes.  He <i>grows</i> the backstory and situation elements from the details on the PC character sheets (the Price, the Character Grid, and so on), as well as other NPC, objects and places he thinks are cool.<br/><br/>It is important to understand that while the Player has absolute control over his PC in terms of decisions or actions and choices, the GM is in utter control of anything else the Player creates. All those NPCs the Player created are now owned by the GM as much as if he had created them himself. <br/><br/>With this comes an incredible responsibility: the impulse of some GMs will be to screw the Players over with the NPCs or to damage the NPCs in some way to provoke a response from the Players. This is an incredibly complicated topic, but I'll only say here the impulse of the GM should be to <i>deepen</i> the relationship and complexities between the PC and the NPCs. This doesn't mean the NPCs shouldn't be used to complicate the PC's life or serve as Bangs -- they definitely should!  But in general, the GM should look to the Kickers and see how he can use the NPCs to keep the KIcker electric and engaging. In the Kicker you'll find the themes and questions the Player was interested in. Use the NPCs to keep those themes and questions alive.<br/><br/><b>FOUR</b><br/>Everyone gathers up for the first session of play. Play begins.<br/><br/>Start with the Kickers, or scenes leading up to the Kickers. The GM frames scenes, but the Player often say things like, "I want to go to my ex-wife's house," and the GM picks it up from there.<br/><br/><b>FIVE</b><br/>Play continues.<br/><br/>There is no party. The GM will cross cut across the Players. The cross cuts are anywhere from one minute to eight minutes. Often Players WILL be in the same scene. But it is up to the Players to do this with their PCs. They have no obligation to share 'narrative space' together.<br/><br/>In general, I liken the story structure to that of multi-character, long form shows like LOST, HEROES, THE WIRE, THE SHIELD, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and so on. We cross-cut scenes between characters, catching them in quiet or dramatic moments, sometimes together, sometimes not, but always revolving around the core concerns of the show. The core concerns of a Sorcerer game are Humanity, the Demons, and the setting and situation details the GM has prepped.<br/><br/>I understand you don't believe this will work. It does. It just does.<br/><br/>Five things here: <br/><br/><b>a) Even if there's a "party," only one person can speak at any time anyhow</b>. The notion that having a party makes sure everyone is involved is kind of a babmboozle. I've thought about this a lot, though and I've realized that for some folks the issue isn't involvement, but the act of imagination. If My Guy isn't "in the scene" I have nothing to imagine for those moments of play. I accept this. And I can only say <i>Sorcerer</i> isn't designed to keep the players immerse moment to moment. (I also do not believe anyone is immersed moment-to-moment. But that's a whole level of crazy discussion I will never engage with any deeper. I'm stopping there.)<br/><br/><b>b) The Players simply care what the other Players are doing.</b> It has been my experience that because no one at the table knows where the story is going, and because the game is about very human choices, and everyone is riffing off shared, creative design elements (Humanity, the definition of Kickers, as well as shared details created during character creation) Players tend to be <i>very</i> interested what the other Players are doing with their PCs. "I'm doing this with my guy in terms of Humanity. What they they doing with their guy's Humanity?" is the best way to put it. In other words, it's not about the "plot" but about the human decisions the characters make. (The plot is created in the wake of these decisions.)<br/><br/><b>c) The Players are paying attention to each other's scenes because they want to know what is going on</b>. The GM will have created lots of situation and backstory. NPCs will be in motion. The agendas of the NPCs will provide mystery, which, I have found, will make the Players curious about how backstory and situation elements are connected. "If his demon is saying that NPC sorcerer is really powerful, then maybe my guy ought to go talk to him," a Player might think.<br/><br/><b>d) The Players often need a break.</b> <i>Sorcerer</i> can be a fast and intense game. Moreover, the Players are often confronted with extreme, human decisions ("Should I lie to my wife to prevent her from worrying?"; "Is my child worth killing another man?"; "Is it really worth risking a bit of my soul to get this deal?" and so on) that often leave them uncertain as to how to have their characters act in the moment. I often cut away from the Players to another Player when I see them confused or uncertain, or just ask, "Do you need a moment?" If they say yes, I jump to another plot line that is all part of the same story -- that is, another PC.<br/><br/><b>e) The Players tend to push their PCs together.</b> I think we've all observed that when something interesting starts  happening for one Player's PC, the other Players start saying things like, "I'm there" -- or words to that effect. Which is only to say that Players tend to bring their characters together on their own. This is not a goal, or something the GM should push for, nor is it the optimum state. Whether or not the PCs are hanging out in the same scene is up to the Players. But I've observed that the further the sessions go, the more the PCs start hanging out together because the Players (and the GM) are clearer about where the "action" is and want to be there as much as possible.<br/><br/><b>SIX</b><br/>Play continues over several sessions. The GM tosses out a Bang or two per session, the Players respond. Their response creates more complications or conflicts and play continues some more.<br/><br/>Eventually the GM is left with a brain that is exhausted. Playing on the fly like this is exhilarating and hard. At some point he'll need to retreat and let his brain process everything that happened. He'll need to consider a few more possible Bangs he might deliver the next session. He isn't "making everything up." The Kickers, the Character Sheets, the background and situation prep are all concrete things right in front of him that he's riffing on. But as the Players make new decisions for their PCs, new details are added. How to reincorporate what's been added to what's already there often requires some downtime.<br/><br/>My <i>Sorcerer</i> sessions are usually no longer than three hours in length. I've discovered that pushing pat the point when really it would be comfortable to stop is usually a bad idea. Things get forced. Decisions and creative choices get weak.<br/><br/>Sorcerer games usually last six to twelve session. It usually takes the first two or three session for everyone to find their bearings. The PCs are figuring out more details about their characters, choosing what intrigues them most about what's going on. Remember, the GM doesn't know which NPCs the Players will find most compelling as play continues.  The "Big Villain" might be some guy the GM thought was a two-bit player. The PCs might all end up facing off in a Mexican stand-off, or they might all join up in the end. There's no way to tell. And it takes a few sessions of intense play and downtime to sort out what paths will be walked.<br/><br/><br/>I understand you have ambitions to hand out pre-generated characters, play nine hours in one night, and so on. And it might work great! But in my experience you are running up against several proven methods of setting up and playing Sorcerer that are going to result in a less than optimal experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261793/#Comment_261793" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T09:31:53+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  9:31AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nocker</cite>No party... at all ???</blockquote>\nNot no party at all but being fine with the players starting in different places and weaving in to one another's paths if that is how it should shake out.

[edit: The difficulty was in <i>statting up</i> the Demons, just in case that wasn't clear.]<br/><br/>The game wasn't too bad: I'd say it was a success. That said, it certainly didn't live up to the potential of Sorcerer play, in that it was kind of senseless mishmash of sorcery and action rather than any kind of thematic exploration of humanity. It was still a good time, though, and with double the time frame and fewer players, I think things would go much better.<br/><br/>I've got a question for you Sorcerer-knowledgeables:<br/><br/>In terms of helping a "one shot" of Sorcerer go down, might it be possible for the GM to frontload things a little more than in the "default" mode of Sorcerer? I'm thinking of the GM introducing a setting and mood, as usual, in broad terms, and then outlining an existing situation or relationship map. Something like, "the prison of blah blah is in the town of X, and recently, the inmates broke out, and are now hiding in the town. The chief of the prison is undergoing heavy scrutiny, because of his affair with the Mayor of the town, who is now pregnant. A street gang known as "the Voodoo Strikers" is causing some trouble in town: most believe they were responsible for two recent ritualistic murders."<br/><br/>Then the GM asks for each player to create a character that's tied into one of these elements. One might choose to play the Mayor, say. Another might say, "my character is a private detective investigating the gang, who has just realized her son is a member."<br/><br/>For help with Kickers, players could choose from a short list of leading questions, things like: "One of the escaped prisoners is someone you care deeply about. Who are they and why are they so important to you?"<br/><br/>That would allow the GM to prepare a little before play (although much of that prep is bound to get turned inside out by the players' characters and Kickers), and the "leading questions" could help players author Kickers instead of facing a total blank.<br/><br/>I don't have enough experience with Sorcerer to say whether this sort of procedure is a good fit for the game, although I've used it with some success with a variety of systems. I'd love to hear from the Sorcerer veterans on this one--maybe this kind of approach could be a workable "middle ground" for a one-shot Sorcerer game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262531/#Comment_262531" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T11:31:59+00:00" title="March 17, 2010 11:31AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>Both Christopher Kubasik and I have done exactly what you describe.

I did it with a plague infecting decadent nobles in a gothic city as well as just starting with a grabby NPC called The Spider Queen.<br/><br/>It still takes at least an hour to create characters.  And if any one person is struggling with the core concept of the game it can take even longer.  It's very telling how creatively demanding Sorcerer can be when even character creation proves to be tough for some people.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262585/#Comment_262585" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T15:22:39+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  3:22PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>I've run In Utero at a convention once, and it worked very well.
