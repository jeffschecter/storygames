That helps immensely.<br/><br/>So on your first turn, no blanks came up out of six rolls? Tough luck on the first experience with the game. Was Alette frustrated by that?<br/><br/>I am very curious to see more about the game Jane mentioned. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nanenj" title="nanenj"><img alt="nanenj" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nanenj">nanenj</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224919/#Comment_224919" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T12:58:03+00:00" title="August 16, 2009 12:58PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm hoping we get to play it again, I'm a sucker for the simpler games and it was entertaining enough despite some grammatical niggles.  One player's numerically dyslexic and another from Norway.  But, I quickly whipped up an IRC bot to count the rolls more quickly and have been adding a little bit onto it just in case we do play again so tracking the rolls, free words, and coins are easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rolling nothing was a bit discouraging cause it happened -first- turn, but, you really get 3 'turns' a round in most cases anyways due to the 'next' player and 'previous' player.  It took us halfway through the game before I realised that I kinda read the rules for player to the left, and player to the right backwards.   Since we were on IRC. we have a vertical nickname list, and we used that for determining who was 'next' and 'previous' and thought +/- was logically backwards in that situation... but, came later to realise if you're playing in 'clockwise' order, that the 'next' player is indeed on your left.  So, despite that mishap (that didn't -really- matter since we were consistent the entire game... and I babble).  So... back on track.   The rolling nothing on a turn, isn't really that crippling due to the additional turns provided.  You're almost always gonna get 3 chances to contribute during a round.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game Jane mentioned is a children's party game, and is very much the same basic idea.  Each 'turn' a player rolls a normal six sided die.  That determines how many words they added to the sentence, then the next player, and next, all repeat this, working on one sentence.  When it gets back to the original player the sentence is finished.  The player after that then rolls and starts the next sentence.  Continues this way for a complete round, depending on the number of players.   A smaller group may do more rounds.   There's no buying free words or coin exchanging going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the fun game :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225067/#Comment_225067" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T09:16:50+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  9:16AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you post some tutorial on how to make that IRC bot somewhere?

Anyone with the programming know how to do so would likely be able to get it up on their own.  As is my code probably wouldn't be much use, but, if I can get it to a point where I really wouldn't have to offer too much tech support, I could probably post the script up someplace and let people do as they will with it.  Can possibly clean it up enough to let people drop by on IRC and take a look if there's any interest in that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot really sure on how long it took, my best guess is about an hour, and that was with interruptions and such from real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo name, I'll have to bug Jane about that later and see if we can figure it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225312/#Comment_225312" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T03:34:02+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  3:34AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks!
