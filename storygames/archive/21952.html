                    Two big, vague words.  <br/>Maybe more vague than story and game?<br/>What is certain?  <br/>Will my death not be fit for dramatic fictionalizing because of it's certainty?  <br/>Does one have any relation to another?  <br/>Aren't most things in life uncertain?  I mean, isn't this just a necessary component for life?<br/>Aren't most things, made by people, an attempt at certainty?<br/><br/>I don't wanna fall asleep on some random bed at night, I wanna fall asleep on my bed.  But if that bed, that I expect to be there, is no longer there, then it's dramatic.  It's dramatic because of my expectations. The drama's not coming from the mystery.  Maybe I give two shits about this lack of a bed?  It's because I cared about the old bed, cared enough for protagonist(me!) to leave my once comfortable apartment.  <br/><br/>My dependence on this bed was a lie.  Why?   Maybe this new bed-less existence, is on the surface, better than my old bed-having one?  Maybe I've tricked myself into thinking everything's fine just as long as I have a bed.   <br/><br/>Games are quite capable of uncertainty, but for synchronicity, and the oftentimes karmic justice of story, they often fall flat.  <br/><br/>A mystery is only as good as the feeling had before it disappeared.   Even a story with a windfall, is about something missing.                  </div>

                            Uncertainty is not so complicated. Drama, it has to be defined because it could mean Greek drama, Theater from the XIXth century, Important action in a fiction, Tense relationships.<br/>In RPG, I use Drama with the last two definitions : the action (opposing it to the Theme) or conflict between (player) characters.                        </div>

                            Ooh. I just started a thread on this before seeing yours. Shall we combine them or let them run in parallel?                        </div>
