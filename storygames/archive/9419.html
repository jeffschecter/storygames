Due to wor, kids, and other commitments, they find it difficult to have a regular campaign. Therefore, they have asked if any GMs would like to run one-shot games for them occasionally on Saturday nights.<br/><br/>I am down for this kind of gig; they're great people, they cook for their GMs, and it'd be nice to see them gaming more often. And one-shot games are a lot easier to prepare, so no drama there. The main challenge I have is the Saturday thing. I usually spend weekends with my girlfriend, as she lives across town so doing things with her during the week is tricky. My girlfriend is not a roleplayer (she'll play a few boardgams, but isn't interested in RPGs). Most of my own gaming is done on Monday or Tuesday nights so that I'm not spending time on an activity that excludes her during the times we like to spend together. Fortunately, K does very much like the people in this kid-and-responsibility-laden RPG group; she loves going there for dinner and boardgame/Singstar/Wii nights.<br/><br/>So!<br/><br/>I'm looking for ideas about ancillary activities that coule be organised to run at the same time as a one-shot RPG. Space is not an issue (the family that hosts these game nights live in an entertainer's delight), so we could conceivably all have dinner together, and then split into one group for the RPG and a second group for another fun past-time. Has anybody got any stories about a similar arrangement?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208901/#Comment_208901" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-24T16:54:05+00:00" title="May 24, 2009  4:54PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Board games, card games, movies, television, badminton, croquet, scrapbooking, dildo polishing, dog running...<br/><br/>The question is are there going to be other people there who aren't going to play? a few peopledoing something else is good.

I always marvel when I hear "So and so doesn't like RPGs" or "isn't interested." "Is too shy" makes sense (sort of), but a lack of interest in a pastime with scores of play modes and genres, provided by hundreds of games... I just marvel.<br/><br/>Also, might'n she and the other disinterested make their own arrangements for what they will do during such a meet-up? Suggestions are fine, sure; but there's an infinity of them--origami, macrame, Lego Mindstrom bot construction, haiku riddle writing, political phone canvassing... I mean, seriously? Maybe they'd just as soon go out clubbing and come pick you up at midnight (or whatever)?<br/><br/>I'd go for finding a game she'd enjoy, so as to actually spend that play time together, not in separate rooms (or buildings).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209676/#Comment_209676" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-30T11:35:40+00:00" title="May 30, 2009 11:35AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Also, might'n she and the other disinterested make their own arrangements for what they will do during such a meet-up?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This really seems to be the most sensible approach to me.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
