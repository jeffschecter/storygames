The Walking Eye's AP was excellent because that's what they do and as they play they try explain along with the game. It's a fun introductory campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.thewalkingeye.com/?p=1027<br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast JankCast's AP is more indepth and heavily story-driven with one or two sessions where they have a spectator so they actually talk about the rules more during those. <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://jankcast.com/archives/category/podcasts/actualplay<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth are great to listen to and very fun. Do yourself a favour and play this game, it's the greatest RPG I've ever played and it just keeps getting better! Of the nine players i've introduced it to they are all in love with it now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
