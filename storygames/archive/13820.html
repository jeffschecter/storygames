Some of them get pretty fiesty.<br/><br/>I'd like to re-examine the concept in the thread title. The terms here of Technique and Mechanics are stolen from TomasHVM's thread a while back, which frankly I've lost track of. Here's my take anyway.<br/><br/>Techniques are the things we do that actually makes play function. If we're playing old D&amp;D, one technique is that players of characters play adventurer types and engage with the GM's adventure/dungeon locale, making up character justification as necessary, simply so the game can proceed to the core activity.<br/><br/>Mechanics are the game-like stuff. They cover, especially in older styles, things like the interaction of character abilities with the environment.<br/><br/>Now, notably to me, early RPGs are a little scanty on the technique parts, and pretty heavy on the mechanics parts. Despite that, mechanics may not be all that important. <br/><br/>My feeling is that the mechanics parts of early games were mostly a record of the GM's personal calls that then formed a tool-kit, with maybe some expansions on the stuff to justify having someone pay actual money for it.<br/><br/>That last bit, I think, has fallen a bit into dis-favor, if it was ever really in favor. Certainly the discussions of Rule Zero seem to center around a general dislike of mechanics as tools, but not actually rules.<br/><br/>What I'd like to discuss is the possibility that there's a gem of approach buried in that mentality that's been overlooked by fans of more SG style games, and how that stuff can be made good.<br/><br/>At minimum, I'd like to discuss how Techniques ( under this formulation) can be put front and center in presentations, while still having tools available and important, but understood for what they're meant to be, and how they're put into serice in play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312908/#Comment_312908" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T12:21:32+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 12:21PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This makes sense to me. It's much more productive to look at something like "Old-School" D&amp;D as a set of (unwritten) Techniques, of which the Written Rules (mechanics) are just examples--specific notes about Saving Throws, etc, are basically notes on the way a DM applies principles and techniques to play. Looking at the actual mechanics of a game that's so heavy on GM judgement calls and "rulings" is very likely to miss the point.<br/><br/>I'd prefer to look at something like old-school D&amp;D as a set of something like Apocalypse World's Agenda, Principles, and Moves, with the written mechanics as just examples of implementation ("In our game, the GM ruled that an arrow broke when being pulled out of an enemy's corpse on a roll of 1-2 on a d6, to make our lives interesting"). This tells you more about the game, how it's played, and what makes it fun than trying to analyze the design principles behind specific encumbrance rules or random tables.<br/><br/>"Modern" games (especially Apocalypse World, Dogs, and Solar System come to mind) tend to do this better and better, focusing on the Techniques of play with much more clarity than old game texts (which are often simple compendia of mathematical "rulings", like, "Ok, roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the door handle breaks").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312912/#Comment_312912" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T12:33:48+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 12:33PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Old school D&amp;D <a href="http://www.latorra.org/2010/09/28/the-principles-of-moldvay-dd/" rel="nofollow">actually maps to principles very well</a>, interestingly enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312918/#Comment_312918" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T12:50:17+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 12:50PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Techniques are the things we do that actually makes play function.

(I'm working from an old school D&amp;D set up here, not more indie split-GMing abilities/duties perspective).<br/><br/>Since D&amp;D is kinda lingua franca, here's a quick. off-the-cuff list of technique stuff that I could see being more important for a game than mechanical knowledge, with regards to character players:<br/>______________<br/><b>First Game</b><br/>If this is the first game you're playing ever, roll up your character randomly and ask advice from other players and the GM about the best kind of character to make with what you've rolled.<br/><br/>Once you've picked one, along with alignment and gear, pick a stereotype, in your own head, of that kind of character.<br/><br/>During the adventure, portray your character based on the stereotype of race/class and alignment you've picked. Do at least one thing in-character, that hits on each of those two points.<br/><br/>At least once in the adventure, portray your character by speaking in the first person for them. Do it in a way that indicates something about the character. feel free to use bad accents or weird speech patterns as appropriate.<br/><br/>At least once during the adenture, portray your character by speaking in the third person about them. describe their actions or appearance in a way for the other players to get a better idea about them (possibly in a way the character themself wouldn't want to let on.)<br/><br/>During play, create a reason why the character is going on the adventure, even if you're playing it as if they wouldn't want to for practical or personal reasons.<br/><br/>Make up one main physical trait that is obvious visuallly about your character that all the other characters would obviously notice.<br/><br/>All of the other character players will be doing the above things. Work with those cues and play your character into them.<br/><br/>While on an adventure, do something dangerous or foolhardy at least once.<br/><br/>Feel free to ask how something works in the game, in terms of what you need to roll and so on. Don't feel like you need to know the tools the DM is using right off.<br/><br/>Feel free to ask what the GM or other players what odds and likely outcomes of a proposed action are before you roll any dice. If you don't like the odds, try something to make them more in your favor. <br/><br/>If your character gets killed or otherwise taken out of play, roll up another one randomly. No mmatter what you roll, make the character different from the last one, but still start with a basic stereotype and one visual cue.<br/><br/><b>If you're playing more than one session with the same character:</b><br/>Think of one way you aren't like the original stereotype you chose<br/><br/>Think of a way that you're even more that stereotype than you showed in the first game<br/><br/>Make a point of portraying both of those during play<br/><br/>Make a point of again portraying the stereotypes you first chose, and speaking in character, trying something foolhardy, describing third person your actions, and portraying any quirks<br/><br/>At least once in your portrayal that session, make a reference back to something from a previous adventure session<br/><br/>Come up with one factoid about your character that hasn't been revealed before and make a point of revealing it. It should be something open-ended.<br/><br/><b>If you've been playing many sessions or will be:</b><br/><br/>The longer a character survives, the more they inherently become fleshed out and you get a better feel for them. Switch up the kinds of callbacks mentioned above.<br/><br/>After a couple of adventures, start suggesting things that could be adventure worthy and tied into your character or other people's characters, or that tie back into earlier adventures.<br/>_______<br/><br/>Anyway, that's the kind of thing I'm thinking of...a bunch of soft "techniques" that are really important, so important that they, in a sense, are the actual rules of play. All before much of any discussion of mechanics, which I'm suggesting dumping over in a "tool kit" section.<br/><br/>(This isn't entirely academic; I'm actually trying to figure out how to reduce this stuff down and put the techniques stuff front and center for a design, with this stuff geared towards character players. I'm shooting for a single side of one sheet, with setting and pregen character info and a bit of mechanics/tools on the other side)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312930/#Comment_312930" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T14:07:15+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  2:07PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2011 2:07PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I'm wondering: how well do RPG advice books (like Play Unsafe, or even the Idiot's Guide to D&amp;D or whatever that book was) cover techniques?  And are they effective at teaching them?<br/><br/>I know that, at least among my friends, we mostly learned from other people.  It was best if you played with someone who demonstrated good technique; second best was being told about good technique by other gamers and then experimenting with it in an actual game.  Is it possible for a game text to outperform those traditional methods of instruction, or is supplementing them the best we can hope for?  I mean, there's a significant industry devoted to producing books and videos on how to improve your golf swing, but it's still faster and more effective to have someone teach it to you on the driving range.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312931/#Comment_312931" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T14:13:13+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  2:13PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2011 2:14PM by komradebob.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, on a personal level Play Unsafe is probably the best example of showing off techniques I've yet encountered, but notably it isn't about any particular game.<br/><br/>I guess I'm trying to get how to Play Unsafe-ize other games here, especially my own designs. <br/><br/>With that in mind though, it isn't <i>just</i> that I'm looking at.
