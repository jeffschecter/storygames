While there, I was asked a lot of questions by Finns, Swedes and many others who were intrigued but suspect of the Forgian emphasis on heavy mechanical structure in our game design.  The jeeps among them. But when I got a chance to play a jeep game, it was alien, yet strangely familiar. Like they had a lot of the same goals, but were doing things in the most different ways possible from forge--and its relations/diaspora--style of play.  Along with some dangerous agendas. <br/><br/>I thought it would be a nice gesture to continue the cultural exchange on a more public forum so we could continue learning from and about one another.  I've invited Tobias Wrigstad to come debate--or rather discuss, the jeep way, and give him an opportunity to ask any questions he might have about our strange and alien ways as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94885/#Comment_94885" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T18:06:57+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  6:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 6:09PM by Emily_Care.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first question for you, Tobias, is how did you get into Jeep form and role playing in general?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94893/#Comment_94893" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T18:38:01+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  6:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Wow. I didn't know we were going to get personal.</p>\n<p>As I remember it, I got in touch with role-playing in 1983, as I<br/>\nwas about to turn 7. Then I played because all the cool guys (who<br/>\nwere all older, incidentally) were doing it. It could have been<br/>\n1984, but I'm pretty sure it was in '83. We played the Swedish D&amp;D<br/>\nequivalent. BTW, 2007 marks my 10th year as a freeform-only<br/>\nscenario wright. I feel I should have developed much more than I<br/>\nhave. It is a bit shameful, actually.</p>\n<p>But never mind that, let's fast-forward a couple of years. In the<br/>\nearly or mid 90's, I was starting to be active in the Swedish con<br/>\nscene.</p>\n<p>Around this time, larping started to be popular in Sweden.<br/>\nLarping meant dressing up and simulating what happened when elves<br/>\nand orcs incidentally picked the same spot to celebrate summer<br/>\nsolstice or something like that. Most importantly, larping was<br/>\nagile -- everything was done without a character sheet or a GM.</p>\n<p>It was now that freeform started to get really hot and interesting<br/>\nat Swedish cons. People were also larping and wanted to keep that<br/>\nagility and also act out. People also started to come clean about<br/>\nnot really using the rules anyway, because they were to cumbersome<br/>\nor just messed up the story because a critical person would die<br/>\nfrom a crappy dice roll.</p>\n<p>I immediately took to freeform. It felt like the stuff I had been<br/>\nwanting to do -- create good drama -- and was frustrated by the<br/>\nlack of in the games we played at the time. I also liked to use<br/>\nthe entire body for acting, not just sitting around a table<br/>\ntalking. It made it easier to feel, and it was apparent to me that<br/>\nit was more powerful medium of expression than just the voice.</p>\n<p>Jeepform arrived on the scene around 2000. We didn't call it<br/>\nJeepform until much later. Jeepform is a silly name, but it is way<br/>\nless overloaded than freeform. And you can google it. Which is<br/>\ngreat. Anyway.</p>\n<p>Jeepform for me is a point of realisation. What I/we had wanted to<br/>\ndo with our freeform games. For me personally, the recognition of<br/>\nthe importance of the meta-play was a big thing. I had realised<br/>\npretty early on that I was interested in stories and people. I<br/>\noverdosed on fantasy as a kid, and wanted to avoid that, and also<br/>\ndeal more with everyday drama than epic drama. But I was also<br/>\ninterested in form (= techniques for playing, "heavy mechanical<br/>\nstructure", etc.).  And to me, as I have written <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4211&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">elsewhere on Story Games</a><br/>\nrecently, freeform has been about creating the best possible form<br/>\nfor the story you want to play.</p>\n<p>I feel that freeform in Sweden stopped experimenting early on, and<br/>\nJeepform almost requires experimenting and moving on by<br/>\ndefinition. At least if you want to tell different stories with<br/>\ndifferent messages or premises. I want to develop form to fit<br/>\nstory. Thus, I'm a Jeep.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94911/#Comment_94911" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T19:36:15+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  7:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry about that.

Let's stick with the former for now.</p>\n<p>We wanted a term that was more narrow (and thus more useful) than<br/>\nfreeform to be able to say "this is (not) jeep form" about stuff.<br/>\nOut of politeness, we didn't want to hijack an existing term. I<br/>\nstill think this was a wise choice.</p>\n<p>So let me explain what I mean by freeform by triangulation.</p>\n<p>Historically, I think that in freeform, the story (or the message<br/>\nor the premise) is the arbiter. In table-top (and forgean games?),<br/>\nthe arbiter is a (general) set of rules. In larp, mostly for<br/>\nlogistical reasons, the story cannot be arbiter as everyone is the<br/>\nmain character of his/her own story-arc, and any over-arching<br/>\nstory is subordinate and incidental.</p>\n<p>For me, freeform has been about finding the best possible form for<br/>\nthe telling of the story at hand, which means that form is "free"<br/>\n-- it changes from scenario to scenario. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4211&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Elsewhere on Story<br/>\nGames</a><br/>\nI wrote "[The free in freeform does not mean] free as in free of<br/>\nthe shackles of simulation games (like D&amp;D) [but] free as in Indie<br/>\nor free as in do what's best for you."</p>\n<p>Most freeform scenarios that I see today don't tailor form to<br/>\nstory. Freeform effectively isn't free anymore, but fixed. There<br/>\nis a silent agreement on what it is (or the different forms a<br/>\nfreeform game should have) and people stick to it. I'm sure this<br/>\nis a Scandinavian thing more than a global thing.</p>\n<p>In a sense, jeepform is freeform that refuses to become fixed in<br/>\nthis sense. It doesn't have to be more complicated than that,<br/>\nactually. Whenever you want to play, you start with a blank sheet<br/>\nof paper (rather than with the silent agreement of what freeform<br/>\nis) and then you only bring on-board form/techniques that fits<br/>\nthat game. This is why we keep repeating stuff like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Character ownership is optional</li>\n<li>Role monogamy is optional</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because we have to bring everything in by conscious choice. Not by<br/>\ndefault or old habit or because we're safe with those techniques<br/>\nor because we think the players like it.</p>\n<p>IMHO, tailoring form to story often requires experimentation. If<br/>\nmy next game is going to be nothing like my last, then I probably<br/>\nwill make use of completely different techniques to make it<br/>\nhappen. And since we haven't all been doing this forever, those<br/>\ntechniques may well have to be invented. Or at least modified.</p>\n<p>So what do I mean by techniques? I mean pretty much anything. It<br/>\ncan be <em>"a character must always interpret things in the worst<br/>\npossible way for herself"</em> or <em>"people bid on GM power for<br/>\nindividual scenes using system X"</em> or <em>"no physical interaction"</em>.<br/>\nThe key is understanding why and what you'd get out of it. The<br/>\nfirst "rule" could be used in a game about distrust and loyalty,<br/>\nthe second could be used simply to distribute GM power in order to<br/>\nmake the game richer (more influences from different persons) and<br/>\nthe third can be useful in a game about isolation. You are likely<br/>\nto end up using several such rules to get to your point.</p>\n<p>For me, Jeepform also stresses a few other things like <em>"no heroes<br/>\nand villains"</em>, <em>"play subtle"</em> and <em>"always have a premise or<br/>\nsubject"</em>, things which are controversial for some. To me, the<br/>\nquest is as dead as the party. Last, a big thing for me, is the<br/>\nrecognition of the meta-play as being equally important as what<br/>\nhappens in the shared fantasy.</p>\n<p>If you go to <a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/" rel="nofollow">http://jeepen.org/dict/</a>, which is where we try to<br/>\ndescribe what it is we do, there is a list of "truths", which we<br/>\nbelieve are mostly true for all role-playing. Just below this<br/>\nlist, there is a list called "The Jeepform Piece of the Cake",<br/>\nwhich is an attempt at capturing some core values of jeepform.<br/>\nSince I know how hard it can be to click a link, I'm repeating it<br/>\nhere:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How you tell the story is as important as the story itself.</li>\n<li>Form should be tailored to the telling of the story at hand.</li>\n<li>Form should support good flow with few interruptions.</li>\n<li>Rules for deciding outcomes of actions, etc. are allowed only in<br/>\ncorrespondence with item no. 3, but should generally not be<br/>\nneeded.</li>\n<li>Focus is on the story, which takes precedence over both total<br/>\nimmersion and play-for-show.</li>\n<li>Transparency is important to facilitate collaborative play<br/>\n-- there should basically not be any secrets. For this<br/>\nreason, and others, split party is banned.</li>\n<li>The meta play is as important to the game as the actual play [=shared fantasy].</li>\n<li>Meta discussions and meta information are banned to the largest<br/>\npossible extent unless they are a deliberate part of the meta<br/>\nplay to affect the actual play.</li>\n<li>The existence of characters is almost mandatory; characters<br/>\nand story should be made to support each other.</li>\n<li>Character ownership is optional; a character can be played by<br/>\nmore than one player.</li>\n<li>Role monogamy is optional; a player can have more than one<br/>\ncharacter.</li>\n<li>The inner thoughts and feelings of the characters should<br/>\npreferably be expressed in the play using appropriate<br/>\ntechniques.</li>\n<li>More than one game master is generally a good idea, especially<br/>\nin the presence of complex form. Game masters should preferably<br/>\nnot be players also.</li>\n<li>A high degree of player freedom is desirable.</li>\n<li>Actual props and well-prepped gaming locations are generally bad<br/>\nthings as they become obstacles to the immersion (what am I allowed<br/>\nto do with this prop?) and constrain the game to move outside of<br/>\nthe prepped location (which is sometimes desirable).</li>\n<li>That a game is not a rail-road is not an excuse for a lousy<br/>\nstory.</li>\n<li>The most important aspect of a story is how it affects the characters <br/>\nin it, not whether the characters manage to save the world in the end.</li>\n<li>Everyday drama is more interesting than epic drama.</li>\n<li>There are very few situations where the Game master should be <br/>\nplaying the extras. Extras are good. <em>Non-player</em> characters <br/>\nare not.</li>\n<li>"Breaking" any of the "rules" above is only allowed in order to<br/>\nmake a point.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want me to expand on any of these points, I'd be happy<br/>\nto. But I feel this post is becoming too long already, so I wont<br/>\ndo it unless asked.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure I've ever said jeepform is supposed to be "cutting<br/>\nedge". What I do like about it is really the emphasis on pushing<br/>\nform and form development and that form considers meta-play and<br/>\nshared fantasy equally. A rule that says "you cannot ever comfort<br/>\nanother character" is naturally targeting the player and her<br/>\nnatural urge to comfort someone, not the characters.</p>\n<p>Maybe this all means that jeepform games are more likely to be<br/>\ncutting edge than other games. I dunno.</p>\n<p>There is one more point I'd like to make, which is the first item<br/>\nof the "truths" list mentioned above:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Restrictions foster creativity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was surprised to find that people view this as un-freeform. To<br/>\nme, this is the most obvious truth. And finding a balance where<br/>\nyou have the right restrictions to keep the game focused on the<br/>\npremise but free enough to still be interesting is a key problem<br/>\nin game design.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94947/#Comment_94947" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T23:42:08+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 11:42PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>One more thing. I've been surprised to see jeepform labelled as<br/>\nlarp. It is labelled thus because we generally stand up and act<br/>\neverything out. To me, jeepform has always been more table-top<br/>\nthan larp, but perhaps I'm wrong.</p>\n<p>In any case, we don't wear costumes and we don't use prepped<br/>\nlocations. What we do do, is move about, and map the world in the<br/>\nshared fantasy onto the physical gaming location. Because then it<br/>\nbecomes obvious that I'm stepping out of the car, or exiting the<br/>\ncave, or is trying to open the door, without me ever having to<br/>\nbreak character and say it. More stuff can go on in parallel<br/>\nwithout the need for out-of-character communication. This is a<br/>\ngood thing. This is part of what is meant by <em>form should support<br/>\ngood flow with few interruptions</em>. Breaking away from the<br/>\nrole-playing to resolve a challenge event using dice is almost<br/>\nalways a bad thing IMHO, because it directs your attention to the<br/>\nwrong things.

I always hated this,<br/>\nboth as a GM or a player. It happened a lot in the bad old days.<br/>\nI'm a big fan of not all characters being on screen at every point<br/>\nin time, but characters and players are two different things.</br></p>\n<p>I want all the players to be in the same room always (unless there<br/>\nis a really good point to it, like to create real distrust among<br/>\nthe players). IMHO, freeform role-playing always benefits from all<br/>\nparticipants, players and GM alike, agreeing on what the game is<br/>\nabout and (to some extent) where it is going. If people are forced<br/>\nto leave the room, that wont happen.</p>\n<p>Transparency in our terminology means no secrets. If I know your<br/>\ncharacter is the traitor, then I can help you get into situations<br/>\nwhere that can create good drama. There may still be secrets for<br/>\nthe characters, but not for the players. And people <em>do</em> know how<br/>\nto separate what they know and what their characters know.</p>\n<p>So, yes. It is an issue of physical space -- a logistical<br/>\nissue. This is why I prefer freeform to larping. In larp you<br/>\n"cannot" time-travel over here because someone might burst in and<br/>\nnot have a clue on what is happening, etc. Plus when a lot of cool<br/>\nthings happen all over, the over-arching story is lost.</p>\n<p>I hope I managed to answer you question. If not, fire again.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95056/#Comment_95056" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T09:33:22+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  9:33AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You did, thanks.

If so, what's wrong with the latter?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Meta play and meta discussion are two different things. Meta play<br/>\nis whatever goes on between the players in the room. If I'm<br/>\nkissing you (remember, we act things out) in a game where my<br/>\ngirlfriend is also playing, then stuff happens in the room that is<br/>\ndefinitely not part of the shared fantasy, but is still important<br/>\nand can be leveraged on in the game.</p>\n<p>Meta information or meta discussion is really whatever information<br/>\nthat needs be disseminated outside of the characters. Like "is the<br/>\ndoor locked?", or "I position myself so that I can see through the<br/>\nwindow", etc. I think that sucks because it can almost always be<br/>\nsolved by role-playing, like the player trying to open the door or<br/>\npositioning herself somewhere while muttering "I wonder if I can<br/>\nsee through the window from over here". Cheezy examples, perhaps,<br/>\nbut illustrative.</p>\n<p>I think every break from character should be motivated. In some<br/>\ngames, the meta discussion is an integral part of the game, and<br/>\nshould be there. Like in Doubt, the preplanning and between-scenes<br/>\ndiscussion is equally important as the actual role-playing,<br/>\nbecause the <em>players</em> are talking about relationsships, prejudice,<br/>\netc. Which is a goal of the game. Which is what is meant by the<br/>\nlatter part of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a> and all of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a>.</p>\n<p>For me "What does the room look like?" and "You enter into a blah<br/>\nblah..." is unnecessary. In the relatively few cases where this<br/>\ninformation is needed, the GM can always give it through voice<br/>\novers that could be e.g., in the mind of a character, and that<br/>\ndon't interrupt the play. The GM is broadcasting stuff and you can<br/>\ntune in if you like, or not. We're getting into another<br/>\ndiscussion, so I'll stop it here.</p>\n<p>Basically, if the information you want to disseminate does not<br/>\nsupport the premise (e.g., it just facilitates play like my<br/>\nexamples above), it can be solved without talking outside or<br/>\nbreaking character.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95109/#Comment_95109" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T10:34:57+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 10:34AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 10:35AM by Emily_Care.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Tobias</cite>Historically, I think that in freeform, the story (or the message or the premise) is the arbiter.

Something I'm picking up on, from the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4211" rel="nofollow">conversation about freeform</a> the other day here is the lack of reward cycles, which are absolutely key in story/forge games.  So what takes the place in freeform games? It sounds like simple loyalty to the story, or development of character, or advancement of theme.  [Edited to add:] Which must be what you mean when you say "the story controls..."<br/><br/>So, let's talk about some of the deeper, darker bits of jeep.

Something I'm picking up on, from the conversation<br>\n  about freeform the other day here is the lack of reward cycles,<br>\n  which are absolutely key in story/forge games. So what takes the<br>\n  place in freeform games? It sounds like simple loyalty to the<br>\n  story, or development of character, or advancement of theme.</br></br></br></br></p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I'm not a theorist, but here goes:</p>\n<p>The reward in a freeform game, as I see it, is peer recognition.<br/>\nYou add stuff to the story and the other players take that in and<br/>\nappreciate it. When you do something cool in the game, you feel it<br/>\nin the room. That's the short-term reward. Plus the cool scenes<br/>\nwhen they happen. Doing something cool could be taking the story<br/>\nsomeplace unexpected, or making a great character interpretation,<br/>\nor having great timing, or ... You get the picture.</p>\n<p>The long-term reward is creating the best possible story or<br/>\nwhatever the game is about. If it is about contemplating<br/>\nrelationships etc. (more about that below) then doing that and<br/>\ncoming out on the other side as a person with new perspectives or<br/>\nexperiences, or just having gone through a personal catharsis is<br/>\nthe long-term reward.</p>\n<p>Development of character could be there too, but story is still<br/>\nking, or the intended personal/group experiences.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>So, let's talk about some of the deeper, darker bits of<br/>\n  jeep. You've mentioned several times how meta-information should<br/>\n  not be set aside, but can be seen as some of the (most<br/>\n  important?) material of the game. Could you talk about playing<br/>\n  close to home? How do you deal with things when it cuts too<br/>\n  close to the bone and goes awry? And then there are the ethical<br/>\n  issues it raises.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Yes!</p>\n<p>(I'll return to meta-information tomorrow or later depending on<br/>\nhow well I sleep. I didn't find a good way to integrate it in this<br/>\npost.)</p>\n<p>Playing close to home is about using stuff from real life and<br/>\nplaying about things that are real and that you can relate<br/>\nto. Doubt, which I have mentioned already, is a game about when<br/>\nyou should break up or fight to save a relationship, about<br/>\ntemptation and about what counts as infidelity. In Doubt, players<br/>\nare encouraged to play close to home. They have minimal<br/>\ncharacters, and the game is quite hetero-normative and<br/>\nstereotypical. Thus, there is ample opportunity for the players to<br/>\nuse stuff from their real lives -- old relationships and old<br/>\nboyfriends/girlfriends. They have a chance to use them here as<br/>\ninspiration, or to say stuff to them that they didn't get to<br/>\noriginally, or realise why stuff happened the way it happened, or<br/>\ntry alternative routes. Finally, I get to tell you the story about<br/>\nmy cheating on my girl friend in my early twenties, but in this<br/>\nanonymous setting, where you don't know what's real and what<br/>\nisn't.</p>\n<p>I also get to look into the eyes of my (real-life) girl friend<br/>\n(who is also playing) and hold a monologue about how a marriage<br/>\nproposal is an evil ultimatum and how marriage is a futile attempt<br/>\nat ownership of another person. It does not matter what I believe<br/>\nor not in these matters. It is thought-provoking, developing and<br/>\ninteresting. In a sense it can also be a game of "I dare you"<br/>\nbetween you and yourself.</p>\n<p>Basically, playing close to home is about consciously using or<br/>\nseeking emotions that are rooted in you, that you can really<br/>\nrelate to or that you have perhaps not processed fully<br/>\nyet. Depending on who you are, it can be threading dangerous<br/>\nground, or not. For some it is just a cool thrill, for others, it<br/>\ncan be very challenging or even life-altering. There is really no<br/>\nway to tell, and it will vary with the electricity of each<br/>\nevening.</p>\n<p>So, how to deal with things when they explode? I don't know. My<br/>\nadvice and general strategy for this is to just be a human being.<br/>\nEveryone knows it is a game, and all players know we are taking it<br/>\nas close to home as we want. Generally, things don't explode,<br/>\nbecause it is very hard to tell what is close to home or not,<br/>\nunless you know each other very well. And if you do, then your<br/>\nfriends are there if you would burst. Which is great.</p>\n<p>I've had players break and not being able to continue playing. Or<br/>\nplayers bursting into tears seemingly for no reason. I have never<br/>\nhad a player regretting that he or she was in the game from the<br/>\nstart (with exceptions that don't belong in this discussion).<br/>\nGenerally, when players break, it is due to some problem that the<br/>\nhe or she had that was just brought to the surface by the<br/>\ngame. And then you're probably in a good crowd to be comforted.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you'll feel that you're going too deep for some people,<br/>\nand then you can just pull out.</p>\n<p>Granted, I've done stupid things in role-playing games that I<br/>\nregret, but that's part of the deal. If we want interesting games,<br/>\nthen that comes with the territory. I was talking to a person<br/>\ntoday about running a game with him and he immediately asked "What<br/>\nis your hidden agenda?" That was fun. (I'm definitely not like<br/>\nthat always, but in this case, he correctly had a feeling I wanted<br/>\nto use the game to work on something in his life. In the end, he<br/>\ndidn't want to play, which is sad but OK. Just talking about some<br/>\nthings in the game was too close to home, and I ended up sending<br/>\nhim monologue texts from the game that quite well fitted his<br/>\ncurrent situation. He thought that was scary.)</p>\n<p>So, what's the ethics of this you ask. This is murky waters for<br/>\nsure. But I think that as long as you are not evil, not abusing<br/>\nyour powers or have a too shaky hidden agenda, almost everything<br/>\nis playable. Me and another guy did a game in 1996 where four of<br/>\nthe players are turned against the fifth. All the other players<br/>\nwould leave the room to plot just to create a "bad feeling about<br/>\nthis" in the fifth player. That was criticised back then because<br/>\npeople expected role-playing to be about people collaborating, not<br/>\nback-stabbing each other. Basically. Today, I don't think people<br/>\nwould think this was weird.</p>\n<p>Whenever I go all-in, I commit to picking up the pieces if<br/>\nnecessary. That's not so great, but it is the best I can do. And<br/>\nit seems to suffice.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95376/#Comment_95376" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T06:59:51+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  6:59AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lukzu</cite>Tobias,<br/>Your 20 points are the most interesting thing I've read about roleplaying as a form and art in at least a year.

Quite the opposite, really.  <br/><br/>Incidentally, I have managed to extract a promise from Tobias to actually <i>write</i> a Forge style game with me, in return for a similar deal I made with him and Thorbiorn Fritzon to write a jeep form game together, which will be a joy. So, there is no way Tobias can escape playing some of our games. Writing one would be impossible otherwise.  <br/><br/>I'm tabulating a mental list, Tobias, of games to play with you at GenCon and Dreamation. So far <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24759.0" rel="nofollow">Adventures in the Land of 1000 Kings</a> and <a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/games.html" rel="nofollow">Primetime Adventures</a> are on it.  <br/><br/>I just came up with this interesting <a href="http://jeepen.olle.ter.dk/wiki/doku.php?id=theory:comparing_free_form_with_larp_and_table-top_role_play" rel="nofollow">comparison</a> of larp, freeform and tabletop. It makes the similarities between table top and jeep much more plain. It might be useful for us to hear more descriptions of jeep games in action, to give the discussion of techniques some more context.  What is your idea of the perfectly played jeep scenario? (Do you use that word?) What makes a session successful or not? Is there this distinction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95721/#Comment_95721" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T19:07:53+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  7:07PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p><strong>Per wrote</strong></p>\n<p>See, Luke, this is what I'm not getting: if I read the Jeep<br/>\n  statements and Tobias's answers here correctly, your games are<br/>\n  disqualified right away - they resolve conflicts with dice,<br/>\n  embrace meta discussions/info as a virtue of play etc. The jeepers<br/>\n  claim their goals can never be achieved that way*.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This discussion is a bit over my head, I think, as I'm not too<br/>\nfamiliar with the games Luke is talking about.

Claiming that something isn't role-play because<br/>\nthere is no GM is just stupid and (probably) based on old<br/>\npreconceptions.</p>\n<p>This reminds me of the following: Two years back, I spent 15<br/>\nminutes on a bus riding to a con with a guy I hadn't seen in 10<br/>\nyears. I said something about rules mostly fucking up the flow of<br/>\na game, and he said he'd much rather fight with dice rather than<br/>\narbitrarily deciding things. I said that that was a common<br/>\nmisunderstanding of freeform and besides, who includes fights in<br/>\nrole-playing games today anyway? Then he said <em>"If you take fighting out of role-playing, then it is not really role-playing anymore."</em></p>\n<p>OK, so saying that the story suffers with increased player<br/>\nautonomy is about preconceptions about what a story is.

By genre I mean "I'm a wizard! I'm a space marine!"</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This is a good point. I don't actually think that playing wizards<br/>\nor space marines needs to be an obstacle to any kind of heart-felt<br/>\nrole-playing, close to home included. Some times you can actually<br/>\nbe very surprised when "real stuff" enter into the fantasy-ish<br/>\nworld, since you might not have expected that. When you play<br/>\nkitchen sink realism, it is easy to "raise the shields"<br/>\n(subconsciously or not) in anticipation of incoming heaving<br/>\nstuff.</p>\n<p>For me, playing everyday life, or real-world like scenarios help<br/>\nme identify more. As I said, I overdosed on fantasy as a kid, and<br/>\nthe thought of wizards or vampires makes me a bit queasy. Unless<br/>\nyou've role-played way more than your recommended daily value, I<br/>\nwould think that most people find the arbitrary but sensible<br/>\ndefinition of the real world more easy to relate to than the Wild<br/>\nWest, Cyberpunk or Middle Earth. That's powerful to me, and<br/>\nsomething I want to use. There is less need for things like meta<br/>\ninformation and meta discussion if you don't have to explain what<br/>\na Kraken is, or whatever.</p>\n<p>But in terms of playing close to home, or playing heavy or<br/>\nheart-felt role-playing, I think that the most significant bit is<br/>\nyour players. And where you want to take it. If you want to play a<br/>\ngame about crime and punishment, playing both in the 1800s and<br/>\ntoday might actually be a good thing. Good sci-fi should deal with<br/>\nsubjects such as that. I could imagine that it is easier to laugh<br/>\nstuff away if you suddenly would observe the game from the outside<br/>\nand realise that the deeply troubled juvenile delinquent has green<br/>\nskin, though. But all this has more to do with the players and the<br/>\nfeeling in the room than the setting or anything.</p>\n<p>OTOH, I do think we should leave genre literature and go straight<br/>\nfor literature in role-playing. At least most of the time. Even<br/>\nthough I'm a sucker for slow crime novels with Swedish policemen.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95732/#Comment_95732" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T19:38:12+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  7:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2007 7:44PM by Tobias Wrigstad.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p><strong>komradebob wrote</strong></p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>To follow up on Jason's question, does keeping to more 'real<br/>\n  world" stuff help speed up entry into play?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I'm not entirely sure what you mean by entry into play.

(Do you<br/>\n  use that word?) What makes a session successful or not? Is there<br/>\n  this distinction?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Hm. I honestly don't know. Jeep games (or whatever they should be<br/>\ncalled) come in many different shapes and sizes, I would say. A perfectly played<br/>\nsession should have good flow, in that there are no/few<br/>\ninterruptions of relevant actual or meta play. It should be about<br/>\nsomething that is interesting, and that should have materialised<br/>\nduring the session -- we should have connected with that subject.<br/>\nI also think that there should be (strong) emotions in it at some<br/>\npoint at least. Emotions that you can feel and relate to.</p>\n<p>It is very hard to answer this question, I think. Some games are<br/>\nmeant to frustrate the players. Most are not. Some are pure<br/>\nentertainment value. Others are arty or pretentious. I don't think<br/>\nI can answer this question without being too general and thus not<br/>\nreally saying anything useful.</p>\n<p>We say "fun, not funny". That's how it should be. Sometimes<br/>\nplayers will say that it wasn't even funny, but rewarding or<br/>\nworthwile or something. (Emily, you might remember some comments<br/>\nlike that after playing Doubt in Helsinki.)</p>\n<p>There are definitely both successful and unsuccessful sessions.<br/>\nUnsuccessful ones are generally when the players (and/or GM) don't<br/>\nconnect with the material for some reason. That can manifest<br/>\nitself in many different ways -- people talking shop instead of<br/>\nplaying, joking instead of crying (or whatever was intended),<br/>\netc. A good session requires at least that the players connect<br/>\nwith the material and that the players and GM connect and manage<br/>\nto work together in acting everything out.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what you are after, really.

An old manifesto that I don't remember. (Was there ever a manifesto on Jeepform?) But I still believe the GM should have complete authority. I just don't think there are many cases you would use it. For me, the GM is an informed audience and helps the players coordinate and has a birds-eye perspective that is hard to keep when you're also playing characters. But knowing that the GM has complete authority <strong>and responsibility</strong> makes things easier, and the help the  players relax.</p>\n<p>So, Burbank, eh? I hope to be able to attend JiffyCon in November, and definitely in January. In about a month, I'll be based in Indiana, which is probably out of driving range.

In my experience, tabletop gets tighter and more focused the fewer players that are involved.  Recent games like <i>Polaris</i> and <i>Breaking the Ice</i> have caught on to this and mandated the number of players who can be involved, giving them specific roles and responsibilities.  American larp design, which is at a very different place than Nordic larp design (this is just my understanding, since this isn't my area), tends to operate on a much larger scale, where 100 people is not unusual.  This is just completely inconceivable for tabletop, unless you count "analogue MMORGs" like Living Greyhawk, but, even then, you don't have 100 different players interacting at the same time, they're split into various groups and only mix it up over the course of multiple games.<br/><br/>How many players is "normal" for a Jeep game?  When you say you try to mix up the guidelines you operate under, does that include widely varying numbers of players?  Have you played a Jeep game with 2 or 3 players?  Is there a minimum for these kinds of games to operate successfully or be fun?  Is there an upper limit?<br/><br/>My other questions have to do with the scope of stories and play.  Recently, there's been a move towards more extensive "campaign framing" rules in Anglo-American small press games.  <i>Burning Empires</i> is probably the most prominent example of this, where there are 4 major phases that can be played out, with each one taking 3 sessions or so (at least, as I recall).  This is kind of a middle ground between games like <i>The Mountain Witch</i> and <i>My Life With Master</i> that are meant to end after 3-4 sessions and the traditional open-ended campaign.  <i>Primetime Adventures</i> is also a good example, where play is broken down into "episodes" and "seasons" like a TV series, or <i>Grey Ranks</i>, which takes place in a dozen sessions, with each session representing a specific moment in the history of the Warsaw Uprising.<br/><br/>So... does Jeep deal in multiple sessions and extended play at all?  Seems like, most of the times I read about Nordic larp, they're mostly one-shots or games that take place over a single weekend.  They're not games that you continue every week.  This could be a total misconception on my part, I don't know, influenced by reading too many Knutepunkt con books.  If you do do extended play, how does that change how you approach setting up a game?  Also, and this is a question that really interests me in freeform, do you change the rules over the course of play, since the needs of the game may change over the course of the campaign?  That seems like a natural extension of the idea that the rules need to be tailored to the game, i.e. tailoring the rules to particular sessions of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96295/#Comment_96295" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T08:27:29+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  8:27AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 9:49AM by Matthijs.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>This is definitely an acute problem for us, because just reading the material and trying it out feels a little like building a cargo cult.  </blockquote>\nThat's what it feels like to sit here in Norway and try to understand American indie games <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96299/#Comment_96299" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T08:37:47+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  8:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>This summer, I got a chance to dabble in the arcane arts of<a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/" rel="nofollow">jeep form</a>role playing.<br/><br/>The opportunity came when I went to Ropecon in Finland. While there, I was asked a lot of questions by Finns, Swedes and many others who were intrigued but suspect of the Forgian emphasis on heavy mechanical structure in our game design.  The jeeps among them. But when I got a chance to play a jeep game, it was alien, yet strangely familiar. Like they had a lot of the same goals, but were doing things in the most different ways possible from forge--and its relations/diaspora--style of play.  Along with some dangerous agendas.</blockquote>\nI'm writing this before reading the thread, so it may be redundant. But, it's funny: it's always Forge-style Narrativism that i think of has strangely alien. Specifically, while i believed System Does Matter probably 5 years before Ron wrote that essay, i'm still not sold on the notion that the way in which it matters is that it has to do all the work. My gut reaction is that system's job is to get the hell out of the way except when absolutely necessary--and that story structure isn't somewhere that it's absolutely necessary, because we, the players, can provide that all by ourselves. And so when i read and play most Forge-influenced games, especially the explicitly-Narrativist ones, my gut reaction is "this isn't Narrativism [as defined by the Big Model]; this is an equal blend of Narrativism and Gamism"--i can't quite figure out what all these mechanics are doing here, if the goal is a Narrativist game. <br/><br/>Thus, when i discovered the Jeepform stuff a little while ago, it was like rediscovering very familiar stuff--it's like what i remember talking about on r.g.f.advocacy a decade ago, but more organized. Plus, to me, less mechanics is more natural, and the more complex the mechanics, the more artificial the RPing. And part of why I've liked your games, specifically, so much, so far, is they feel relatively non-intrusive, mechanically. So it's very funny to hear you refer to Jeepform, even tongue-in-cheek, as an "arcane art".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96375/#Comment_96375" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T15:39:35+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  3:39PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Woodelf!<br/>\n<br/>\nI read some times ago a interesting article about this,  written by Joshua BishopRoby:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://kallistipress.com/blog/?p=101" rel="nofollow">RPGs, Pulleys, and Microwave Ovens</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt's about "Design what Matter" and "Design what doesn't Matter".

They don't let you "play as you would do without rules" and I consider this a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another discussion Tobias (that can correct me if I misunderstood what he said at the time) told me that he usually play with "design what doesn't matter" when he play freeform improvised games "When playing just for fun, to kill time with fellow Jeepers", but when he design published scenarios (like "Doubt" or "the Upgrade") he goes to the first kind of design, and write rules that push the players to go beyond their limits.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's interesting that you instead see these kind of design (the narrativistic forgean one and published jeepform) as opposed and not similer, and I would like to ask Tobias for other comments about the similarity (and differences) that he see in the use of "rules" between jeepform and the forgean narrativistic games that he played (letting go of the dice/no-dice discussion that it's already happening elsewhere, I am talking now about rules in a more extensive sense, like "Say Yes or Roll the dice", fan mail, keys, and "only one between Tom and Julia can betray the other")<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Jonathan:<br/>\nI don't know how many scenario the Jeep produced, but they put freely awailable English traslation of nine of them at this page:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://jeepen.org/games/" rel="nofollow">http://jeepen.org/games/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96384/#Comment_96384" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T16:19:13+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  4:19PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 4:37PM by Emily_Care.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Nat. <br><br><i>Thus, when i discovered the Jeepform stuff a little while ago, it was like rediscovering very familiar stuff--it's like what i remember talking about on r.g.f.advocacy a decade ago, but more organized.</i><br>yay, advocacy! narrativism is very far from dramatism.

Doubt is not a game about coming out or fighting hetero-normativity but about partner-relationsships.<br/><b>\xc2\xa73 What happens in Paris, stays in Paris</b><br/>Interpret that however you want. Our interpretation is that possible flirts in Paris will be secret, that any mending effects on a relationship a trip to Paris may have will cease when back home again and that the love the bartender girl felt for Tom in Paris cools off once she is back behind the bar disk, serving beers again.<br/><b>\xc2\xa74 At least a two-scene build-up</b><br/>This means that there must be at least two scenes with a temptation before Tom or Julia may fall. As the game is also about what it means to fall for a temptation, we leave it to you to define what that means. It is your game.<br/><b>\xc2\xa75 At most one trip to Paris</b><br/>Of the scenes created by the players in the prepatory phase, at most one may take place in Paris.<br/><b>\xc2\xa76 Only characters and places from the lists</b><br/>This means that no characters and places other than those on the lists may be used in the scenes created in the prepatory phase. If it turns out that the bartender girl needs a boyfriend, or that Tom must be bullied by a paparazzi, that might be okay, but try to avoid it and rely on the given characters. Note that fast scenes don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t suffer by these rules.<br/><b>\xc2\xa77 Linear time</b><br/>Only the game master may introduce flash backs and dream sequences.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96407/#Comment_96407" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T18:36:27+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  6:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 6:48PM by Tobias Wrigstad.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Looking at the rules for Doubt again, rule <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> reads like partner relationsships require heterosexuality.

I actually got to play, Moreno, that's why I was so surprised. I have read your account to, but my experience over-rode what I read. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I only had the rules read to me, so I think not all of them sank in as deeply as they could have. And once we got under way, I was feeling loyalty to what would be told, so forgot that constraint.  It does change it in retrospect.  <br/><br/>I also remember offering a strong temptation for Tom *before* I'd been told to--during the warm-up phase rather than during the true beginning phase--but we were pressed for time, and when I got to play the character for whom I saw the strongest potential for destructive temptation, I went for it.  Also, I realized later, that particular temptation (a good job that Julia was *not* a part of) took hold, I felt like offering other sexual temptations would interfere with it's playing out--or rather, just be superfluous in the face of it, so my take on all the other characters I played was to use them to put pressure on that first issue I'd introduced.  These are my story gamer instincts showing through. So, I drifted my play of the game.  It may have been responsible for the "warping" of it that Markus commented on in your blog, Tobias.  <br/><br/>Bad gamer, Emily. Not using the written rules. <br/><br/>And, wow, 12 hours of consecutive play is not long. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Timescales another type of difference. It was, of course, also a single session game as most (though certainly not all) larps are. Most jeep forms are single session, though, yes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96691/#Comment_96691" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T19:41:41+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  7:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Tobias, I have some questions about size and how that affects<br/>\n  design and play.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Hi, Jonathan. Great questions. I completely agree that less<br/>\nplayers make for a tighter and more focussed game. This is a point<br/>\nI've been making for a long time.</p>\n<p>So, how many players is normal for a Jeep game? I'd say between 3<br/>\nand 8. Plus 0-2 GM's. There are instances of 2-player games, but<br/>\nthat's quite rare, and for stupid reasons, no such games have ever<br/>\nbeen written up in the style needed to run them at a con. The<br/>\nUpgrade! is a 6-8 player game (3 or 4 couples), but it could scale<br/>\neven higher I suspect. No sign of Alex is a 8 player game dividing<br/>\nthe players into two groups of 4 characters playing the same<br/>\ncharacters in the same room but 12 years apart. Doubt is a 4<br/>\nplayer game (two couples). Travellers is a 3 player game. (I was a<br/>\nbig fan of 3 players for a while.) Just to name a few. 4-6 I think<br/>\nis most common.</p>\n<p>Two player games work but are generally more stressful for the<br/>\nplayers -- more screen-time per person, so to speak. For dynamics,<br/>\nthree is a lot better.</p>\n<p>I've played Slivovica, a completely unserious train-ride through<br/>\nJugoslavia, with as many as 18 players, which worked quite OK, but<br/>\nin my experience, things tend to gravitate towards larp when<br/>\nyou've got more than 10 players, unless you have a very rigid<br/>\nstructure that makes it possible for all players to keep track of<br/>\nwhat's going on without becoming boring. All in all, 3-8 is my<br/>\npreference.</p>\n<p>(We did have about 150 people when we played The Upgrade! at<br/>\nRopeCon in 2006, but that was cheating.)</p>\n<p>On the question of multiple sessions, the answer is yes, but not<br/>\nso much. I've done pretty long-lasting (about 15 sessions is long<br/>\nin my book) freeform campaigns. But I'm not a campaign guy. I<br/>\ndon't have enough time and am too scatter-brained to not want to<br/>\nchange everything completely every 2-3 sessions.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>most of the times I read about Nordic larp, they're mostly<br/>\n  one-shots or games that take place over a single<br/>\n  weekend. They're not games that you continue every week</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I'm not really a larper, so I couldn't really tell you about<br/>\nthat. I think you are correct, but then again, there is a lot<br/>\ngoing on in the forest that I would not know about. I think there<br/>\nare fantasy campaigns as well as vampire campaign stuff. These<br/>\npeople don't read the Knutepunkt books. Sadly, there isn't a lot<br/>\nof interaction between fantasy larpers and "art-house larpers".<br/>\nAFAIK, art-house larps are generally one-shots, and I think those<br/>\nare the ones most likely to be described in the Knutepunkt<br/>\nbooks.</p>\n<p>Changing the rules over the course of play is something that I've<br/>\ndone several times, for example in the form of talking about what<br/>\ntechniques we should use tonight to bring out what we want in this<br/>\nsession. And this will vary over time.</p>\n<p>Generally, the people I play with are experienced freeform<br/>\nplayers, which means that we don't really have to talk so much<br/>\nabout this stuff. Things evolve quite organically, and at some<br/>\npoint something might happen and someone will say "let's make that<br/>\na rule!" or it effectively becomes so. That's happened on a few<br/>\noccasions. But I personally really don't do much extended play, so<br/>\nI cannot give you a really good answer on this one.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

For example, there's a <i>lot</i> of talk about <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/doubt" rel="nofollow">Doubt</a> and its essentially realistic tone, but less about something like <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/wolv" rel="nofollow">White Out: Las Vegas</a> and none at all about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil:_Extinction" rel="nofollow">zombies attacking a convoy of post-apocalyptic warriors</a>.  The last being the sort of thing that many RPers like to see in their games.<br/><br/>This is not an attack on <a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/" rel="nofollow">Jeepform</a>'s general bias toward reality, but I have to wonder if there's genuine potential for it to spread into other kinds of stories and genres.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98347/#Comment_98347" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T17:23:36+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  5:23PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Southpaw, <br/><br/>I think this is mostly a consequence of my own preferences, and not so much a limit or particular strength of Jeepform. <br/>**I** prefer social (sur)realism over vampires, Elvii, and zombies, but I would like to think that you could do most things jeep style. For example, we played a somewhat jeep-esque by Andrea Castellani today (I'm at ModCon in Italy) which was set in the stone age and me playing a warrior. <br/><br/>If I remember correctly, Ken Hite commented on our "Nuts and bolts of Jeepform" talk at RopeCon last year that most of our stuff can be used in table-top role-playing (in the American tradition), and that the techiniques are very modular -- you can just add one, or two if you like, you don't have to buy the whole package, so to speak. This is an (albeit very anecdotal and name-dropping) indication that jeepform applies to whatever you want to apply it to. <br/><br/>I'll try to point Olle (the White-out author) in the direction of this thread. <br/><br/>There will be no zombies though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98350/#Comment_98350" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T18:17:40+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  6:17PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tobias Wrigstad</cite>If I remember correctly, Ken Hite commented on our "Nuts and bolts of Jeepform" talk at RopeCon last year that most of our stuff can be used in table-top role-playing (in the American tradition), and that the techiniques are very modular -- you can just add one, or two if you like, you don't have to buy the whole package, so to speak.</blockquote>\nThis is pretty much the impression I've gotten thus far, but as much fun as discussing theory is (and I'm serious when I say that), I'm also interested in application.  That's why I've asked about such things as the how-and-why of scene framing and now about wider genre use.<br/><br/>I'm probably not too far off the mark when I say that fully 99.9% of all roleplayers tend to go bigger than life when they have that option, and games of the type we enjoy certainly do.  There's a hint of these possibilities in the aforementioned <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/wolv" rel="nofollow">White-Out: Las Vegas</a> and also in the very cool-sounding <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/hostage" rel="nofollow">Hostage!</a>, which I don't think has been brought into the discussion yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4237/jeep-invasion-q-a" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4237/jeep-invasion-q-a" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4237/jeep-invasion-q-a/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4237%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4237%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
