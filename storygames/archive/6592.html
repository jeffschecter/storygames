It seems that these various editions have drifted quite far from AD&amp;D2nd and D&amp;D Red Box in terms of game system... and even intent. (kind of away and then back towards wargaming it seems). <br/>\n<br/>\nNow what I was thinking about is what makes D&amp;D4th ed not a Fantasy Heart Breaker? It seems to fulfill many of the requirements (certainly not a first publish, but then again I don't know who wrote it (I assume many of you all do). But is seems like many of the games on my self it trying to D&amp;D better than D&amp;D. The settings have changed, the classes seemed to have changed or been altered significantly, the rule system sounds very different (after all the new generation no longer knows what a THAC0 is, not that I could ever calculate the hits myself [Hidden shame!]). <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of all it seems that they are trying to recapture the mood and feel of the D&amp;D "experience" that we all (some/most/any?) had when we first started playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo is it is it not a Fantasy Heartbreaker? <br/>\n<br/>\nI am ambivalent about the game, after all I have seen four* of my other favorite systems/settings stripped refitted and released in new an improved versions, which did not improve them too much in my mind, and I am getting relatively uninterested in updating my library to play games I already like (never fear though...I spend my money buying games that I might like from the small publishers), and I stopped updating my D&amp;D Library when dark sun went under. <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________<br/>\nJason<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Shadowrun 3rd, Cthulhu 5th, World of Darkness (actually new system is pretty good), and umm... right Legend of the 5 Rings 2nd. Note that most of these are not first editions... so that probably makes me some sort of hypocrite or something... or a stick in the mud... I am not even 30, am I turning into a Gonard?!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146384/#Comment_146384" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T08:39:49+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  8:39AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Written By: Ron Edwards, in his essay "Fantasy Heartbreakers"</cite>In the late 70s, this wasn't unreasonable. By the early 90s, though, things were considerably different. This essay is about some 1990s games I'm calling "fantasy heartbreakers," which are truly impressive in terms of the drive, commitment, and personal joy that's evident in both their existence and in their details - yet they are also teeth-grindingly frustrating, in that, like their counterparts from the late 70s, they represent but a single creative step from their source: old-style D&amp;D. And unlike those other games, as such, they were doomed from the start.<br/>...<br/>Perhaps I'm just a big meanie for expecting more (1) critical perspective of the intervening history of game design, (2) knowledge of actual fantasy instead of gaming-fantasy, (3) originality of concepts in mechanics, and (4) business acumen.</blockquote>\nPoints in order:<br/>1) It sounds like the 4E team went into this with a very good perspective on modern RPG design, creating a focused, fun adventure game.<br/>2) Okay, it might fall down on this one. On the other hand, D&amp;D <i>is</i> gaming fantasy, so it's hard to make a good claim that it is imitating itself.<br/>3) Sounds like there's lots of cool new mechanical design to me.<br/>4) The chances that 4E is not going to sell many, many copies seem pretty slim to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146387/#Comment_146387" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T08:49:27+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  8:49AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2008 8:50AM by renatoram.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not only that, but a Heartbreaker by definition should be the product of some dedicated DnD-only player/GM wanting to "change the world" using his brand new concept and rules... only to discover that if he had looked at other games he'd known that his "brand new" ideas were already everywhere.<br/>\n(for example: my game has, like... NO CLASSES!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe designers of 4E instead seem to know very well what else it out there, and have embraced the new concepts in large part.<br/>\n<br/>\n...heck, I'm leafing the KOTS quick start rules, and on the very first page it says<br/>\n<br/>\n"To play, you need a DM to present challenges, adjudicate the rules, and narrate the adventure."

They are created as a labor of love by a small group of designers (or a single designer) with little to no experience of role-playing games beyond the game they are trying to "fix." They typically more or less recreate the rules of the game they are trying to fix, with one or two genuine innovations. Beyond that, the truly heartbreaking thing is that the designers often have little understanding of the three-tier distribution model, and wind up sinking small fortunes into printing thousands of copies of their game and then lose their shirts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146513/#Comment_146513" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T16:29:48+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  4:29PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The heart was already broken by old D&amp;D edition, for a lot of people, it seems.
