There could be any sort of stupid flaws that I can't be arsed to check for myself starting with missing pages and ending with some sort of font problems, so it's best if such an usability tester would bother to outright read the booklet through from the pdf, or at least most of it. That way you can also tell me if the font size and landscape layout work in screen reading, or whether I need to improve the basic solutions somehow before starting to sell the file.<br/><br/>If you want to help out, let me know your email address, and I'll send the file over once I've finished tinkering with the bookmarks. I'll be happy with 1-3 different people looking this over, the rest of the possibly interested folks get to pay me for my bother later - I'll make the file available once I've been told that it works fine.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177768/#Comment_177768" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T09:03:08+00:00" title="November  8, 2008  9:03AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got two volunteers, which is fine, unless somebody absolutely needs to get in.
