My character turned out to be this sort of weird assassin who was "uploaded" from Earth into a spare body on Mars. I had some important job to do there, but I don't know what it was. The group sorta blew up after that game and we never finished, but that game rocked and had a lot of potential. We killed Rob's character, the colony's police sheriff in his second scene, but it was fine (we thought) because he had a brain backup that he reloaded into another body. (Turns out Rob was pretty put off by it, but he didn't say so during play.) <br/><br/>The second time was last Thursday. I went over to Daniel Levine's house with some awesome barbecue. After dinner, he and I did one-on-one role-play using the Annalise rules. We agreed to a modern, rural setting in unspecified Farm Country, America. I am playing Willard, a 68-year-old retiree who hasn't gotten over the death of his wife 25 years ago. Daniel is playing Willard's granddaughter Maura, a chubby emo girl. Play is turning into this weird supernatural mystery. Willard got a visit from his wife's ghost at the library. He found a very old book with a very new FedEx bill-of-lading that traced back to Kansas. Maura got chased around the gym changing room by a shadowy figure. We've been claiming things like "the phone rings" and "scratching sounds" and "papers addressed to you" and "rotting food."<br/><br/>In one awesome scene, Willard's daughter is yelling at him for not going to the doctor. Daniel pushes the moment with the consequence: Willard has a heart attack. I choose the achievement: My daughter stops harassing me. After playing a claim for a reroll, the dice go my way (whew) and I escape the heart attack.<br/><br/>In another scene, Willard is trying to convince his daughter Evelyn to drive him to Kansas to investigate the weird FedEx bill. He's laid it all out for Evelyn and she thinks he's crazy. Consequence: Willard is committed to a mental institution. Achievement: Evelyn believes Willard about his wife's ghost. The dice are not kind at first. Both Daniel and I burn up 3-4 claims each. In the end, Willard avoids being institutionalized and Evelyn is on his side. The whole thing plays out as a nightmarish trip to Dr. Adler's. The office has dreamlike qualities, like a door that leads into an impossible basement. There are ringing phones and boxes of rotting food. Willard and Evelyn never make it all the way to the office, though; it was a shared dream experience they had during a car accident.<br/><br/>Daniel has similarly awesome scenes for Maura.<br/><br/>I've said this since the beginning: Annalise is a very subtle and powerful game. I didn't understand how it worked until I saw Nathan play it with some other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220926/#Comment_220926" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T08:11:09+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  8:11AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2009 8:11AM by Andy.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.<br/><br/>Sold.<br/><br/>EDIT: MORE, plz.

Here's a description of how the game works.<br/><br/><b>Vampire</b><br/><br/>Annalise is ostensibly a "vampire" game. It refers to "The Vampire" throughout the rules but makes it clear what it means by the term. The Vampire is a metaphor for some needy creature or being. It could be a literal vampire with bloodsucking minions. It could be a demon. It could be a powerful but otherwise normal human being who has a dark interest in the characters. In the game I'm play, I think the Vampire is some kind of ghost. That's the thing, you never really talk about what the Vampire is. You let it come out in play. A lot of Annalise is that way: emergent fiction.<br/><br/><b>Characters</b><br/><br/>Character creation is intimidatingly simple. You have two core traits, Vulnerability and Secret, a trait called Reserves, and satellite traits that relate back to one of the core traits or the other. You have a name. During play, you collect Claims. That's all there is to currency in this game.<br/><br/>To start play, you need only a name and a Vulnerability (freeform answer to "I am vulnerable because..."). You demonstrate your Vulnerability in your first scene, before bothering with Secrets or coins or anything else.<br/><br/>You have a Secret (freeform answer to "No one knows that..."), hidden from other players. You distribute 13 coins across these two traits. In most games, players write possible secrets on slips of paper, fold them up, and then redistribute them randomly. In the two-player game I am in, we authored our own Secrets. <br/><br/>Characters also have Reserves, which is a pile of coins you can use to buy Claims (more later) and bolster core traits.<br/><br/><b>Claims</b><br/><br/>Throughout play, you're making Claims. A claim is ownership of some concrete element of the setting, like "a knock at the door" or "papers addressed to you." You claim elements that others introduce in their narration. Each claim is recorded (we use post-it notes) and you put some coins on it. During play, you can narrate-in the element of a claim and use one of its coins to meddle with someone else's conflict.<br/><br/><b>Play Overview</b><br/><br/>You take turns being the active player. There's no dedicated GM role. Other players take turns being the scene GM ("story guide") for the active player. <br/><br/>Play is divided into phases. The rules change in small ways between phases. <br/><br/>In <i>Discovering Characters</i>, players introduce their characters and their Vulnerabilities. There are no dice conflicts. Players make lots of claims on elements in the fiction, more freely than in later phases.<br/><br/>In <i>Laying the Foundations</i>, players build up the story a bit and flesh out their characters with satellite traits linked either to Vulnerability or Secret. This is the main chunk of play. Claims are more limited but the rules encourage every player to make at least one per scene. If your Vulnerability drops to 0, then the Vampire gets some kind of hold over you (this has mechanical teeth). If your Secret falls to 0, you have to reveal your character's secret in full (and you can't raise it back up). During conflicts, you get to create satellite traits off your core traits.<br/><br/>In <i>The Confrontation</i>, the characters face the Vampire (which may be a real vampire or something else; more later). You no longer get to create satellite traits during conflicts. You no longer make claims. You can now "flip" a satellite trait for a reroll of one or more outcome dice. Flipping a trait changes it to a mirror reflection of it (positive to negative, and vice versa). You can reveal your Secret, reduce it to 0 coins, and flip all of your outcome dice to 3's and 4's, and end a conflict. Additionally, every conflict has a default (and free) Consequence, "You give in to the Vampire," with starting value equal to 4 minus the number of holds on you.<br/><br/>In <i>The Aftermath</i>, players explore the consequences of the confrontation with the vampire and wrap up the story. There are no conflicts or claims. Players showcase their flipped traits, how the Vampire controls them or does not, and so on. It's denouement.<br/><br/>continued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221115/#Comment_221115" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T08:52:12+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  8:52AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2009 8:54AM by Adam_Dray.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Conflicts</b><br/><br/>Conflicts are very cool. Either the story guide "pushes" a conflict ("Moment") on the active player, or the active player "seizes" the conflict. <br/><br/>In either case, the active player defines an Achievement (what he wants to gain from the conflict) and the story guide defines a Consequence (a bad thing that may happen to the character). The player describes how he's using his Secret or Vulnerability, usually creates a satellite trait linked to that main trait, moves some coins into the new trait (and the coins sorta multiply here, since gain = 2*spend+1), then spends coins for consequences and achievements. Right off the bat, the active player is in for 2 coins, but he can create additional achievements (and the story guide can create additional consequences to match). <br/><br/>The active player rolls a d6 for every consequence and achievement. We record the consequences and achievements on post-its and put the rolled die right on the paper it belongs to. <br/><br/>Then you consult a little chart. It lists the outcome for consequences 1-6 and achievements 1-6. Low numbers are bad for the active player and high numbers are good for the active player, for both consequences and achievements. The chart is like this:\n<table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><b>Roll</b></td><td><b>Achievement</b></td><td><b>Consequence</b></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>You don't even come close to gaining the achievement.</td><td>The consequence happens with full force. Either spend a coin out of the core trait or let the scene guide create another Consequence with a 3.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You do not gain the achievement.</td><td>The consequence happens. Spend an additional coin.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>You may come close, but you don't gain the achievement.</td><td>The consequence happens, but only partially. After the conflict, add 1 coin to your reserves.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>You gain the achievement.</td><td>You avoid the consequence barely. After the conflict, add 1 coin to your reserves.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>You gain the achievement handily. Add a coin to your trait.</td><td>You avoid the conflict. After the conflict, add 1 coin to your reserves.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Your achievement has an unexpectedly positive outcome.  Either add a coin to the core trait or create a new achievement with a 4.</td><td>You completely avoid the consequence.  After the conflict, add 1 coin to your reserves.</td></tr></table>\nThe active player gets the first chance to spend claims to modify the results. One coin off a claim buys you the right to do a couple different things to one of the dice on a result:\n<ul><li>spend 1 coin to reroll any die</li><li>spend N coins to raise or lower a die by N</li><li>spend 1 coin to write a new consequence or achievement (roll a new die for it)</li><li>spend 2 coins to create a new consequence or achievement with a 3 or 4 (your choice) on it</li><li>sacrifice (destroy) a claim with no coins to get 2 coins to spend, as above</li></ul>\nOnce the active player meddles with the dice, you go around the table and everyone gets a chance to meddle. Same rules apply. The active player can then stop meddling and accept what has happened, or she can meddle again, but this opens up another pass around the table.<br/><br/>While spending coins of claims, players are narrating-in the claim, the active player is reacting, and so on. <br/><br/>And that's the general gist of play. I skimmed over some stuff like holds and the coin economy, but I think I explained enough to show how play works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221117/#Comment_221117" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T08:55:51+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  8:55AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll write what I think is cool about all that in a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221130/#Comment_221130" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T09:34:40+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  9:34AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's why I think all those rules make awesome play.<br/><br/><b>Characters are simple and discovered through play.</b> <br/><br/>All you need to start is some agreement on setting and genre, a basic character idea, a name, and your vulnerability. Secrets are generated by other players (usually). You generate your satellite traits one at a time, one per conflict. <br/><br/>Daniel and I had a brief discussion that determined that we wanted to try a pretty normal, modern setting, but rural instead of urban. Daniel grew up in upstate New York. I grew up in northeastern Ohio. We're no strangers to farm country and small towns and cities. The first couple minutes of play can be a little halting because you don't have anything to play off; however, if you just relax and go with your stream of consciousness, stuff happens.<br/><br/>I decided I wanted to play an old retiree. I invented Willard. His Vulnerability was "I am vulnerable because I haven't gotten over my wife's death, 25 years ago." That is all I knew about him when we started role-playing. After the first <i>Discovering Characters</i> scenes, we made up secrets. We authored our own since it was a 2-player game. Daniel will read this, so I won't say what I wrote. Ha.<br/><br/><br/><b>Claims are social rewards that create repeating themes.</b><br/><br/>When you claim an element, you are saying that you thought it was cool. That's instant feedback to the other player that you are grooving on their narration. <br/><br/>Moreover, later on, you get to spend coins off that claim to meddle with another player's conflict. To do this, you have to narrate the element you claimed into play to show how it changes the outcome of a consequence or achievement. The element is repeated and it becomes a common thread in the story. <br/><br/>For example, there's a "rotten food" claim in my game with Daniel. Daniel introduced it. I didn't claim it immediately, but I did reuse the idea in my own narration later on. Daniel claimed it then. Rotten food has been appearing in our story as an evil omen. In one scene the father of Maura, Daniel's teenage character, is packing for a business trip. He goes to put something in his suitcase and sees that it's full of rotting food, and slams it shut before Maura can see it. It's a bizarre reaction and I'm not sure Daniel or I really know where it's going, but somehow it'll make sense later. <br/><br/><br/><b>The conflicts can have real teeth.</b><br/><br/>Annalise isn't the only game like this. Other games like Dogs in the Vineyard and Sorcerer have mechanics which make it possible for players to push as hard as they can in conflicts. Annalise and Dogs do this via an escape hatch. <br/><br/>In Annalise, the outcome is this wiggly thing that you get to fight over with coins from claims. A consequence may start out with a 1 (bad stuff is going to happen AND it's gonna cost you an additional coin, OR the story guide is gonna add another consequence for you to deal with), but you can buy it off pretty easily. As a result, I find that after a while, Daniel and I were pretty happy to do really awful things to each other in play.<br/><br/>In one conflict, Daniel threw down the consequence, "Willard has a heart attack." In another, he pushed "Dr. Adler institutionalizes Willard." I really didn't want that to happen. I fought with every fiber of my being, and Daniel pushed back really hard. Eventually, as we were both running out of claims with coins, Daniel rerolled the consequence, which had a 5 on it, and got another 5. I decided not to push my luck any further and accepted it there (in my favor).<br/><br/>In another conflict, I pushed on Daniel, "Maura burns down the house." And it turned out that Daniel thought that was cool and let the dice fall where they may on that one. Maura threw a kick-ass party while her parents were out of town -- the achievement Daniel wrote -- but they burned down the house in the process.<br/><br/><br/><b>The game is creepy.</b><br/><br/>I've only played twice and watched once, but each time play was dark, mysterious, and pretty creepy. It's creepy in the way a ouija board is. Stuff is happening in the story that you didn't expect -- that no one expected -- because it's emerging out of the synergy of everyone's pushing and pulling. A lot of details are being left out. A lot of questions are unanswered. In most cases, no one has the answers. They just threw out some mysterious detail to be figured out later. It all seems to work out.<br/><br/>Players do have to work to tie up loose ends. At one point, Daniel had Willard discover this old wooden shelf of books in the records archive of his local library. It wasn't there before and Willard knew every inch of that records room. I asked for the achievement, "Willard figures out where the books came from." Eventually I won that achievement, and we were forced to answer the question. I dragged my feet on answering it myself. I made Daniel do it as scene guide. He had introduced it, and I wanted him to tell me where it came from. Turns out, my wife's ghost was to blame.<br/><br/>There was a point where I wasn't sure if Willard was crazy or not. I wasn't sure if he was living a schizophrenic nightmare or if stuff was real. I'm still not entirely sure. That's pretty creepy. I suspect that he isn't because I've been narrating ghosty stuff for Daniel's character. If we're both seeing stuff, it has to be real, right?

I loved the fact that we were leaning towards a certain NPC as a the Vampire but then decided late in the game it was simply a manipulation and someone else was being a puppetmaster.<br/><br/>If I had a strike against the game it was that there are too many economies in the game and too much to keep track of in terms of chips -- the game could be streamlined and my g.f. and I came up with simple ideas to do that.<br/><br/>Otherwise, huge recommendation for Annalise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221224/#Comment_221224" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T16:13:17+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  4:13PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2009 4:13PM by Elizabeth.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Annalise is one of my favorite games of all time, and I hate spooky horror games. But Annalise is engrossing and-- well, exactly how Adam describes. It gets in your head. It's been a long time since I played it, but that's something I'd really like to change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
