I had an idea for a system a few days ago and wrote it up last night. Resolution is mostly through player voting based on the roleplaying.  My original concept was for the characters to have a bunch of skills, which they would roll against at various points, but I now think that would be rather clunky, and would be likely to impede the flow of what is essentially a knockabout \u2018nutty professor\u2019 type game.

Eggs? What is it with you and eggs? You\u2019re obsessed with eggs.</i> He looks over at the GM, and asks if the shop has eggs. The GM  replies <i>Yes, there are several boxes on the counter behind you</i>, at which Fermi whirls round, grabs the boxes, opens them, and starts randomly throwing eggs at Tesla, who after a few seconds pushes Fermi back against some shelving, which collapses onto the floor with Fermi joining it soon after. Tesla starts vainly trying to rub the egg mess from his suit and cursing Fermi, saying <i>Damn you Enrico, I just bought this suit last week, and now you\u2019ve ruined it</i>. <br/><br/>At which point Marie Curie enters, looks at Tesla wiping his suit, and says to him<i> I know what you need for that</i>.

All feedback is welcome grist to a game designer\u2019s mill, helping them as it does to crystallise their ideas about their game. I\u2019ll speak to your points directly, but before doing so I\u2019ll make a couple of observations. First, I think we\u2019re coming from quite different directions here, and that fundamentally <i>Great Minds</i> isn\u2019t your cup of tea (nothing wrong with that, most games are not for everyone), so I\u2019m not sure as to what extent I'll be able to overcome your objections to it. Secondly, as I say above, what you\u2019re seeing is only a first draft, and is subject to potentially radical change during playtesting. \n<blockquote>So I get the joke here, of using terribly interesting people to tell the most banal stories imaginable, but I'm struggling to understand what keeps players engaged.</blockquote>\nIf it <i>was</i> a case of terribly interesting people telling the most banal stories imaginable it would indeed be unspeakably dull. But it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s more a case of fish out of water, i.e. people who have been to a large extent cosseted in their ivory towers previously, but who are now having to do things that are way outside their frame of reference. As to what keeps the players engaged, since players\u2019 motivations, likes and interests are extremely varied, and unpredictable session by session, I\u2019d struggle to explain how most of the games I know keep them engaged, so I won\u2019t attempt to answer that here.  \n<blockquote>From first reading, the voting mechanic looks like a prompt to try and make each other laugh as much as possible. Problem is, the normal social incentives for this behavior are already so high that the voting structure is, I think, somewhere between superfluous and obstructive to the goal.</blockquote>\nThis kind of voting mechanic is becoming increasingly common nowadays, appearing as it does in games as diverse as Forsooth and Tenra Bansho Zero. It\u2019s not really about making each other laugh (although that may be a side-effect), it\u2019s more a way of giving players an incentive to actively roleplay their character.    \n<blockquote>What problem does the GM solve in this game? </blockquote>\nDoes there have to be a \u2018problem\u2019 that having a GM solves? Can\u2019t you just \u2018have a GM\u2019 who has role x, y or z? Assuming the latter, the GM\u2019s role is to set tasks for the players and assess the degree to which they have solved them, and to act as a provocateur, introducing NPCs that have the effect of wandering monsters, in other words to be a sort of puppet-master. He or she also is in charge of dishing out (or withholding) the d4s. However, someone on another forum suggested having a rotating GM, which I could definitely accept, and which is something that would help in games where there are only three players (including the facilitator). Part of my reply to that comment was that I\u2019d never been of the school of thought that says that all storygames must be GMless, but I'm fine with having GMlessness as an option for those who prefer that mode of play.    \n<blockquote>Basically, the most compelling version of this that I can imagine looks something like a Fiasco playset, and I'm wondering what you want this game to do beyond that. </blockquote>\nI don\u2019t want the game to <i>do</i> anything as such, I just want a game where players do stuff during it, which the players may or may not find enjoyable. Secondly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very helpful starting point in terms of game design to have a particular game (in this case Fiasco), which you map your own game onto to varying degrees, or shrink back from, or do slightly differently from, or go beyond or whatever. I think it\u2019s much better to just come up with an idea for a game, decide what you want the players to do, and come up with some mechanics to allow them to do that.     \n<blockquote>I also<del> don't hate </del> like the original idea of using some defined set of traits. Like, if each character has three skills, but they're all things like "planar algebra," and "string theory" there's comedy in hearing players justify of the use of these skills in everyday situations.</blockquote>\nNo, they\u2019ll still be there, in fact they\u2019ll be the bedrock of the char sheet, but my idea now is that, rather than have the players rolling against them during each scene, they\u2019ll use them as a basis for both the roleplaying and the solving of the tasks. <br/><br/>As I say, I think we\u2019re coming from different directions about both this game and game design in general, but thanks again for your comments, and I hope I\u2019ve gone some way towards answering the points you raised.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441145/#Comment_441145" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-03T18:01:41+00:00" title="January  3, 2015  6:01PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2015 5:28PM by catty_big.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Second <i>Great Minds</i> hack:<br/><br/><b>The Write Stuff</b><br/><br/>You play a group of Shakespearean playwrights who have fallen out of favour with the Court, have got into one too many tavern brawls, owe money left right and centre, and between you have got about a dozen girls pregnant (whose fathers are distinctly unimpressed and have been heard declaring that <i>If [they] get their hands on [you]\u2026</i> well, you get the picture.

When I play any game (narrative or otherwise), I have a character sheet with some stats and/or traits on it, and an idea of what\u2019s going to happen during the game, and when the game begins I simply roleplay my character in that situation. Take Fiasco (as I said earlier, I\u2019m reluctant to make comparisons with other games when talking about a game in progress, but it\u2019s a good analogy here so I\u2019ll go with it): when I play Fiasco I think up relationships with two other characters, I have a bunch of stuff available to me to springboard from- such as locations and McGuffins etc.- and that\u2019s it. What are the characters\u2019 motivations in Fiasco, other than to frame and/or resolve scenes involving them and the other characters in various locations throughout the game? \n<blockquote>As inspiration, the story "The Physicists" from the Swiss author Duerrenmatt comes to my mind: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physicists" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physicists</a></blockquote>\nGood spot, thanks, I\u2019ll check it out. \n<blockquote>Looking at the starting scenario in the <i>Sacre Bleu!</i> hack, it's much easier to see how this could be played. </blockquote>\nFantastic!

Maybe my writing is a bit opaque, but the answers to two of your questions are right there in the text, to whit:<br/><br/>1)\t<b>Who I am</b>: You\u2019re an eminent but slightly eccentric high-level scientist from the early C20, who for one reason or another has had to leave their home/job and re-establish themselves far from their home environment (in the section on <i>Scene Zero</i>, on pg4, I suggest some reasons why you might have left your home country). <br/>2)\t<b>Why my resources won\u2019t help me</b>: You\u2019re used to a life spent either in Academia, or at the very least working on what most people would consider to be a fairly abstruse field of study/research, probably having servants or lesser colleagues or family to help you navigate everyday life (referring to one of my examples- again on pg 4 of the text- it\u2019s pretty unlikely that either Einstein or Tesla would have been called upon to rescue a neighbour\u2019s lost cat), but now you find yourself having to undertake very mundane tasks. So your <i>resources</i> relate to your ability to bend your considerable intelligence to incredibly abstract problems, and thus may not be terribly well suited to your current situation. <br/><br/>As to your third question, I know a number of games nowadays (forex <i>Microscope</i>) have questions that have to be answered through play, but I\u2019m personally not keen on this mechanic (in fact, when I run <i>Microscope</i> I usually omit that aspect as it doesn\u2019t really help the narrative IMO), so it\u2019s not something that will be making an appearance in <i>Great Minds</i>. However, I can answer the first part: <b>What\u2019s at stake?</b> You know that at the end of the game you face a test of your performance during it- the example I give in the text is <i>Attend a society party and make a good impression</i>- which, if you\u2019ve managed to undertake the various in-game tasks successfully, you\u2019ll be in a good position to do, because you\u2019ll have amassed a high number of dice for the final roll. <br/><br/>Regarding hacks and playsets etc. (for which I already have ideas for one or two more), if one of them grabs you more than the setting of the base game then brilliant, play/run that instead! In fact, here\u2019s a challenge to you (and BeePeeGee, although I note from our recent conversation that your group would be unlikely to go for this sort of game): make up some character sheets for C18 French nobles, run <i>Sacre Bleu</i> and see what happens. I\u2019ll do the char sheets for you if that\u2019s easier <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Or try one of the alternatives you suggested above?   <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441184/#Comment_441184" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-05T17:40:37+00:00" title="January  5, 2015  5:40PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2015 5:40PM by catty_big.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/Character%20sheet%20%28Einstein%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">Character sheet</a><br/><br/>Bear in mind that this is purely an initial treatment, but it's the sort of direction I'm heading in.

Instructions for choosing or creating a scenario like "sacre bleu" or "the write stuff" ?</blockquote>\nOk, so I\u2019m definitely going to include in the book instructions for generating characters and playsets. Try this for size:<br/><br/><b>Premise</b><br/>The characters should have been forced to leave their previous environment for one reason or another. They could have been expelled by the local Lord, be fleeing a revolution, been sacked from their jobs, or have moved due to various unforeseen circumstances. Whatever the reason, they are now well out of their \u2018comfort zone\u2019, and having to try to get by in surroundings- and among people- that they don\u2019t understand, lack empathy for, or are in some other sense way beyond their previous frame of reference. <br/><br/><b>Character generation</b><br/>Character generation should be fairly pared down, with some characteristics relevant to the scenario type, for example the Great Minds of the title have education, career trajectory and notable successes (Nobel Prize etc.), whereas the French aristos of the <i>Sacre Bleu</i> playset have their previous position at court (such as Chancellor, Master of The Bedchamber etc.), jealousies and rivalries, what kind of estate and family they had in France and so on.  <br/><br/><b>Scene Zero</b><br/>Scene Zero places them in their new abode (whether poky flat, farmhouse, tenement building etc.), and again they will be the sort of people who would chafe at these new surroundings, with the claustrophobia perhaps engendering internal antipathies and flashpoints (over who should take out the rubbish or clean the oven, who\u2019s always leaving their socks drying on the hearth, and <i>Albert, <b>must,</b> you smoke that filthy pipe in here?</i>, and so on).<br/><br/><b>Tasks</b><br/>The tasks should ideally challenge the characters by forcing them to do things that stretch their patience with their new surroundings (and each other) to breaking point, or simply- as in the case of the scientists- be so mundane as to open up a yawning chasm between their previous experience (for example working out how gravity operates) and their current exigencies (getting a cat out of a tree, or a gravy stain out of a pair of trousers). Also, there should be plenty of scope for encountering NPCs, who could comprise anybody from passers-by, neighbours and local shopkeepers (or inn-keepers in the case of the Elizabethan playwrights) to Police officers, street sweepers or officials of one kind of another.  <br/><br/>However, right from the beginning the party should have explained to them the final goal, whether a party, or official engagement, or some other event, at which their performance will decide their ultimate fate, whether it be a high profile job in their new environment, or being able to return to their previous one, and for which their successes along the way will improve their chances (in the form of a gradually increasing dice pool).<br/><br/><b>Final scene</b><br/>This is the event at which the characters\u2019 fates are sealed, whether for good or ill. After rolling the dice pool they have accumulated by that point, the resulting score will determine who will succeed, and by how much. The players then roleplay their success or failure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442316/#Comment_442316" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-30T20:53:00+00:00" title="January 30, 2015  8:53PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2015 9:10PM by catty_big.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Double post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442317/#Comment_442317" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-30T20:58:40+00:00" title="January 30, 2015  8:58PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2015 4:49PM by catty_big.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In response to the following post on another forum, I came up with another hack, this time involving Graeco-Roman gods!<br/><br/><i>Are there currently any mechanics systems for player owned stores?
