My Hot War game on Monday night feel through at the last moment and our proposed Wednesday night game (or maybe it was going to be Thursday!) was undecided until the last moment. And what would we play?<br/><br/>Well the delay actually worked in our favour. Given <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7684" rel="nofollow">this announcement</a> by Matt Snyder, it was clear that we would have to play Dust Devils. Something of a small eulogy for Chimera Creative. From the point of view of someone who has enjoyed Matt's games, it's sad that he choosing to follow another path. However in many ways, it's exciting because Matt will be off doing other things that excite and invigorate him. Hopefully, he'll come back to producing games one day, even more creative and enthusiastic than before.<br/><br/>Anyhow, enough of the intro.<br/><br/>This game was interesting in another way. I've played with Per a lot but I've not seen Myles, our playing companion for the evening, in a long, long time. So it was good to catch up and have a chance to find out what has been going on over the last couple of years. <br/><br/>Prior to getting in to character creation, I outlined a basic, archetypal Western situation that I had doodled down on a couple of scraps of paper. The story would start in Big Bend, a river town where steamboat call, taking people and goods to and from the railhead at Logan Flat, two days downriver. Michael O'Donnell (known as 'The Gravedigger') was shackled up in jail having murdered a local family and the Marshall was on his way from Logan Flat to pick him up. Oh, and there was a $1000 bounty on his head.<br/><br/>I'd sketched out five NPCs, as follows:<br/><br/>Michael O'Donnell - A no-good killer, used to be something of a mummy's boy.<br/><br/>Blythe Walker - The Sheriff, one armed, hard as nails, knew the dead family<br/><br/>David O'Donnell - Brother of Michael, a wealthy, self-made man who put $500 towards the bounty on his brother.<br/><br/>Maureen O'Donnell - Mother of the O'Donnell boys, a compassionate but angry woman.<br/><br/>Katherine 'Kitty' Boyd - Former lover of David who also entrapped Michael with her feminine wiles. Now a lady of substance.<br/><br/>I asked Per and Myles to keep in mind four questions: How are you involved in this situation? Who out of the five NPCs are you most closely connected to? Why? What is you goal?<br/><br/>Per and Myles got down to creating the protagonists in this tale and ended up with the following:<br/><br/>Carl Pryce<br/><br/>Used to be a lawman, now a wanted man. He's as handsome as a prince and as cunning as a coyote. His weakness is greed. Huge greed.<br/><br/>His strongest connection as to Walker, the Sheriff. He's in town to collect a favour from him from when he rescued Walker from a fight. He just wants to get some cash.<br/><br/>Glen Eart<br/><br/>Used to be a horse thief, now he's a phoney preacher. He's as quick and lightning and could find gold in shit. He's driven by cold, black vengeance.<br/><br/>His strongest connection was to Michael O'Donnell. He cut up his mother, a madame, years ago and now Eart is here to cut him up and kill him. In that order.<br/><br/>The opening scene shows the high bluffs overlooking Big Bend, the trail winding down towards the town. Along this trots Eart on his pony. In the middle distance, three men crouch around a fire, brewing coffee. As he gets closer, Eart draws his rifle and guns them down, getting off his pony to dispatch the last man with a shot to the face. Turns out one of the boys was a confederate of Michael O'Donnell's. Bad luck for him.<br/><br/>We first meet Pryce in the Sheriffs office, with Walker making sure to hide the wanted posters with his old friends face on it in a drawer. The conversation is strained. Walker owes Pryce, but Pryce has a bounty on his head. Eventually, Walker is bullied into making Pryce a deputy and giving him $50 advance pay for guarding O'Donnell on the boat down to Logan Flat. Pryce pins his new badge on and goes in search of a bath.<br/><br/>The first two scenes really did establish very, very strongly the Devils for both characters. Myles made it clear that he wanted one of the men round the fire to be an associate of O'Donnell, so that's what it turned out to be. Gave him the perfect excuse to demonstrate how far Eart was willing to go in the name of revenge. The scene with Pryce was much less violent, Per playing him as quite a cool customer, but with a certain amount of desperation running beneath the surface.<br/><br/>One thing that struck me about this game was that, while I had a great time, I felt my scene framing was a little weak in many cases. The situation was strong, but could have framed some of the scenes a lot more aggressively to make the conflicts even stronger. Something to learn from, I feel.<br/><br/>There were scenes in the saloon and the bath tent, which is where Eart and Pryce finally met, soaking in baths next to each other. All very relaxing until David O'Donnell turns up with a proposition. Myles played Eart as outrageously insulting at this point, causing a conflict where O'Donnell gets two of his men to drag him (naked, of course) from his bath to administer a beating with their rifle butts. In quite an unexpected turn up for the books, Myles won the conflict, narrating how Eart beats the two men, clubbing them with their own rifles. All the while, the townspeople are aghast at this naked man causing trouble. Trouble indeed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171155/#Comment_171155" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T04:58:47+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  4:58AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We eventually got to the stage where O'Donnell asks the two men to kill his brother for $250 apiece. He wants it done on the boat, well out of town so as not to cause further heartache for his poor mother. He's a very caring, considerate son, for sure. Eart and Pryce agree (Eart because it allows him to get to kill O'Donnell and Pryce because he can't resist the money being waved in his face). Then they go off and play cards, with Pryce making out like a bandit (and beating Katherine Boyd) and Eart getting shafted by O'Donnell, who takes every last cent he has. Poor man.<br/><br/>The card game involving Eart and O'Donnell was actually the first time I had won a conflict since the game started and it was a big win (full house, I think). Myles had to scratch off a fair few points from his Scores because of it, losing face in front of  the saloon crowd and having his willpower grievously dented.<br/><br/>Now, we move to the boat, heading downriver. Michael O'Donnell is shacked up in the stoke hold, Eart is drinking heavily and Pryce is getting moves made on him by Katherine Boyd (well, he is as handsome as a prince, after all).<br/><br/>Boyd makes Pryce's head swim by offering him $5000 if he'll help O'Donnell escape to fin a strongbox he has hidden somewhere. Greed really takes hold and poor Pryce just can't say no. There wasn't even a conflict her, Per just agreed that Pryce would be swayed by the huge amount of money on offer. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Eart throws a man overboard...<br/><br/>This is where things started to really bloody, with greed, vengeance, betrayal and violence coming right to the surface. The conflicts from here on in were all strong and aggressive, really driving towards a dramatic end.<br/><br/>By hook and crook, Pryce frees O'Donnell but Eart has got wind of the fact that he doesn't want him dead. So, Eart tries to shoot Pryce dead to get to the object of his vengeance. That doesn't work out so well for him. Myles is pretty unlucky with the cards, while Per draws high. Eart ends up with half of his face and a chunk of the side of his head blown away and burned by the muzzle flash of a .45. He drops to the deck of the ship, screaming. <br/><br/>Trouble is, O'Donnell isn't for trusting anyone. He grabs the gun dropped by Eart and gets Pryce to strip out of his new suit, making off to the upper decks. There is going to be hell to pay.<br/><br/>Pryce races for Boyd's cabin while Eart, horribly disfigured and dripping blood, heads for the now closed bar to get some booze to ease his pain. He's going to need more than booze. <br/><br/>In Boyd's cabin, turns out O'Donnell is already there. The conflict goes badly for Per and I get one of my rare wins in the game! Badly wounded, he's kicked aside by O'Donnell, who opens the door and calmly guns down the four Deputy Marshals battering at the door with their scatterguns. <br/><br/>Dragging himself painfully down the corridor, leaving a trail of blood along the wall, Pryce tries to follow his tormentor, sure that he's heading for the small boat tethered at the back of the steamer. Trouble is, he only has one cartridge left in his gun. Eart is nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>I should point out that Pryce was reach The End at this point and Per had pretty much decided that the next conflict was going to be his last. He reaches the back of the boat to see O'Donnell and Boyd getting in to a small rowing boat and cutting the rope. Wood chips and lead are flying everywhere around him as O'Donnell's unloads his weapons at him. He aims and fires his final shot.<br/><br/>He misses.<br/><br/>O'Donnell's last shot doesn't, drilling him through the head. Pryce collapses to the deck with a crowd of onlookers watching in horror. His gun clatters to the deck and slides to the feet of a small boy. The boy picks up the gun.<br/><br/>And right at this point, a bloodied, disfigured form appears from the darkness, leaping from the back of the boat, aiming right for O'Donnell. In his teeth is clutched a straight razor. It has to be said, Myles won this conflict pretty convincingly. Eart slashes at O'Donnell's face and head with the razor, splattering blood all over the white nightdress of Boyd. <br/><br/>We have the view from the back of the steamer at the row boat, with Eart still standing, slashing at O'Donnell and everything fades into blackness.<br/><br/>So we had one character reach The End and another completely succumb to his devil, taking vengeance in the most violent and bloody way.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed Dust Devils. It's the game that made me enthusiastic about gaming again after many years of simply not playing or being dispirited by the games I did play in. You really should get it before it's gone.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Torquemada" title="Torquemada"><img alt="Torquemada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Torquemada">Torquemada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171252/#Comment_171252" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T11:33:55+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 11:33AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
