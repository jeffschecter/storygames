Each PC has an enemy, life a goal and a relationship with the Femme Fatale.  Each player has a hand of 7 cards they use to resolve conflicts.  The resolution process is pretty much a simple I play a card, you play a card of higher value, back-forth kind of thing but there's some subtleties.  The real magic is in the face cards which instantly end conflicts by having either the Police (Jacks), The Femme Fatale (Queens) or An Enemy (Kings) show up and intervene in specific ways.<br/><br/>When all the players are out of cards a round of play is over and the GM secretly decides where this is the final round of play or not.  Note: This isn't a big deal.  Most of my One Can Have Her games are over after the first round.  At MOST I've gone one additional round because there was some loose ends that needed exploring.<br/><br/>Anyway, at the end of a round players choose whether they're going to "rat out" any PC to either the Police or their Enemy.  If this really is the final round then any PC ratted out to the police is either killed or imprisoned as their final ending.  If ONLY ONE PC is not ratted out then his character achieves his life goal and gets to determine the final fate of the Femme Fatal (hence the title of the game).  If more than one PC is not ratted out than those PCs are not imprisoned or killed but they don't get their life goal either and the GM decides the fate of the Femme Fatale.<br/><br/>If it isn't the final round of play then those who were not ratted out are dealt 3 more cards and those who were are dealt 1 card and play continues for another short round and then the ratting process is done again and so on until the GM decides to end the game.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331479/#Comment_331479" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T11:21:36+00:00" title="June 24, 2011 11:21AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2011 11:22AM by Jesse.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

I generally recommend that people start with the Novella, which will run about 4-6 hours of play. Even at the longest setting, a given story will terminate after three sessions or so.<br/><br/>Also, I found those Actual People, Actual Play links:<br/><br/><a href="http://apap.libsyn.com/episode-25-dirty-secrets-with-porn-stars" rel="nofollow">With Porn Stars</a><br/><a href="http://apap.libsyn.com/episode-26-dirty-secrets-a-murder-of-titanic-proportions-" rel="nofollow">A Murder of Titanic Proportions</a><br/><a href="http://apap.libsyn.com/episode-27-dirty-secrets-round-one-fight-" rel="nofollow">Round One Fight!</a><br/><a href="http://apap.libsyn.com/episode-28-dirty-secrets-the-big-confidential-falcon" rel="nofollow">The Big Confidential Falcon</a><br/><br/>I'd say that this series of podcasts is probably the definitive critical work on <i>Dirty Secrets</i> so far.

That's what we did.  We played all three types of stories back to back with the same investigator.  It was neat.</blockquote>\nA novella is a little too long for all but the most insanely huge single sessions (assuming people haven't played before).  I would say a novella is 2 solid sessions of 3 hours each and a novel is 3-4 (I think, I haven't ever actually played a novel.)<br/><br/>I think the novella is a little more fun for new people than the short story, because there's a little more crime to go around, which helps keep everyone from constantly running circles around each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331550/#Comment_331550" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T00:24:33+00:00" title="June 25, 2011 12:24AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2011 12:24AM by Jesse.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I would say a novella is 2 solid sessions of 3 hours each</blockquote>\nHuh.
