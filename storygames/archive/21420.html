Right now what I\u2019ve got is raw and not clear enough.<br/><br/>Plan\u2014devising and preparing for an expedition. This includes; information gathering, procuring provisions, recruiting hirelings, and brokering deals.  It is the crucial element that determines whether a party lives or dies, and ultimately how well it succeeds.<br/><br/>Ruck\u2014shouldering backpacks (which is always loaded down with gear) through cities, wilderness, and dungeons. Rucking requires conditioning, endurance, and character. Is used to cover sustained actions. Running, swimming, climbing, digging, marching, carrying heavy things\u2014anything where your progress is primarily dependent on your endurance. [Mental toughness as well?]<br/><br/>Explore\u2014Lets you determine slopes and directions in enclosed spaces, the ability to detect secret doors, traps and hazards as well as allowing you to measure or estimate distances accurately. It also covers botany and mineral identification (especially when underground).<br/><br/>Camp\u2014covers foraging, finding and building a shelter, and related survival tasks while in the wilderness. It is critical knowledge of navigation and natural sciences (such as botany, ecology, geology, etc\u2026)<br/><br/>Improvise\u2014measures creativity, resourcefulness, and quick-thinking. Also scavenging and crafting materials into something useful in a matter of minutes. The ability to have clever solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems\u200d\u2014\u200coften in life-or-death situations.<br/><br/>Snipe\u2014is moving quietly to evade or avoid confrontation, scouting ahead or spying on enemies, and for surprise. Finesse performing certain tasks, especially with the hands. Can be useful in unscrupulous ways for certain individuals.<br/><br/>Exert\u2014covers sudden bursts of power, throwing things, and breaking stuff. Any task prioritising muscular force over endurance. Also in acts of duress, intimidation, and coercion. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468790/#Comment_468790" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-10T01:18:37+00:00" title="January 10, 2018  1:18AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A very interesting set of 7!

Basically, these seven cover what you need to hex-crawl and dungeon delve. Combat is separate. You\u2019ve got a background that, in certain situations, can compliment a skill. Your background also gives you some special abilities.<br/><br/>For instance, in the game anybody can hide. Hiding is an all or nothing thing. Either you're hidden or you're in view.<br/><br/>Someone with a thief background, however, has a chance to hide in shadows. A thief generally prefers to hide rather than to hide in shadows. It's nice to have a chance to hide in shadows when you need it, though.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" title="FriendlyAlienLocust"><img alt="FriendlyAlienLocust" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468853/#Comment_468853" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-12T01:16:42+00:00" title="January 12, 2018  1:16AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/vgunn" rel="nofollow">vgunn</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For instance, in the game anybody can hide. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hiding is an all or nothing thing.

It's nice to have a chance to hide in shadows when you need it, though.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI think that might be a bad idea, for the reason underlined.<br/><br/>One of the more common buzzterms in stealth gameplay design is <a href="http://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2015/07/the-systemic-failure-of-stealth-games.html" rel="nofollow">partial failure margin</a>. Or, in the words of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI93toQWzr8&amp;t=11m5s" rel="nofollow">a particularly spoony internet personality</a>:\n<blockquote>If you get caught, you're fucked. I repeat: if you're the rogue, and you get caught, you are fucked. <i>You're fucked. <b>You're. Fucked.</b></i> You ever play Hitman and you get caught? Right? You ever see those videos of that guy playing Hitman and he gets caught and he sucks? You're fucked.</blockquote>\nI'm butchering a complicated design theory, but the short version: tension comes from <i>almost</i> failing. The closer you are to the edge, the more interesting the game becomes. Think of the time when you're on your last hit point, but you're already deep into a dungeon and there's no turning back. That's the partial failure margin.<br/><br/>You know your game better than me, and I might be overstepping my bounds by bringing this up, so I'm just gonna leave a couple tricks to extend the margin:<br/><br/><b>1. Reaction time.</b> That is; if you get spotted, you have a chance to react. A guard sees the player, the player shoots the guard in the head before the alarm's raised. We don't want to lock this behind classes, so maybe every player is guaranteed a chance to react, but the thief gains a bonus.<br/><br/><b>2. States of alert.</b> Or rather, when you get spotted, no-quarter combat doesn't immediately start. Keeping with the Hitman theme: in Hitman (2016), there's a boatload of non-combat states clearly given on screen. You can be Suspicious, you can be Found Trespassing, you can be Hunted; tons of situations that aren't 100% hidden, but not 100% revealed. Your disguise might be compromised, the guards might know someone's in the building, but they don't know where. You've been set back, but it you can still salvage the situation if you put in the effort.<br/><br/>For the tabletop, you could judge a "near miss" as tipping off someone to investigate. Or your improvise skill can be used to partially mitigate an alarm; ask the guard where the bathroom is, offer the monster some food, that kind of stuff. Maybe the guard thinks you're just lost. Maybe the monster just wants a friend. Who knows!<br/><br/><b>3. Extra chances.</b> Normally, this would come from spare lives, but you could achieve something similar with a luck system. You have a set amount of luck points, depending on your skills. Each time you're seen, you can use a luck point to reroll. When your luck runs out, you risk getting caught. Very game-y, but it's definitely dramatic.<br/><br/>Just stuff off the top of my head. All these are significant bonuses to the player, so keep that in mind when determining difficulty. Again, you know your system better than me. If you're going rules-lite, then this added complexity might slow the game down. Or the game-ness might somehow compromise your narrative.<br/><br/>Just something to keep in mind. I just spent way too much time on this, so I'll come back later before tackling those skill descriptions. Looking forward to your game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468855/#Comment_468855" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-12T04:53:03+00:00" title="January 12, 2018  4:53AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">@FriendlyAlienLocust</a> <br/><br/>Thanks for the comment!

I'm gonna try and restate the skill descriptions, and we'll see how close I get. If I get close, good. If I miss the mark, then something's being lost in translation.<br/><br/><i><b>Plan:</b> Prep work. Covers intelligence gathering, logistics, contract negotiation, bartering, and the like. The better your Plan, the better your situation when you depart.<br/><br/><b>Ruck:</b> Carrying gear and loot. Covers running, swimming, climbing, hauling, and the like. The better your Ruck, the more you can reasonably carry.<br/><br/><b>Explore:</b> Field cartography skills. Covers navigating, distances and slope estimation, hidden traps and passage discovery, valuable plants and minerals identification, and the like. The better your Explore, the better your odds of recognizing dangers and natural treasures.<br/><br/><b>Camp:</b> Survival skills. Covers shelter building, foraging, kindling, first aid, mindset, and the like. The better your Camp, the better your ability to cope with nature.<br/><br/><b>Improvise:</b> Quick wit. Covers reflexes, processing speed, snap decision making, jury rigging, field crafting, and the like. The better your Improvise, the better you can cope when everything goes wrong.<br/><br/><b>Snipe:</b> Sneaking and spy skills. Covers hiding, moving quietly, physical dexterity, tailing marks, eavesdropping, and the like. The better your Snipe, the better your odds at remaining undetected.<br/><br/><b>Exert:</b> Feats of raw strength. Covers heavy lifting, bashing through doors and barricades, throwing, breaking things, and the like. The better your Exert, the more force you can put on objects.</i><br/><br/>In writing these, I tried to keep the list as formulaic as possible. Single sentence summary, then a list of examples in <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses" rel="nofollow">progressive tense</a>, then the skill's overall benefit. The idea is the similar structure makes it easier to parse; the brain doesn't need to decipher grammar, so it can focus on the content. However, formulaic writing could bore the reader, which would cause them to start skimming. There's probably a middle ground somewhere.<br/><br/>The only thing that confuses me is Snipe. From the name, I assumed it means "sniper skills", but that more accurately describes Explore. Snipe seems more like "guerilla skills"; ambushes, sabotage, that kind of thing. Explore includes gauging distances and finding hidden objects, which would help with ranging weapons and spotting targets, respectively.<br/><br/>This skill set genuinely interests me. I like how everything's focused on wilderness expeditions, and how each seems important. They're pretty well distinguished, too; if I pick two skills at random, I can see a personality framework. The Ruck and Exert specialist is the big guy that relies solely on strength, the Plan and Explore specialist is the Lewis &amp; Clark style explorer, the Camp and Improvise specialist is the highly adaptable survivalist, the Snipe and Improvise specialist is the highly trained scout, and so on. It triggers the part in me that likes creating characters.

I think the <i>names</i> are the weak point here.

While I do think the descriptions could use a bit of tidying up for crystal clarity, I think the names need a rethink. While I was able to get past most of them, they were a pretty large stumbling block while parsing the descriptions. For instance, without reading the description, does charting a route fall under Plan or Explore? If you need a chart a new route halfway through an expedition, would that be Improvise? I'm still not sure what Snipe is; the name and descriptions seem to indicate two different things.<br/><br/>Assuming the descriptions are accurate, here's my quick recommendations:<br/><br/><b>Plan -&gt; Prep<br/>Ruck -&gt; Fitness/Carry</b> (depending on how its used in the rules. If it's primarily used to increase encumbrance limit, reduce encumbrance penalties, etc., then Carry. Otherwise, Endurance)<br/><b>Explore -&gt; Survey<br/>Camp -&gt; Survive<br/>Improvise -&gt; Improvise<br/>Snipe -&gt; Spy/Scout</b> (depending on expected usage/game theming)<br/><b>Exert -&gt; Strength</b><br/><br/>These are all off the top of my head; they could probably be polished by looking at a thesaurus. Instead of switching between verbs and adjectives like I did, you could make them all verbs of consistent tense, or make them all adjectives. Don't want to write your game for you.<br/><br/>Also, I realize I'm being super-duper grammah nazi, but it really matters. If there is any ambiguity to your mechanics, especially the core mechanics, then someone will miss the bell. At best, different groups will play with ever-so-slightly different rules, which could potentially lead to confusion when players change groups. At worst, players will deliberately exploit your wording to give their characters power.

And, since it's not a word with its own meaning, I *have* to find out, and, once I do, it has the meaning the designer intended, and only that meaning, instead of other connotations.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468878/#Comment_468878" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-13T03:58:54+00:00" title="January 13, 2018  3:58AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">@FriendlyAlienLocust</a> Excellent write up, thank you so much.

While I do think the descriptions could use a bit of tidying up for crystal clarity, I think the names need a rethink. While I was able to get past most of them, they were a pretty large stumbling block while parsing the descriptions. For instance, without reading the description, does charting a route fall under Plan or Explore? If you need a chart a new route halfway through an expedition, would that be Improvise? I'm still not sure what Snipe is; the name and descriptions seem to indicate two different things.<br/><br/>Assuming the descriptions are accurate, here's my quick recommendations:<br/><br/><b>Plan -&gt; Prep<br/>Ruck -&gt; Fitness/Carry</b> (depending on how its used in the rules. If it's primarily used to increase encumbrance limit, reduce encumbrance penalties, etc., then Carry. Otherwise, Endurance)<br/><b>Explore -&gt; Survey<br/>Camp -&gt; Survive<br/>Improvise -&gt; Improvise<br/>Snipe -&gt; Spy/Scout</b> (depending on expected usage/game theming)<br/><b>Exert -&gt; Strength</b><br/><br/>These are all off the top of my head; they could probably be polished by looking at a thesaurus. Instead of switching between verbs and adjectives like I did, you could make them all verbs of consistent tense, or make them all adjectives. Don't want to write your game for you.<br/><br/>Also, I realize I'm being super-duper grammah nazi, but it really matters. If there is any ambiguity to your mechanics, especially the core mechanics, then someone will miss the bell. At best, different groups will play with ever-so-slightly different rules, which could potentially lead to confusion when players change groups. At worst, players will deliberately exploit your wording to give their characters power. Because people are mean <img alt=":disappointed:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/disappointed.png" title=":disappointed:"/> <small>No one wants to be friends with an alien locust</small></div></blockquote>\nWhat I don\u2019t want are bog-standard names. But also they need to be easily groked. So fitness, survive, and Strength are out. Plus you can also have a number of skills starting with S. Prep or Prepare are fine alternatives to Plan. Sneak I like instead of Snipe, though Scout has a nice flavor to it with: Camp, Ruck, Explore, and Improvise. Gives a Boy Scout, merit badge vibe and that\u2019s what I want.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468882/#Comment_468882" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-13T04:25:36+00:00" title="January 13, 2018  4:25AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On that note, Prepare works as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468885/#Comment_468885" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-13T04:46:33+00:00" title="January 13, 2018  4:46AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prepare, Camp, Ruck, Explore, Improvise, Craft, Heave?<br/><br/>Exert sounds a little colder to me than the others, more scientific or formal or something.
