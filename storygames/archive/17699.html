While half the kids hopped on the computers to play some Math games, the other four sat around my table and we played out an awesome session of freeform story gaming. <br/><br/>I used <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pJKDnBe6J5Q/UI13kTAEbHI/AAAAAAAADPA/ySYzravZoVU/s1600/rcg.jpg" rel="nofollow">this table</a> to establish our genre.<br/><br/>Each kid wrote down three skills their character would be good at on an index card and their character's name.<br/><br/>For conflict resolution, if you were using a skill you rolled a d6 and had to roll 3 or higher to succeed.<br/><br/>For everything else we used the following table:<br/>1-No and<br/>2-No<br/>3-No But<br/>4-Yes But<br/>5- Yes<br/>6-Yes And<br/><br/>The result was a game where every single person was deeply engaged. The summary is as follows:<br/><br/>In an Alternate Modern world where dinosaurs still roam and Harry Potter-esque wizards and witches are commonplace, the Dark Diamond is stolen from the home of Rebecca. The Diamond contains the soul of a dark wizard who must not be released. While CIA agent Tom Harperson searches for the thief, Rebecca and her two friends, Kristiana and Kimberly, search the local mall for the thief. They finally find him and, using her illusion spell, Rebecca pretends to be the thief's mother. He sees through her ruse and makes a run for it. Agent Tom drives over to the mall in his secret agent truck but is attacked by a T-Rex. Back at the mall, Kimberly blasts the thief with a fire spell that simply singes his backside. Agent Tom shows up and fires a warning shot to scare the thief, but instead draws the attention of some circling Pterodactyls who carry Tom off. Kristiana uses her flying spell to try and land on the thief's getaway vehicle but hits the pavement. Finally, Rebecca succeeds in tricking the thief by using her illusion spell to make herself appear as a beautiful woman. The thief is distracted and drops the diamond, and the heroes save the day just in time.<br/><br/>The kids kept jumping out of their seats with every dice roll, cheering like crazy every time a six came up. Was a lot of fun for myself and them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400902/#Comment_400902" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T20:12:50+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  8:12PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2012 8:13PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!<br/><br/>How did you decide when to roll the die?<br/><br/>Did you play a traditional GM role, or was there more free-wheeling than that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400911/#Comment_400911" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T23:02:37+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 11:02PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The kids kept jumping out of their seats with every dice roll, cheering like crazy every time a six came up.

For example, one girl said she wanted to check the mall for the thief so we rolled using the table of responses. <br/><br/>As a GM, I was more free-wheeling, picking moments where I would roll for a random event to occur. I used the dinosaurs as a random factor, so after every round of turns, I rolled and if I hit a 1 a dinosaur would appear. Otherwise, I asked a lot of questions about the world and what was happening so that the players ended up generating most of what happened. I was more of a facilitator than a director.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400927/#Comment_400927" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-15T07:36:10+00:00" title="December 15, 2012  7:36AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
