As far as I know, he coined the term in this context. The term and his discussion of it rang so true with me that I applied it to my efforts (with Willem's permission) and have spread the term around quite a bit now.<br/><br/>I did some research and also discovered that some sort of (Disney-affiliated?) company was using the term several years ago. They may now be defunct. They're at www.storyjam.com, but fyi my security software warns me that their site is a little sketchy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223814/#Comment_223814" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T18:25:29+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  6:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Willem and Julian are the ones I've heard the term from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223825/#Comment_223825" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T18:55:04+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  6:55PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>that sounds like some kind of fibrous preserve.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223840/#Comment_223840" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T20:26:59+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  8:26PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>that sounds like some kind of fibrous preserve.</blockquote>\nWhen the text is all written, layed out, books printed up, you should sell it with a jar of homemade jam, Julian!

I, too, first heard it from Willem, when we got started discussing how story games might achieve the things we want to do with them. I loved the musical imagery involved. For me (and while I can't speak for Willem, I think he agrees), "storyjamming" brings with it a real focus on what I think Ron Edwards meant by the "shared imagined space." We want to share the same dream, as much as we can. Like in a good jam session, you don't have a set script or plan, but by playing together, your rhythm synchronizes, you harmonize, you start playing the same song, even if it turns out as a song no one ever wrote or played before. Likewise, storyjamming aims to have us all see and imagine the same thing, telling the same story, even when we end up with a story no one's ever told before.<br/><br/>So, actually, something like that, Blue, when you do it really well. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>More recently, I've heard some other folks use it, which made me happy. But I also heard people use it to simply mean, "playing story games," without that added dimension, and that made me sad. Most recently, I saw it in your thread, Antiquitus, and you using it to mean playing a specific game, and that really stuck in my craw.<br/><br/>If "storyjamming" ends up becoming vacuous and meaningless because it gets misused so routinely that nobody even knows that it once referred to something specific, we'll just have to find some other term to define what we do\u2014even if it seems unlikely that we might find one as good as that. But I'd hate for that to happen. While I very much appreciate people picking up the term, I hope you'll also recognize that it describes a very specific style of play, and a very specific goal to get out of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224085/#Comment_224085" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T14:46:51+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  2:46PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2009 2:47PM by Antiquitus.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>I agree that it describes a certain kind of play. I can also understand your investment in the term. I, too, am invested in the term, and would feel frustrated if I thought I saw it being diluted or misused.<br/><br/>My efforts at designing a Story Jam method (with encouragement from Willem) emerged when I discovered that variations on the Story Jam kind of play was very much what I wanted from my game experience.  Indeed, in a way, I am trying to nail down what it is that I love about this kind of play so that others can enjoy it, too. It would be difficult to describe what I'm doing with Story Jam as a "game". If you'd like to learn something about what I'm working on and then contribute your own ideas of what would make it more closely aligned with "Story Jam" as a concept, please feel free to ask me for a draft. I more than welcome others' involvement, ideas, and opinions.<br/><br/>You may be interested to know that Story Jam is not that new of a term, but has been circulating for awhile in different contexts. Willem thought it up himself, poetically, as did other people in their own corners of the world.

I know Willem came to the term independent of story games. He used it to describe something he was already doing before he found story games. Something that grew from story telling, not from game playing. So it has a distinct evolution. More importantly, it's not a term meant for THIS community. Willem (and many of us in Portland) use storyjamming to describe what we do to people who don't know about or play/use any kind of story game or rpg.  By extension, there are now a lot of people in Portland who storyjam now, that have had never role played or story games before.<br/><br/>I'm starting to use the term (and the related term story engine) to describe my more recent projects that I don't consider games.

Storyjamming. For those (like Jake) who have said so, I agree: I use it to explain what I want to accomplish together with new folks. It never fails to make a light bulb switch on above their heads. <br/><br/>I agree that storyjamming differs fundamentally from a certain class of rpgs/story games in its intention. An overlap definitely exists, but it has made my play better to make the distinction. Jason's comment about discovery (rather than "creating") hits a big chunk. If this seems like picking nits or overly philosophical, you might listen to Elizabeth Gilbert's take (as just one voice on why this makes a big difference): <br/><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius.html</a><br/><br/>Also the goal of group "harmonizing" really nails it. In so many discussions about role-playing games/story games, I hear the presuppostion "that you will always have some people who will want to break the game, or just be an asshole, and you need rules to prevent it". Whereas for me jamming implies that we've all chosen to play together because we share the intention of playing in harmony - quite literally. We don't play unless we have this. And because we have this, we can do things that we couldn't accomplish otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224315/#Comment_224315" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T13:35:03+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  1:35PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2009 1:51PM by Antiquitus.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite><br/><br/>But... that what words<i>do</i>.

If we get cute about "bread and jam" and such, that dilutes its power. For instance, Jake, I was aware you were using "story engine," but I hadn't known you had adopted "storyjamming."

Jamming is a term used to describe all kinds of artistic collaboration (although I do suspect it originates from music). Cartoon Jamming was something I grew up with in comic clubs and communities. So when I hear Jamming I think of collaboration. I can see why it clicked that way for you, especially in relation to Ron's term. I'm not a music guy so I don't think that way. <br/><br/>In any case, I see Storyjamming as the action. The Story Engine is the tool. You don't NEED a tool to Story Jam, but if you have one, it's the Engine.<br/><b><br/>Clarification of purpose</b>: I'm not trying to convince anyone else to use Storyjamming as a term, and I came up with Story Engine for my own purposes. So I'm not looking to have that term accepted or ratified either. I just  find that both terms are very convenient for describing most of the storytelling (and some of the game) experiences that I've been creating and enjoying for the last year or two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224345/#Comment_224345" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T14:54:50+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  2:54PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jake: Yep, it originates in music (i.e. "Jam Session.") I expect you first encountered it in the comics field, where "Art jams" are something of a trend, no?<br/><br/>In any case, I still feel that "jam" in the sense of an artistic collaboration doesn't mesh well with "engine" in the sense of mechanism. Like you said, you're not trying to codify anything for anyone, so how you use the terms is your deal. I'm just saying that you saying "story engine" did not in <i>any way</i> tell me that you had adopted the culture of "Storyjamming," or to see any relation between the concepts. I just found out in this thread that the two are related for you. Just something to keep in mind is all.<br/><br/>I think the topic is getting more than a bit sticky (perhaps even <i>touchy</i>. . .?) because of the different people (at least 5, if you include me) using "story jam" and maybe not all meaning the same thing by it. As Nick says, that's the way the language cookie crumbles, but at the same time I wonder if there's anything we can do to improve clarity? (I'm trying, by for instance asking Willem questions. Maybe that's the answer: we each tell our own story, and ask others for clarification on theirs.)<br/><br/>Julian, at this point I'm the most befuddled by your usage, because it seems like your methods might be subtly but significantly divergent from Willem's and/or Jason's.

It's getting confusing and I keep jumping up to see if the inestimable Mister Corley has entered the discourse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224347/#Comment_224347" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T15:19:51+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  3:19PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2009 3:21PM by Antiquitus.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel that this atmosphere is no longer conducive for me to actually communicate on this subject, so I am withdrawing from the thread.<br/><br/>Such is the way of forums, of course, but for folks who want to engage with me about Story Jam in a real way, I encourage your private messages!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224357/#Comment_224357" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T15:52:46+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  3:52PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joel: Because I don't know Julian, and I saw someone refer to him as "JD," so I thought that was his name. Sorry! As for flow, I've spent some time exploring the relationship between storyjamming and flow. I think they have a lot in common, but I don't know if I'd <em>define</em> it that way.<br/><br/>Julian: I don't know what difference it makes to what degree you've designed your game for the story games community. As Jake pointed out, the general term "storyjamming" didn't develop inside that community, either. I agree, you need an easily communicated word. I think I'd feel more comfortable if you had a name for it, and described it as a system for storyjamming. For instance, I've spent some time working on a game called <em>The Fifth World</em>, a set of rules for storyjamming. By which I mean a particular style and kind of play, not a module, add-on, extension, or anything else attached to <em>your</em> game.<br/><br/>You have no obligation to make me feel comfortable about your game's name, though. I do wonder, though,  if your last post doesn't illustrate something of the problem? I asked about the term in general, and so far as I can tell, we still have a discussion going about that term. Your last post, to me, seems to imply that you consider <em>your game</em> the subject. Have I misinterpreted?<br/><br/>Simon: Depending on the people and the game, if you looked at a table from the outside, you might not tell the difference between a group storyjamming and a group playing a story game. They differ in why they engage the activity, and what they hope to get out of it. The criteria for a night well spent differ. I don't know if I would use the term "storyjamming" in the sense of "we could storyjam or we could roleplay." But it definitely does help define the kind of game I want to play, and what I hope to get out of it.<br/><br/>Let me put it another way: if I tell my friends I'd like to roleplay, we could play something I find mind-numbingly boring and I end up having a terrible time at the same activity where lots of others have a great deal of fun. If I tell them I'd like to storyjam (assuming I've defined the term well enough), they come to the table with the same expectations, and we all have a good time. I consider that result well worth the term's existence.<br/><br/>Which also helps explain why I feel uncomfortable with the name of Julian's game: I don't necessarily want my friends to think I mean playing that particular game, either.<br/><br/>Nick: Of course, though not all words eventually degrade to meaninglessness. I'd rather see "storyjamming" retain its meaning, because otherwise, I really have no word to describe what I do!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224388/#Comment_224388" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T20:02:11+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  8:02PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that Storyjamming is quite close to the technique of Ideafarming, although the latter breaks things down into different story seeds.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224404/#Comment_224404" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T21:58:22+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  9:58PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2009 9:27AM by ccreitz.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Story jam is frequently made by scene farmers, in seasons of abundance.</blockquote><a href="http://robin-d-laws.livejournal.com/366877.html" rel="nofollow">I believe you earn half a point.</a>Since my use comes from an awesomely fortuitous typo for "scene framing," and in ignorance of Robin's memewar campaign, can I get a "super-non-ironic use" bonus of some kind?

I found on reflection that I disagree strongly with him on one point, that story jamming doesn't result in the creation of a system, in the broad Lumpley sense. Indeed, organically arriving at a system to harmonize the contributions of the participants seems to be vital part of jamming, in stories just as in music. I think it's more helpful to characterize the difference between the two as the relative importance of the products \u2014 that it's a matter of fine degrees, not of kind. That said, the expectation is that if we're jamming, we'll arrive at a place where "Yes, and..." and "Or was it?" might be all we need, because, well, mostly when we think of "jamming" in a musical context, we think of something very loosely structured, Phish or whatever. (I've collaboratively improvised in more structured environments, music and stories, and I don't have a problem calling that jamming either, but I understand that the connotation runs toward fewer constraints.)<br/><br/>Julian's system is very loose, practically just a collection of techniques. I feel like agreeing to it wouldn't preclude storyjamming in what  take to be Jason's (and Willem's, I guess) sense.  But nor is it the only way, or in some sense the "always best" or "most inclusive" way, to do so \u2014 I don't imagine Julian would claim it is.  So when I posted, I was trying to say something like this. It's a little imprecise for Julian to call the system "Story Jam," but it would be much worse for him to call it "One Way You Might Story Jam If Everyone Agrees" because that's a terrible name in general. What a pickle! (...jam, pickle, preserved food, get it?)  <br/><br/>In any case, getting into a territorial dispute is silly. Already, I hate that "Story Now", which seems like a helpful and concise description of what I love about a really great gaming session ("right there at the table, not in the GM's prep, not in the postmortem, but bam! viva voce!"), has taken on this ponderous and unfun political weight that makes it distasteful. It's in the spirit of "jamming" to be inclusive. Lots of people have already seen and used the "story jamming" metaphor. Why make an issue out of this use?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224410/#Comment_224410" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T23:26:59+00:00" title="August 12, 2009 11:26PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I honestly think the key to any of these terms is to allow them to be descriptive and for people to not self-identify with them (frex: "I am a storygamer" is an abomination, unless it refers to people who visit this website).
