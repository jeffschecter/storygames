                    Hey all:<br/><br/>I like the idea of struggling against nature.  Like finding water and shelter and food in the wastes in Dark Sun, or an arctic setting.  However, in all the games I've tried it with (from old school AD&amp;D 2E with the assistance of the 1E Wilderness Survival Guide, to even Sorcerer or the like) it always seemed to come out kind of cold.<br/><br/>It usually devolves to one of the following things:<br/><br/>1) Very simple resource management ("You fail your survival check. Dehydration sets in." Player: "Crap" {checks off one 'water' box}).<br/><br/>2) The GM regaling the group with a narrative of how the environment threatens them, while the players silently listen. Eventually, they overcome. Dice, if rolled at all, influence how easily/hard they overcome the threat.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that there might be something to be done about this. What I'm looking for is a solution where:<br/><br/>0) It can be applied to any regular/trad system<br/>1) The environment presents a challenge to be overcome<br/>2) The players have a say/stake in what happens (to their character, at least): Not just "sit back and listen to the GM tell us the story of the sandstorm"<br/>3) Environmental challenges become interesting, when they happen. Not just "lame filler".<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Well, if nature itself isn't interesting, I find that often what it says about the <i>characters</i> is.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing like discovering that your mousey librarian girl will, when sufficiently hungry, smash a small creature to death with a rock and then rip gobbets of flesh off of it with her bare teeth.  Or, alternatively, that she <i>won't</i>, even when she faints from starvation as a consequence.                        </div>

                            My wife loves disaster flicks.  The best of them often need to make concessions to plausability in order to keep the Drama flowing.<br>One of the techniques in that gets used in many of these films-- even the better ones-- is to impart some unspoken inteligence to the disaster.  Maybe if the crisis/struggle had a certain number of Drama Points to spend to advance the situation?  To use the sandstorm in your example, the victims have one real need: shelter.  If they find it by hiding behind a broken wall and covering with a section of canvas, the storm rips away the canvas at a cost of one Drama Point.  The sandstorm can even behave in seemingly intelegent ways to confound the players by dropping Drama.<br><br/>I've always hated this artifact in film, but it's a technique that gets plenty of use in Hollywoodland to make disasters and the struggle against nature more dramatic.                        </br></br></div>

                            You could just give the environment a number of required success rolls and failure rolls. Then let the players figure out what they'd do to survive there and make rolls. If they hit the number of required success rolls before they hit the number of failed rolls, they survive.<br/><br/>This reminds me of a real survival story that I heard recently. A guy goes out hiking, sets up camp, losses his camp, he find a hollow log, crawls in, and after a week or so, a dog finds him. He gets rescued. Maybe you could break down a typical survival scenario to get some ideas.<br/><br/>This may be way off, but is it really a struggle of man vs nature or a struggle of man vs. his lack of knowledge of how to survive in that nature.                        </div>

                            We've done more or less what Justin is suggesting in a number of our games- nature is played as a character/opponent in conflict with the characters, with resources and motivations of it's own.  <br/><br/>During our viking game, going to sea was always dangerous, because the Sea actively "wanted" to kick the viking's ship to pieces.  Most times we played as if the Sea had an animal intelligence, with very basic wants (it's angry today, and the PCs are in the way).  Sometimes we assumed the gods were behind it, which gave the Sea a more directed motivation ("it's angry at SkjÃ¶ldur because he offended the gods, and it's trying to drown him").                        </div>

                            I think that the reason that kind of thing is so unsatisfying is because it's <i>reactive</i> and uninvolving.  There's no choices made by the players involved, which also means little-to-no investment.<br/><br/>Solutions?  Well, personifying nature within the system and thenrunning it using the game's extended conflict system springs to mind.  But that's going to be easier said than done in some cases..  Hmm.                        </div>

                            Justin:  I rather like the idea of the intelligent disaster.  The thing I wonder about though is how to motivate the person playing the disaster to provide those little lulls that make the conflict ... I don't know what they make it, but ... better.<br/>
<br/>
Like, there's a sandstorm, and people jury-rig a shelter from a broken wall and canvas.  If the wind <b>immediately</b> tears the canvas away then you have an unrelenting, malevolent disaster ... and that's one type of conflict.  But if the characters get a chance to huddle inside their shelter (and to decide whether to take a next step toward fighting the storm (pushing them ever closer to exhaustion) or to try to catch their breath and hopefully marshall some of the internal resources they'll require to ride out the storm) then that's a different kind of conflict.<br/>
<br/>
In what I consider "good" disaster movies, I see those lulls a lot.  The canvas gets ripped away when you've just gotten accustomed to it being there, not necessarily in the moment that you first put it up.  Is that something that's worth systematizing in some way?                        </div>

<p>I'll echo what's already been said here.  Treat nature like a character.  Then use that character to make the player make interesting choices.</p>
<p>I only figured that good stuff out properly this year while running tMW.  Like;  Ok, I want a snowstorm to mess with the ronin.  So what does the snowstorm <em>want</em>?  Well, it wants two things.  First it wants to seperate the ronin into two groups.  Then it wants one group to eat the flesh of a Tengu and it wants the other group to burn a priceless scroll. *</p>
<p>Of course, incorporating that into tMW is super-easy.  The storm gets 1d6 just like any other beast, and then I just decide how 'strong' it is in case any clever ronin get around to realizing that they can attack and destroy the damned thing.  I suppose it would work out as well in d20 D&amp;D if you were to stat the thing up as a "Winter Storm Spirit" or something.</p>
<p>But anyway, once you know what nature wants to the PCs to do everything else really just falls in place.</p>
<p>edit: * You know, I only just came up with that scenario off the top of my head for this thread, but it's so going into my bag of tricks for tMW.</p>

                            I run nature "encounters" as mental challenges.  The GM describes how tough the environment is on the character, and the player counters not only with actions, but moreso by exploring what drives the character forward; what makes her take all that suffering without lying down, what keeps her from turning around, what experiences and connections give her the strength to plow on through?                        </div>

                            I think our modern-day hippiness may be getting in the way, here.  The vast majority of the Man vs Nature conflicts are about man <em>conquering</em> Nature, of imposing his will on the hostile world.  That's not really in vogue now, so we tend to think in terms of man surviving in a hostile world, which is sort of a diluted version of living in harmony with the natural world.  In order for it to be a real conflict, it's got to have two sides: sure, Nature wants something inicimal to Man, but this also <em>requires</em> Man wanting something inicimal to Nature.  Man wants to beat down Nature and make it his bitch.  Man winning means him coming out of the conflict as the victor, not as the survivor, and Nature coming out as the loser, not continuing to do its thing over there but this one guy got through.  Unless you have that element, I don't know if you can really do Man vs Nature.                        </div>

                            For my money, a dramatic situation boils down to choices for the character(s), with hope and fear associated with various choices. Hope for a good outcome, fear of a bad one.<br/><br/>Making the adversary seem intelligent is one way to get that, but it's not necessary, as long as there's some source of information about good and bad outcomes, and a series of gut-wrenching choices that have to be made.<br/><br/>The mousy librarian example is perfect. If she doesn't eat, she might starve. But all she's got to eat is a rat. Nasty! Will she get a disease from that? She's probably afraid she will, whether that's true or not.                        </div>

<p>Joshua,</p>
<p>How is our modern hippie gaming getting in the way of that?  If I play a storm as a character, give it a goal, and you, as a player, prevent that storm from getting it's goals, then haven't you defeated the storm?  Isn't that both Man v. Nature and modern hippie gaming all at the same time?</p>
<p>Also, I tried looking up inicimal in the dictionary and couldn't find it.  What does it mean?</p>

                            Man vs Nature with the storm is not just that Man prevents the storm from getting what it wants, but he disperses the storm or fixes the global atmospheric collapse or whatever.  Man wins, not Man survives.  If you look at, say, Robinson Crusoe, his victory isn't that he survives on the island but that he turns the island into a little pocket of civilization, despite the island's best efforts.<br/><br/>Inicimal is... crap, I'm probably mispelling it or something.  It means "directly at odds with the interests of the other person."  Now I'm going to have to track the damn etymology down.                        </div>

                            Couple of things spring to mind, I have worked on this on and off for some time:<br/><br/>1) A survival mini-game, like Spycraft's chase mini-game or D20's combat mini-game.  This survival mini-game would break down survival resources like shelter, food, water, temperature (heat in the cold, cold in the heat) and players would prioritize them over a period of time using various strategies.  Your survival skill would affect both how well you used the strategies you picked and how you could "multitask" (much like how the D20 combat mini-game tells you how well you perform each attack and how you can perform multiple attacks.)  The environmental danger depletes those resources in a way that's not visible to the players, although again, skills can give them some idea of what to expect.  When a resource runs low or runs out, that's when the character really starts to get in trouble.<br/><br/>You could incorporate either the living-in-harmony or conquering-nature in the strategies and equipment you selected.<br/><br/>2) Man vs. Nature is also the battle in an exploration game, although there's also the element of the unknown. Basically the exploration mini-game is "how far can we go on the resources we have", there's the safe strategy of turning back when you're less than half-consumed your resources, there's riskier strategies of counting on hunting or trading with natives in order to continue onwards, and there's choices about whether to press on to the next outpost or go back. The Oregon Trail computer game has tilled this ground so well there's really not much I can add to it.  Go play it here if you forgot what it was like: <a href="http://www.virtualapple.org/oregontraildisk.html" rel="nofollow">Oregon Trail at virtualapple.</a> </div>

Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how personifying nature inherently adds any player choices.  If it's still just a straight-up conflict of one against the other, then it still comes down to a dice-off.  <br/><br/>Adding choices would be things like trying the quicker route which has associated risks, or the slower route where your food and water supply might run out.  I also agree that a goal besides survival is important.  I just read <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Black Powder War</span> where the protagonists were travelling across Central Asia, and they had to decide several times about whether the risks they were taking were appropriate to the mission they were sent on.  Also, it can be interesting for different characters to be threatened differently.  i.e. If Percival is the one who will starve first, how does that effect all the <i>other</i> character's decisions.  <br/><br/>Nature can have <i>character</i> without being personified as an intelligent force.  Good travel writing brings across the feel of a land -- the ways that it is deceptive, the hidden treasures, and so forth.                        </div>

Good god, Fred, have you ever BEEN in a cave? Deathtraps. Especially without modern materials and electric lamps. There are a lot of horrible ways to die underground that have nothing to do with monsters.                        </div>

Well, to be clear, by "personify within the system" I basically meant "stat it up as a character".<br/><br/>See I'm assuming that the game in question already has plenty of opportunity for interest and player choice built into its main conflict system (probably combat), since most traditional games <i>do</i>.  The point is to redefinine the "vs nature" into something that properly slots into it, so you can use all the strengths and detail of that same familiar system.<br/><br/>Say for Storyteller (or whatever) you could give it metaphorical attacks to represent what it throws at the players, and health levels to represent the duration or extent of the experience.  Then play pick and mix with how character abilities are applicable - maybe a "freezing cold at night" metaphorical attack can be dodged with a good survival (making tents) roll.  Or whatever seems appropriate to the situation.  And the desert's health levels would be "distance to destination", with the characters' "attacks" being them pressing onward, rolling skills applicable to the terrain.  And there's all the usual resource management like deciding whether and when to spend willpower, or activating cool powers and so forth.<br/><br/>Actually, storyteller's a really awkward fit because of all the variables (hence the easier said than done bit).  It'd be easier in something more abstract like heroquest.  But that's the idea anyway.                        </div>

                            Great suggestions, all. I particularly like personifying the "Nature" as an entity. Specific comments:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>A survival mini-game, like Spycraft's chase mini-game or D20's combat mini-game.</blockquote>
ROCK.  Dammit, I wanted to wait for Spycraft 2.0 until the revised version came out (with the errata fixed), but every day breaks me down a little. Might have to either just break down and buy the Revised PDF, or get the 2.0 Corebook from the LGS and apply the Errata...
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how personifying nature inherently adds any player choices.</blockquote>
Hmmm.  Good point.<br/><br/>After thinking about it for a bit (and please everyone, continue on the tangents appearing in this thread, y'all don't have to focus on "Andy's Problem" or anything like that, I just wanted to revise my original post), the Epitome of the situation I was looking to solve was this:<br/><br/>DARK SUN. The AD&amp;D 2e campaign world of psychic cannibal halfling gladiators, corrupt sorcerer-kings, life-draining magic and sandy wastes straight outta Just About Every Post-Apoc Movie You've Ever Seen.<br/><br/>The game emphasizes that travel between locales is dangerous, and the PCs can be set upon by perils in the form of environmental hazards; namely dehydration, weather events, monsters, etc. You can almost see the perils of a small party facing a mile-high Dune-scale sandstorm, or wading into the forlorn Sea of Silt, or climbing the scorched Cliffs of Whatever to quickly get to the McGuffin.<br/><br/>(oh, side tangent: Breaking down environmental risks into rolls; then enhancing the tension by adding a time limit: "You must cross this sandy waste in record time or you won't save the Elven Poisoner" etc. OK, back to the post)<br/><br/>Anyway, that's the kind of things that the Dark Sun boxed set sets you up for. But in practice, all Non-Dehydration environmental dangers involve nothing more than running into monsters in the wilderness.  The Dark Sun Monster Compendiums are filled with cool shit that's out to kill you: sand crustaceans with poisonous barbs, carniverous cacti, oasis-demons that you drink then they kill you from the inside; random rampaging beasts; etc.<br/><br/>I remember even thinking back in high school, "is there more to it than just fighting shit in the sand?" I couldn't find a better way to handle environmental dangers, so most of my Dark Sun campaigns (which I played, and ran, the hell out of) took place primarily in the city-states, handwaving the travel between them.<br/><br/>So that's what I meant to address in my own posts in this thread. I see lots of cool ideas to address that sort of thing, like personifying environmental hazards, or using a Spycraft style "chase mechanic", but with "environmental danger mini-game" instead of "chase mini-game", etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Aw crap. JD beat me to it.<br/>
<br/>
Tony got it first. It's about decisions, as always. John is right that personalizing the thing only helps if that allows you somehow to create these decisions.<br/>
<br/>
This is true across all styles of play, too. For the nar side, it's "Do you eat that rat?" For the gamism side, it's "Which decision leads to the best result?"<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the mini-game idea Jason has as a way to create decisions, there's also using these sorts of conflicts in a larger context. Do I use up resource A now to deal with this disaster, or save it for something I see coming up later that might be worse? Or brave a dangerous natural situation to gain otherwise hidden knowledge that can help me?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there's lots of other ways to engineer this, as many as there are facets to gamism. Nature is just a backdrop to these decision points.<br/>
<br/>
A problem with "disaster" per se is that it often puts survivial up on the block. This is bad because it means you can't fail without the game ending (meaning it might be very short and undramatic), or because the decisions presented often have only one choice. Eventually the librarian will probably eat the rat if she realizes how dire her situation. Rather it's only a question for a select few. You can't present that situation to a character who's like me, because that's no choice at all, I'd eat the rat in a moment if I were hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Basically there are few things as valuable to a character as their life, so finding something to put up on the other side is hard. And if they do choose to risk their life then you either have to bail them out, or allow the character to die.<br/>
<br/>
Consider using the environment to pressurize less direct problems. Uh, the disaster means choosing slight danger if we go left, or insulting a friend. Use resource X, or resource Y, or die (really only a choice between the first two).<br/>
<br/>
Save the actual survival portion for the climax.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>The thing I wonder about though is how to motivate the person playing the disaster to provide those little lulls that make the conflict ... I don't know what they make it, but ... better.</blockquote>
Absolutely.  Again, going back to my beloved's disaster flicks, they are downright uninteresting if there aren't downtimes to pursue the characters non-disaster agendas, &amp;c.  The first solution would be to have this conflict in addition to another goal being pursued.  This comes back to the Disaster is a Villain.  Just like a villain, if he/she/it is only after killing someone in an open field, the villain gets feeble in a hurry.  Likewise, the Sandstorm Villain gets much more interesting if it is complicating the search for the McGuffin.  Cap the Sandstorm Villian at 1 Drama Point/ Action per advance in the McGuffin plot.  This will provide the respite required for full realization of awesome and keep the Sandstorm from blowing it's whole wad up front.<br><br>Part of what made the whole travel in Dark Sun about fighting stuff is that is what D&amp;D is about.  On top of that, the secondary goal being "walk quickly" isn't all that cool.  Give them something else to accomplish while trying to fight off the environmental hazard.                        </br></br></div>

                            I just finished reading "Into Thin Air" by Jon Krakauer, about the (latest-but-one) Everest climbing disaster.  It's been out a while, but here's a spoiler space:<br><br><br>Interesting book, full of awful things happening to nice people.  One of the things I got from the book is that the people who climb Everest, despite the cold and lack of oxygen and falling rocks and stuff, are so focused on reaching the summit that they ignore or push past all the dangers.  Most of the folks who die in Krakauer's book died on the way down from the summit, they'd spent all their safety margin getting to the top.  <br><br>One of the many sad things in the book is one of the leaders who goes against his better judgement to help get his team up the mountain, gets injured at the top and waits for rescue. Krakauer describes the radio conversations where they have to tell him that the weather is gettig worse and that the rescue has been called off, and his fairly gallant response to this death sentence.  <br><br>So where I am going with this: maybe that there is more than one way of approaching a Man vs. Nature challenge -- there's the careful strategy method that J.D. Corley described in the Oregon Trail game, and then there's staking it all on "winning" the challenge, and then skill and luck determine the price you pay.  Both models might be useful for game design, but maybe two very different game designs.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm surprised I'm the only one who thinks that how you model nature depends entirely on the kind of game you're trying to play.  The most solid use I know for really horrible weather is a horror story, because it eliminates (or better still, it balances out the benefits of) the option of running.  I mean, first thing you want to do in a horror piece is explain "why don't we just run away?"  Well, at least a slasher horror type of thing.  You get the idea.  And the cantaloupe sized hailstones outside is a pretty good damned reason why not.  Or the sucking vacuum of deep space.  <br><br>If you're looking for a survivalist piece in a Jack London vein, it seems like even cursory research on your chosen inhospitable environment will generate a list as long as your arm about bad things that'll happen in the cold, or the heat or the sucking vacuum of deep space.  Any scene someone wants to try something in the environment, share the checklist.  Go down it, looking for precautions they overlooked, resources (internal or external) they're  consuming or random mishaps.  If nothing else this simulates the kind of cumbersome extra work that everything becomes in a hostile environment.  Ideally, the checklist work gets done by an audience player, so that the effects occur in the middle of other things going on.<br><br>Or the Mother Nature: level 20 demigod thing.  That can be good too.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Judson:  Your comment on the deep space thing made me realize another aspect of man vs. nature that I find really enjoyable ... the stories that arise out of just <i>one</i> bad break.  You're exploring the surface of mars, and you fall against a rock outcropping, and when you get up you hear a tiny, almost inaudible, thin <i>whistling</i> sound.<br/>
<br/>
That's a wonderful "Oh shit" moment ... precisely <b>because</b> it'll take a full hour for your oxygen to run fatally low, and even spending that <i>entire hour</i> as calmly and efficiently as you can, it's really unlikely that you'll get back to your base.<br/>
<br/>
One bad break.  Just one ... and the rest plays out from there.  Those are the stories that <b>really</b> make me feel the impartial hostility of the environment, and the distance of man-in-nature from his the concerns of his civilized counterparts.                        </div>

and alot of those stories are at their core man vs. self, but i think that's what most of them(stories) boil down to in some way or another.  just watched "The Old Man and The Sea", yes, watched.  i like my books shown to me.  i'm lazy, what can i say?  it's really man vs. nature, with nature mirroring his feelings, and his struggle.  personifing nature.  the outer world is usually just a personification of the inner one.  really it's about  a man, in the beginning who's clearly lacking something, and it turns out that this horrible/beautiful experience(trial), is what was.<br><br>also just watched Dersu Uzala by Kurosawa, the survival element is only there to create tension, to enhance mood, not really to showcase the major plot of the film(getting old sucks, and friendship is powerful).  i think survival films have to be about something more/else.  sure it can just be about survival, but i'm not sure it would be a good story.                        </br></br></div>

<p>Joshua,</p>
<p>Sorry dude, but you're really just wrong here.  I agree that survival doesn't have to be at stake, but man does not have to conquer nature for it to be a man versus nature conflict (or theme).  If Robinson Crusoe lost the conflict with nature and started acting like a monkey and throwing his poo at Friday, it wouldn't have been any less man v. nature.</p>
<p>If nature wants to have a pristine and untouched valley and man wants to build a shopping complex, and then they fight over it, that's man v. nature.  If man wants to win the Heisman Trophy and nature wants man to look like a putz, and they fight over it, then that's man v. nature.</p>
<p>So, inimical?  Yeah.  I totally agree.  They do need to be at odds.  But once again, I ask you; How do hippy games get in the way of that?  It seems to me that the hippie gaming flavour is perfectly suited to setting up nature and man to be at odds.  DitV, tMW, and TSOY all seem perfectly suited to setting up some awesome man v. nature scenarios without even stretching very hard.</p>

                            Eric, I didn't mean our hippy <em>games</em>, I mean the latent hippiness that surrounds and suffuses modern life, and which leads us to shy away from conquering Nature.  We should live in harmony with nature, and have fluffy bunny friends and all.  If Robinson Crusoe lost, yeah, it's still Man vs. Nature, sure.  And it's about how Man could not beat down Nature but was instead beaten down by it.  It's not how Robinson Crusoe couldn't eek by and merely survive.  Man vs. Nature is a fight to the <em>finish</em>, not a fight to the point at which Man gets away.<br><br>I fully agree with you that we have lots of good tools in indie games to model good, solid, visceral Man vs Nature conflicts.  What I'm saying is that you've got to shy away from stakes and whatnot that read, "I survive" or "I make it through the storm" or whatever.  Those work fine for immediate dice-conflicts, but in the larger structure of the game, the PCs need to take on Nature, rather than try to get past Nature without disrupting it too much.  Unless you go there, then the natural effecsts are just a backdrop for the real conflict, which will be one of the other flavors (Man vs Man, Man vs Self, Man vs Society (only in the US)).<br><br/>Not sure where the Heisman Trophy fits in.  How does Nature prevent Man from winning a football award?  Lightning strikes whenever he takes to the field to practice?                        </br></br></br></div>

                            Well, I can think of a few plots about survival -- like <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0106246/" rel="nofollow"><b>Alive</b></a>, which is about a group of soccer players stranded in a plane crash, who end up eating from the dead.  The issue there is the struggle with what they do to survive.  <br/><br/>On a more uplifting note, I recently watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252444/" rel="nofollow"><b>Rabbit Proof Fence</b></a> which was about a group of young girls who walked 1500 miles across the Australian wilderness to get home.  A key issue for them was not being found, since they were being tracked by authorities who wanted to return them to the shelter they were kept at.  But they had to balance the risk of being found with the risk of dying in the wilderness.  <br/><br/>I would tend to condense this into key decision points, but give a bunch of information on the decision -- like choosing to follow the fence versus cutting cross-country, who to contact for help, and stuff like that.                        </div>

Well, the core of my point is that how you portray nature really depends on what you're trying to do with it.  So if "optimal" is "arctic awesome" then yeah, not the best solution.  I'm trying to picture "arctic awesome" though, and in that case I bow to your greater experience.<br/><br/>If you're trying to impress upon them how inhospitable the arctic wastes are, though, it might be, if not optimal, then in the direction of optimal.  I'm actually specifically thinking of the better parts of "Beyond the Mountains of Madness" and of <cite>White Fang.</cite>  Add a dice based resource management system (sort of like ... is it 7th Sea's? ... ammunition rules) so that methodical preparations aren't guaranteed solutions and that might help put the crunch on.                        </div>

                            I read Michael Taussigâ€™s book My Cocaine Museum recently and among a bunch of interesting stuff in it is a chapter on heat. He notes the perplexing â€˜absence of heatâ€™ in films and books set in or about the tropics. Some of the biggest names of the 20th century in his own field, anthropology, agonized about the stultifying heat in their personal journals and letters, but then ignored it in their published field work. And where fictional accounts touch on heat they usually use it as something that spurs character to act- which is the complete opposite of the lassitude and even depression/self loathing that Taussig claims it brings on. <br/><br/>The problem with trying to use this concept of stultifying heat in a game is that it seems negative and a drain on the flow of play- make your abjection roll based on temp + humidity or your character canâ€™t take an action todayâ€¦ unless there is a way that heat, cold etc could switch a gameâ€™s focus from external action to a self-doubt/ introspection mode that had its own interest and momentum.<br/><br/>Another possibility is to use the physical environment as something that impacts the mood of the game rather than as obstacles/challenges/tasks. My 06 game chef entry capital of the eternal century incorporated mood as an outcome of conflicts and I think I had dark &amp; rain &amp; snow shift the mood outcome. <br/><br/>Anyway, this thread is nice because there should be a toolbox of ways that nature &amp; surroundings are brought into a system.<br/><br/>I canâ€™t resist including a weird quote from Taussig thatâ€™s off-point but ties into a minor fourier kick in my recent gaming. â€œAs our planet heats up and the tropics spread, it is not possible that not only a new human body but a new bodily consciousness will be created in both temperate and tropical regionsâ€¦ Charles Fourier certainly throught so, with his scheme to reorganize human society along anti-capitalist, socialst principles that encompassed sex, smell, and color, no less that money, work, and propertyâ€¦ a reinvigorated Earth, according to his estimation, would equilibrate heat so there would be less of it in the torrid zone and more of it at the poles, heterosexuality would dissolve into pansexuality, the tropics would acquire a climate like the south of France, and the Arctic would melt into a sea of lemonade. Fourier is unsettling. But then so is global warming.â€                        </div>

It turned into a roleplaying game when one of the tribesmen killed and served up of the soccer players, whereupon two of his companions vowed to kill and eat the entire tribe.                        </div>

Johua, I think most of the examples in the thread are individual characters facing down nature, so man is the potential victim, you're kicking it up to the social scale (even in a society of one like crusoe) where we can conquer.

Joshua, I don't want to get all LitCrit on you, but I think you're conflating two different tropes there.  Robinson Crusoe is the story of a man building civilization in the wilderness in partnership with his subservient native buddy -- it's a happy pocket version of colonialism. <br/><br/>I see that as a distinct trope from the survivalist story of "man vs. nature" in Jack London, or in the real life adventures of Livingston, Shackleton, and similar explorers.  I suppose they conquered nature in the sense that they reached their target and survived, but they never set out to "tame" the wilderness and make it part of civilization.  Part of the romance of their journeys is that they went to places and did things no normal man would ever want to do, and then made it back to civilization to be feted as heroes. <br/><br/>This thought process is by no means dead -- besides the Everest climbers I mentioned, I know hikers and mountain climbers who disdain the lists of "must-haves" that you're supposed to take with you into the back country.  One of them said, "When I go into the wilderness, I like it to have a fair shot at me."  That's not about taming the wilderness, that's about proving the size of one's balls by giving Mother Nature an opportunity to kick them.                        </div>

                            Danny, I get what you're saying, but you're straying pretty far outside of literature to get there.  The real-life adventures and habits of explorers are certainly inspirational to these sorts of stories, but they are not stories themselves.  I'm talking pretty strictly about the literary conflict Man vs Nature, as found in literary accounts, fictional and otherwise.                        </div>

Let's confine this to a small number of mountain climbers and hikers. I can't think of one person that I know that disdains basic safety equipment like the ten essentials. But the sentiment is understandable, after all, to survive for a month all you need is: 1. First Aide (If you survive 30 minutes after the injury, you have a 65% chance to make it 3 days), 2. Fire lighting (no fire then insulate), 3. Shelter, 4. Water, 5. Signal (three short whistle blasts). Except for the first add, I can improvise the four other when in the woods.<br/><br/>And for a survival kit according to a leading wilderness survival teacher all your survival kit needs stuff to address sleep, hydration, and maintaining body temp. If it doesnâ€™t do these then leave it at home. Your kit should reflect your level of training and have items specific to the activity or application. It has to be small enough so that you carry it on person with you, because if itâ€™s downstream in a runaway pack you canâ€™t use it. Include a knife and fire makers.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>One of them said, "When I go into the wilderness, I like it to have a fair shot at me."  That's not about taming the wilderness, that's about proving the size of one's balls by giving Mother Nature an opportunity to kick them.</blockquote>
Disclaimer: I put anything involving a tent under the heading of "extreme sports". In fact, anything involving a location without mains power and a fridge.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, a while ago at a conference I heard a "motivational speaker" who was a mountain climber. He'd lost (I think) toes, or maybe even his feet, on Everest, failing to climb it, and was preparing to go back for another try. He showed us slides, and practically every one of his friends in the pictures - including the Sherpa - had died on some mountain or other. I remember thinking, "You are suicidally insane. You should be locked up for your own protection."<br/><br/>But it seems like there's a certain type of person who feels compelled to take risks out in extreme environments, to prove - something. Maybe it <i>is</i> the size of his balls (it's usually a him). One very interesting kind of game would be the kind where the characters risk life and limb - like you do in a combat game, for that matter - but against the environment, and then you explore what that means for and about the characters - kind of like (I get the impression) Nathan's <i>carry</i> does about war. <br/><br/>There's also the scenario where the risks are not chosen instead of a quiet life out of some inner restlessness or bravado, but are the accompanying complications to achieving something that's important to the characters - rescuing the princess, escaping the invasion, finding the McGuffin, overthrowing the oppressor. That's where some kind of minigame could work well, I think, particularly one which uses the external threats as a context to explore the internal choices the characters are making.<br/><br/>Exactly how you'd do that is another question, and one better explored over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2241" rel="nofollow">Tony's thread on meshing external and internal conflicts</a>.                        </div>

                            I think the huge amount of list-and-preparation-making is typically a signal that "we don't want wilderness survival issues coming up", the interesting bits of the story are seen as being elsewhere. I think if you actually had a cool mini-game based around survival, the list-and-prepration-making would be seen a lot more like shopping for the right +1 rapier in D&amp;D. i.e. fun.                        </div>

                            I am following this thread with great interest. Unfortunately, I'm much more interested in how to do to replicate the meaningful literary Man vs. Nature, and less so in what Andy calls for as "It can be applied to any regular/trad system," which to me just sounds like an unavoidable avenue for drifting towards Sim. Cuz like, any lunk can drift to Sim.<br/><br/>JBR, you are saying some cool stuff. I'd be pleased if you keep running with it while I consider what you've already said. Gimme some examples how that might work out in a unit of gameplay or something.                        </div>

                            Larry, here's an example.  In <em>Agora</em> (think Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in tabletop), the PCs are pitted against elements of the environment (and occasionally rival factions, but we'll ignore that bit for the moment).  So you might be up against The Black Swamp as you try to establish a landing site.  You play through the scene with Dogs-like raises and sees, and at the end of the scene the PCs either triumph or they do not overcome the obstacle.  If you beat the Black Swamp, you establish your landing site and you take a trait off of the Black Swamp, rewrite it a bit, and put it on your sheet.  So the Giant Swamp Lizards 2d8 are removed from the Swamp and put on your sheet as Swamp Lizard Cavalry 2d8.  If you lose, the Black Swamp crushes your landing site and sends you running, but one of your ideals is strengthened for later.<br/><br/>Additionally, win or lose, you may have to rewrite your ideals based on the traits of the Black Swamp.  So if the Black Swamp's position was something like, "I will poison any who enter" your ideal "The tools of state are diplomacy and violence" may be rewritten to "The tools of state are poison and violence."  So just as the PCs are trying to leave their imprint on their environment, the environment leaves an imprint on them.<br/><br/>The real core of my point, I think, is that real Man vs Nature is all about a real, visceral, bone-deep engagement between man and nature, not whether one can get past the other without getting too beat up.  One or both of them will be forever changed by the conflict.  Without that sort of potential for imprint, the conflict is going to come across all loose and unengaging.                        </div>

                            Joshua, while your point is pithy, I'm now all hopped up with delight over the generation of Swamp Lizard Cavalry. I so want to play THAT game.<br/><br/>(Deep breaths... relax...) Yeah, that resonates as being on the right track. I'm trying to correlate that to actual play experience, but as Andy pointed out, such things have usually amounted to so much "drowning and falling." Hmm.                        </div>

                            One of the mechanical keys, at least for me, is that Nature gets a character sheet, traits, and especially resources to spend.  As long as you treat Nature as this bottomless well of ambient danger, you can never 'beat' it, you can only survive it, and you can't take anything away from it -- there's literally nothing there, mechanically, to take.  As soon as Nature (or the Storm or whatever) gets statted up, all the sudden there's something to engage with mechanically, there's a metric to measure victory, and there are resources to be gained from it.  Then (and in my thinking only then) can you have a Man vs Nature conflict that is expressed in the <em>game</em> as well as in the fiction.                        </div>

This takes a mature group. You can't afford a player who will feel slighted out of game when the three healthy travellers decide that they can't spare the wounded one any meat. They need all their strength to keep carrying him.                        </div>

Maturity? Well, maybe, but that sounds suspiciously like my idea of not-fun in gaming. Knocking players out of participation for the rest of the game sucks the same in Monopoly, Risk, Diplomacy, and RPGs.<br/><br/>The thoughts on how it really tests the integrity of a group's social dynamic is interesting, though. The notion that the individual, in pursuing his own selfish interests at the expense of the group, might ultimately be dooming himself is a little more sophisticated than the usual London/Hemingway/Howard social antipathy I associate with the "Man vs. Nature" thing. And it sounds like something you might be able to build an interesting game mechanic around.                        </div>

                            Nate and Russel, what you describe are Man vs Self and Man vs Society conflicts, using a hostile environment as a backdrop.  They aren't really struggles against Nature, they're struggles with oneself or one's fellow man in the context of Nature.  And they're hella fun, just not the only possibilities.                        </div>

2001, in the Cave Diving section: Clarksville Cave, New York, "stuck at constriction."<br/>My housemate and best friend, Rob Svensson. RIP.<br/><br/>The cave didn't "want" to kill him. The cave didn't "try" to kill him, nor have any intent at all. There was no grand conflict, just a shitton of pain for my other housemate, who was there when it happened. Jon tried to get Rob out until he ran out of air. Rob was stuck so badly they had to drain the cave and break his chest to get him out. I can't imagine what Jon went through.<br/><br/>Rob had the skill to get through the area he was in, and years of experience with both caves and scuba gear. In game terms, it was nothing but a botched roll - it was an adventuresome spirit combined with horrible luck, and nothing more. <br/><br/>Honestly, I'm not sure any system one could put on it would do anything but cheapen the event. I think that if this sort of thing happens in a game, either people are deeply in-character and respond, or they aren't and won't.                        </div>

                            Colin,<br/><br/>Sorry for your loss. Thanks for sharing that. It's worth remembering that each entry on that list represents not some wacky mishap from some GM's random badness table, but somebody's real-world grief.<br/><br/>Anyway... Your above comments contain the assumption that games are modeling reality, when -- for our present purposes, at least -- they do not and should not. If we're going for the literary "Man vs. Nature" struggle, then we're aiming to model narrative conventions. In this context, painful accidents attributable to "bad luck" like this <b>do not even happen</b>, or if they do, it's actually to emphasize one of the other conflicts, as Joshua pointed out above. Nothing, system-wise, needs to occur that isn't addressing premise in some way.<br/><br/>The logic of causality operates differently in good stories than it does in the real world. I suggest that demanding a game of Man vs. Nature should respect the reality of an actual tragedy is a little akin to demanding that every game of unrepentant orc-slaying should respect the ugly psychological damage inflicted upon real-world Vietnam war vets.                        </div>
