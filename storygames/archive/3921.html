To this date he hasn't been able to get into a Spirit of the Century game or a Burning Wheel game (among others), despite the fact that he logs on and registers for events at the first possible moment.<br/><br/>I haven't been to a big con in a while myself, but I always download the latest event catalog and check out what games are being played. I'm pleased to see indie/small press games being played, but surprised that there aren't very many of them. A lot of people are wary of buying new games sight unseen these days and many go to cons specifically to check out games they normally wouldn't get a chance to play. This seems like a prime opportunity to pimp your game, get the word out about it and hopefully make a few new fans who will buy the game and go out and further spread the word.<br/><br/>I can imagine that it's tough for game designers who do make it to the cons to run games, occupy a booth, and to still have some "me time" for playing other games and having fun. Still, the conventions could certainly use more slots of your games in most cases.<br/><br/>I know IPR has the Press Gang, and that seems like a good start, but maybe someone should start using a model more like FanPro was using. GMs who ran Shadowrun at events got "credit" toward FanPro products. My friend runs one or two SR events per con and after a bit scored himself another rulebook and a GM's screen. Perhaps if IPR or individual publishers started some kind of "rewards" program as incentive to get some of their fans to run more events at cons, then more people would be able to check out the games in actual play and hopefully  generate more sales.<br/><br/>I don't know what the magic answer is exactly, but I think there somehow needs to be a concerted effort to get more small-press games being run at cons. <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Jeff                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87973/#Comment_87973" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T06:31:03+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  6:31AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see more games being offered in general, and my games specifically!  People who step up and volunteer to run them are the best friends a publisher can have.  I think there are many people who attend cons specifically to play, and might not even consider facilitating a game or two.  I'd love to find ways to persuade them to change their views.  Low-prep Gmless games ought to make this easy - you want to play anyway, why not ensure you get the chance by volunteering to facilitate?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87980/#Comment_87980" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T07:00:15+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  7:00AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple thoughts. First, are you aware of Games On Demand, GoOrange? Many/most of the Forge folks, at least, and probably some other small-press folks, seem to be doing this in lieu of specific scheduled games. I'll finally be checking it out this year, and maybe running some stuff, but from what i've heard it works reasonably well. <br/><br/>Second, we've always gone the opposite route to most of the small-press folks (at least those that i'm aware of): we spend all our effort on scheduled games, and don't bother with a booth, or try to do short-format demos. At best, our stuff is available through somebody else's booth, but they're really just a sales agent and we don't expect them to know much more than the basics about the game. And we drum up extra GMs to make this possible--this year we're a bit anemic, with only 4.5 GMs, but we have had as many as 7 people, each running 16hrs+ of our games, at GenCon in the past. <br/><br/>Oh, part of the trick for enticing GMs: in addition to all our games being conducive to a lot of improv, we provide the characters, detailed scenarios (when necessary), and all the other tools the GM might need (player handouts, that sort of stuff). So really all they need to do is read the materials and run the game--the only prep is whatever they need to feel comfortable, without having to come up with a scenario (or initial situation, or whatever) themselves.

Scenarios, character sheets, handouts, cheat sheets etc. can go a long way toward lessening the burden on prospective GMs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
