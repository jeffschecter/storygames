The siren's call of the ENnies has been sounded and the question goes out; who will answer? Do you think you have what it takes to be an ENnies judge? Do you have the fortitude to stand up against the barrage of RPG  products, the reflexes to navigate the plethora of text and toys, and the will to emerge with the finest goods produced during the year? If so, then this is a great opportunity for you!<br/><br/>Starting on July 1, 2011, people will be able to throw their hats into the ring and nominate themselves. The last day for nominating will be July 10, so you'll have plenty of time to make your decision. Voting for the judges will take place alongside voting for products and the winners will be announced at the ENnie Awards ceremony on August 5, 2011. Keep any eye out for my next post with a link to the form.<br/><br/>If you want more information about the current judges, please visit the judges page on the ENnie Awards site: <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?page_id=12" rel="nofollow">http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?page_id=12</a>. Also, all current judges will be following this post, so feel free to ask questions of them.<br/><br/>If you are thinking about running, here's a list of criteria you'll need to remember. All judges must:<br/><br/>- be at least 18 years of age as of August 5th, 2011 and able to enter into a legal contract;<br/>- not have any professional relationship with any RPG publisher during the period from January 1st, 2010 to August 1st, 2012. Such relationships include unpaid work and work on free products;<br/>- declare any relationship with any publisher in which they receive money, product, or special consideration in exchange for their services;<br/>- be able to read English and communicate clearly therein.<br/><br/>If you have a relationship with a publisher, even as a playtester, it is important that you notify the ENnies board of this so that we may determine whether you are eligible to seek a judge position.  In cases of a rule violation, conflict of interest,  misrepresentation, or other factor(s) detrimental to the awards, the Board of Directors retains the right to alter the composition of the judging panel at any time.<br/><br/>Physical location is irrelevant - so long as you can accept packages year-round.<br/><br/>When you apply, you will be expected to fill out a questionnaire to help people best gauge how well they think you'll work as a judge. Here are a few sample questions:<br/><br/>- What styles and genres of RPGs do you enjoy most? Are there any styles or genres that you do not enjoy? Which games best exemplify what you like?  Do you consider yourself a particular system\u2019s, publisher\u2019s or genre\u2019s \u201cfanboy/girl\u201d?  <br/>- How would you like to see the ENnies change (categories, policies, etc)?  What should remain inviolate?<br/><br/>If you want to run, here is what is expected of you. All judges shall:<br/><br/>- access the ENnie Awards boards/e-mailing lists (for the purposes of corresponding with judges and interacting with directors and staff);<br/>       - weekly on the designated ENnies forums and sharing an accurate list of what products they have received;<br/>       - daily on the designated ENnies forums during judge deliberations (expected dates for 2012: June 1 - July 1);<br/>- act in a professional and impartial manner;<br/>- sign a non-disclosure agreement;<br/>- in the event that they are removed from office, bear the expense of returning and/or forwarding the products received for review;<br/>- pay any customs duties charged for submissions;<br/>- if they attend Gen Con \u2013 Indy, work a minimum of two hours at the ENnies booth;<br/>- if they attend Gen Con \u2013 Indy, attend the awards ceremony smartly attired;<br/>- report to the Submissions Coordinator and Business Manager.<br/><br/>And, besides being able to say "I'm an ENnies Judge!" what else do you get? Judges:<br/><br/>- upon completion of reviewing, retain for personal use or otherwise dispose of products reviewed;<br/>- receive a free Gen Con Indy 4-day pass.<br/><br/>Tony Law<br/>ENnies Assistant Business Manager<br/>tony@ennie-awards.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330471/#Comment_330471" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T13:15:07+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  1:15PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tonylaw74</cite>All judges must:<br/>...<br/>- not have any professional relationship with any RPG publisher during the period from January 1st, 2010 to August 1st, 2012.

The reason I put playtester in there is because we want to know of any relationship a person has had with a publisher. What I don't want is a person with an agenda who wishes to push their favorite product(s) to the detriment of other products. By doing this, we make a decision as to whether to allow a person.<br/><br/>With that said, in the past we've had judges who did playtesting but were allowed to still judge the ENnies because it was determined they didn't have more of a relationship than that and that they weren't going to push a particular publishers agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330814/#Comment_330814" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T08:14:16+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  8:14AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tonylaw74</cite>- not have any professional relationship with any RPG publisher during the period from January 1st, 2010 to August 1st, 2012.

I'm a big fan of With Great Power... (my favorite supers game), Prime Time Adventures, and games that don't quite  make it to StoryGame territory but involve a distribution of narrative control.  FATE, for example, with my friends ends up being a game of token management driving story details forward to create a group narrative more than anything else.  Don't let me mislead you, though.  I love a classic dungeon crawl as well, and my taste in games is best described as broad and accepting.<br/><br/>My platform for this year, as with last year, is intense amounts of actual play.  I identified strongly with the idea of GoPlay when I first heard of it and have really taken it to heart.  When I evaluate a game for the ENnies I want to do so based on having had at least a session or two with one of my great gaming groups, because that's when I can really tell if the mechanics bring the game to life at the table.  I will share my findings with other judges, and I'll also try to coordinate with them to make sure that as many games get played as possible.  With so many entries it can be difficult to play every single product, but with teamwork and communication we can work together to make sure every game gets a fair shot.<br/><br/>If you're interested in reading more <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?page_id=2228" rel="nofollow">you can find a list of all ENnies judges along with their bios here</a>, and <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?page_id=2284" rel="nofollow">my bio can be found here.</a><br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hooper" title="Hooper"><img alt="Hooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hooper">Hooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334014/#Comment_334014" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T10:28:42+00:00" title="July 12, 2011 10:28AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2011 10:30AM by Hooper.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Bazin above.

If you are asked to judge a game you haven't played, what would you do?</b><br/><br/>Play the game.  If time is a barrier, then coordinate with the other judges to make sure the game gets played and then give that judge's views a little more weight.  I mention time as a potential barrier only because some companies will not submit until the very last minute.  Otherwise, play the game.<br/><br/><b><br/>2. How do you feel about the Best Free Product category including both actual free games AND marketing materials that are technically free but part of a much larger commercial game?</b><br/><br/>I strongly dislike the current status of the Best Free Product category.  Quoted below, I already have expressed this idea on the nominee form with regard to beta products which we have seen a number of in the past two years.  Let's make room for the many other free products to compete here, such as the wonderful Iron Lich from this year.<br/><br/>"I\u2019d like to see the ENnies only accept products in their final form. While this would exclude beta documents, I think it would aid the rewards in preventing some products from effectively being entered twice. Let the beta products compete once they\u2019re finalized. It\u2019s a hard decision to make in some respects, as I have seen some unbelievably high quality beta products out there and I have considered them as an ENnies judge in the past, but I want to avoid situations where beta documents are competing with other Free Products."<br/><b><br/>3.

How do you refrain from simply choosing a game you like (even if what you like about it isn't relevant to the category at hand) vs. a game you don't know well enough? Does that matter?</b><br/><br/>There's no doubt that there will always be some bias.  To have enough interest in the hobby to want to do this sort of hardcore playing and evaluating means a person has surely found games they like and games they don't.  The easiest solution is to play the game.  I run a lot of short campaigns, and at the height of the ENnies at least one of my groups will become a playtest group for trying out lots of different scenarios.  Further, checking bias against other judges is very helpful.  The process involves reaching consensus, and keeping an open mind to arguments made by the rest of the panel can do a lot to help prevent one judge's preferences from dominating the awards.  I am definitely willing, then, to both play as many games as I can and to give the views of my colleagues all due weight.<br/><br/><b>4. In a word where many GMs are in essence, amateur designers, and where publishing is as simple as copy and pasting your rules hack into a blog post\u2026 how do you feel about the ENnies prohibiting any publishers from becoming judges, even if none of their content is up for nomination?</b><br/><br/>Recent years have blurred the lines between classic hobbyist and designer.  I believe the ENnies currently allows creators who haven't done any work for two years to compete.  I understand why the ENnies does it - they want to try and keep the awards open to more casual fans and are concerned that allowing active creators to participate will turn it into an industry award.  That said, I believe a more lax attitude towards who can compete to be a judge would be good for the ENnies.  It has been argued, correctly, that the current system largely excludes a lot of passionate people and entire communities from participation on the simple basis of the fact that they're producing awesome games for everyone to enjoy.  I'd still like to see the focus be on fan awards.  Allowing, for example, a full time member of the D&amp;D design team to be a judge would really put an end to the "fan" aspect of the awards.  Still, there should be more flexibility to allow a broader range of people to become judges.  What system that would be, I don't know, but I bet Tony Law (ENnies coordinator) would be happy to talk about the possibilities.<br/><b><br/>5. What don't you like about the ENnies?</b><br/><br/>I really don't like the Free Product category as it currently stands, for the reasons mentioned above.  I'd also like to see the awards try to avoid products that are only loosely connected to RPGs, such as board games.  Finally, I'd like to see a little more support for fan nomination of products to be voted on similar to how the Best Publisher award is currently determined.  Even if it starts as just a single entry every year, with the top five nominations through the site being posted for a final vote, I'd be happy to see a little more support for community involvement outside of what the judges are doing.<br/><br/><b>6. What do you like about the ENnies?</b><br/><br/>The ENnies, as I see it, is a fun community celebration of games.  It's not a perfect way of picking the very best product of every year.  It's really just about a few game fans playing a whole bunch of games, talking about them, and then getting the community at large to vote for the ones they think are most awesome.  I really dig that.  While there's always some grouching about it here and there, I've found it to be a very positive experience deeply rooted in an attempt to get people talking about and playing games they might not otherwise have noticed.  The Laundry, for example, completely flew under my radar until I discovered it thanks to the ENnies this past year and I'm glad to have noticed it.  So, I like the celebratory aspect of the awards.  They'll never be completely perfect, but they are fun and they do encourage people to try out great new games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334043/#Comment_334043" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T13:16:14+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  1:16PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Potential Ennies judges: tell us something interesting.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to play everything that I\u2019ve not played that I\u2019ll be asked to judge, but as noted by Chris, with 5 judges, we can work to get as many products judged based on play as possible.<br/>\nAlso, I wouldn\u2019t limit my exposure to play comments to my fellow judges.  Checking in on forums and finding out what others think is also pretty important, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>2. How do you feel about the Best Free Product category including both actual free games AND marketing materials that are technically free but part of a much larger commercial game? </b><br/>\n<br/>\nI think the category could be better served as two categories, Free Products and Quickstarts.  With that said, there are a few larger games that do reasonably regularly put out free products that aren\u2019t Quickstarts.  So, with that in mind, maybe they should be lumped together.<br/>\nNow, with the specific example that you gave, I don\u2019t think those products should be judged together, they are trying to achieve a different purpose, in my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>3.

Does that matter? </b><br/>\n<br/>\nYou can\u2019t avoid bias, but you can be fair.  If I\u2019m judging a game I have little exposure to against a game I have a lot of exposure too, I\u2019d use the same methodology and criteria when judging them.  By having the methodology in place to back up selections, I can ensure that I\u2019m not picking what I like over something else.  It think it\u2019s important to put each product through the same criteria, it increases fairness.  By having 5 judges, many biases can also be tempered, as not everyone on the panel will have the same bias.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>4.

What do you like about the ENnies?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI like that I\u2019m getting the opportunity to potentially take a look at a variety of new material and present a short list of what I feel were the best products for that year.  I like that anyone (meeting the guidelines) can put their name forward to judge.

Doing things with friends is fun to begin with, and when story building gets factored in it's a great time.  I love hanging out with them and watching movies or playing board games, too, but the height of joy is completely different with RPGs.  That moment when a great betrayal has occured, when a goal has been reached or lost, when a character changes, that's just tremendous fun.<br><br>The most fun game I played this last year was definitely my hacked up FATE/LoA Shadowrun game.  It focused on corporate police investigating various strange occurences leading up to a corp war while trying to deal with their various personal issues.  The setting was almost completely player generated, as we really just cherry pick what we like from established settings, and we created our own systems for cyberware, magic, etc.  Lots of energy at the table, lots of big moments, and a very consistent sense of who the characters are led to a fun game.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bazin" title="Bazin"><img alt="Bazin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bazin">Bazin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334053/#Comment_334053" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T13:35:11+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  1:35PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, its a safe answer.

If the community feels that that designer will have an unfavorable effect on the judge panel, then so be it - they won't be elected.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne could argue that having a designer on the panel one year, than said designer submits the following year (and say, the panel has several repeat judges from the prior year), one might question if that product would get treated appropriately during the judging.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think regardless of what the rules surrounding judges are, there will be controversy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hooper" title="Hooper"><img alt="Hooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hooper">Hooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334068/#Comment_334068" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T14:21:48+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  2:21PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some really great questions!

If you are asked to judge a game you haven't played, what would you do?</br></blockquote>\nI believe this may sound similar to what you've already heard, but the plain simple truth is: Play the game.  Yes, no matter how hard we all try we may not be able to devote the time each game deserves, especially for later submissions, and in those cases we should rely not only on the opinions of the fellow elected judges, but also on our own gaming group support network.  It seems it is true for the other nominees (at least the ones who have answered above), but you're not really getting a single candidate as much as your getting an entire gaming group for the price of one person.\n<blockquote><br>2. How do you feel about the Best Free Product category including both actual free games AND marketing materials that are technically free but part of a much larger commercial game?<br><br>For example, having Old School Hack (a complete free RPG) and Paizo's Ultimate Combat Playtesting PDF (an incomplete playtest provided so that fans can work to make the final commercial game better) in the same category?</br></br></br></blockquote>\nWhen I originally read the question, I knew my answer, but I have to thank fellow-nominee Bazin for finding the words I was having trouble finding in order to describe it.  I agree that there should be a split between truly free complete products, and any demo or quickstart or testing material.   Furthermore, I'm not 100 percent sure that I'd want to keep the award open at all for incomplete products, but at the same time I do understand that they do have a large impact on the fans and maybe they deserve some recognition.  This is a issue I would have to continue to think on for some time, and get more input on.\n<blockquote><br>3. Does bias matter? It's possible that a judge will be asked to weigh a game they are currently playing against a game they have minimal or no exposure to. What do you do in that situation? How do you refrain from simply choosing a game you like (even if what you like about it isn't relevant to the category at hand) vs. a game you don't know well enough? Does that matter?</br></blockquote>\nAs I mentioned in my nomination, I feel like each item should be graded based on a set list of guidelines, that may be different from judge to judge but keep that judge from altering a decision based on personal opinion from experiences outside the test.\n<blockquote><br>4. In a word where many GMs are in essence, amateur designers, and where publishing is as simple as copy and pasting your rules hack into a blog post\u2026 how do you feel about the ENnies prohibiting any publishers from becoming judges, even if none of their content is up for nomination?</br></blockquote>\nI believe that there needs to be some leeway.  For example, in the above mentioned ways, if I were the person making the decision on who could be a nominee and who could not - I would allow the person blogging rules hacks and homebrew, but a amateur designer may not make it.  The reasoning is, even if they do not have content up for nomination - they may have to judge materials that could be seen as competition to their piece of the marketplace.  Would every publisher downgrade a submission because it may compete with them?  No.  But the easiest way to keep this from happening is to prevent it in the first place.  Yes, its frustrating - but it facilitates a fan based award program.\n<blockquote><br>5. What don't you like about the ENnies?</br></blockquote>\nThis may seem odd, and I share this issue with other RPG awards: the lack of a advocacy category.  RPG advocacy is extremely important, sadly because of lies, myths, and misconceptions that have arisen over the years from the media and certain interest groups.  A lot of people tend to believe that it isn't necessary anymore, but I would argue the complete opposite.  I personally know individuals who were not allowed access to gaming as youth because of parent, school, or church concerns.  This year I do see that a advocacy website is up for best website, and maybe that is a sign that someone understands how important it is.\n<blockquote><br>6. What do you like about the ENnies?</br></blockquote>\nWithout a doubt the fan-based nature of them.  I know there is a large section of gamers who completely ridicule the awards because they're "voted for on the internet" or because they "don't showcase the real fan favorites."  I think the openness is the best way to vote for them, and the only time they don't showcase a supposedly fan favorite is if the fans of that game are too lethargic or "meh" about them to even vote - a circular issue that will forever keep some upset with the awards.  We can't please everyone (if any of you know how to make Frank Trollman happy, please let me know), but the openness gives us the best opportunity for a true reflection of how the consumers of a industry feel about that industry's product.\n<blockquote>Potential Ennies judges: tell us something interesting. Tell us what makes you passionate about games. If you don't like indie games, that's absolutely cool (and better than saying you've always wanted to play Lacuna). Tell us the best game you've played this year.</blockquote>\nThe friends I've met through gaming have turned it from just something I occasionally do, to a hobby, finally to a large part of my identity.  The times I've had around a tabletop with people have been phenomenal, and I truly love some people I would of never met without it but can't fathom not having in my life now.  Now, with children, beginning to introduce them to gaming (side note: if you have a toddler, let me give you a template to create custom "Guess Who?" cards for the classic board game.  Your kids will love guessing for Batman, ALF, Dora, etc.) has been really remarkable.  I can actually see them using problem solving skills and having fun.  Its amazing.<br><br>The best game I've played this year, without a doubt, is All-Stars.  The premise of the game is that you are a remarkably low powered "super" "hero."  The designer described it as a "JLA if JLA was only Aquaman" but since I am a huge fan of Aquaman and actually respect that he is the most powerful member of the team, I disagree with that, but I digress..... The reason it was the best game recently was because the players really created remarkable characters, a hilariously ill-named team, and had the greatest misadventures ever.  <br><br>I'm currently really pumped up for a Valgora campaign I'll be running starting in August (homebrew setting 3.5), which has absolutely no story.  Sandbox adventuring, and the characters that are being made so far have me really excited to test my abilities as a GM.\n<blockquote>Because JD does have a point. Every year, all the potential Ennies judges come here and say...well, not much, actually. So, you know, tell us what's different about you. </blockquote>\nI think I'm coming at this from a different mindset than most people.  I'm not doing this for name recognition, to get a inside scoop, because I feel like I personally am "smarter/better/wiser" than previous judges, or any similar nonsense.  I'm not submitting for me - I'm submitting for my gaming group.  You see, this next year, and every foreseeable year after, I'm going to be gaming.  Nothing is going to stop that.  I'm doing this because it gives my gaming group a chance to try out games we may not otherwise, to dig into the games aggressively, and to really appreciate the content.  I'm going into this from a perspective of I don't care who made the game, the history or background or skeletons in the closet of a company or industry individual.   When we sit down at the table and play the game, is it fun?  Did we have a good time?  Did the game do what it set out to do? Did I mention, Did we have fun?  <br><br>Lets break through all the barriers and just play the game.  Or look at the art and really appreciate it simply for what it is.  Etc.<br><br>Some people will not agree with that mindset.  That is absolutely fine, and I hope they find some candidates that they agree with and can vote enthusiastically.  If someone wants a judge who will be making decisions on a root basis on the enjoyability of a product, I believe I can be that guy - with the support of a phenomenal group of gamers and other elected judges!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334181/#Comment_334181" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T07:10:51+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  7:10AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>If you don't like indie games, that's absolutely cool (and better than saying you've always wanted to play Lacuna)</blockquote>\nWhat if I always <i>have</i> wanted to play Lacuna?
