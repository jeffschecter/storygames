                    I've been thinking about fantasy alot lately, as it pertains to my design work for "In a Land Called". Last night I had a conversation about it with my wife on the subject, prompted by a <a href="http://gamingphilosopher.blogspot.com/2006/10/fantasy-elfland-poughkeepsie-hogwarts.html" rel="nofollow">blog post by Victor</a>.<br/><br/>We came up with a few things that "make" fantasy, or at least, elements that make up what fantasy is.<br/><br/><b>Simplified Reality</b>: My wife said the reason she likes fantasy is that everything is so simple, so clear. There's a clear order to things, and when something goes wrong, it's clear why it did and what needs to be done to fix it. The vague-ness of life is removed.<br/><br/><b>Exaggerated Reality</b>: I added that reality has a certain exaggerated quality to it. I think this goes along with the above. Life isn't just black and white, it's also good-very-good and evil-bad-evil. Men are strong, monsters tough, and castles big.<br/><br/><b>Externalized Reality</b>: My insight into fantasy is that internal emotions, struggles, and conflicts are externalized and given literal form. This is why I believe fantasy is most often about physical violence. The physical nature of violence is an externalized form of the internal struggle we feel everyday. I believe this element is combined with the two points above to create the kind of grand imagery we associate with fantasy, such as monsters and knights.<br/><br/><b>Otherness?</b> Victor argues in his blog that fantasy has a certian "otherness" about it, that the reality of fantasy must be different from the reality we live with. I'm not sure if this is a distinct trait or if it's just a side-effect of the above points.<br/><br/><b>Wonderment?</b> This might just be another word to describe the "otherness" Victor mentions, but fantasy  tends to have a certain "wonderment" factor. There's something about good fantasy that connects with our childhood non-rational mind and emotions. I'm curious if people think this is a distinct quality unto itself or if it's a side-effect of other factors.<br/><br/>What do you think? Have I missed anything? I know there's the medieval color thing, but I think that's a given.                </div>

<p>I'm not so sure "Simplified Reality" is true about fantasy in general, as opposed to specific subgenres. Clark Ashton Smith's stories often had moral ambiguity, and Eddison's <em>The Worm Ouroboros</em> is filled with a bunch of morally black-and-white characters -- and Lord Gro, who is extremely complex.</p>
<p>There's a tendency for fantasy to look backwards instead of forwards, the way science fiction does. The few cases where the fantasy is set in the future or has an ostensibly futuristic setting, it usually involves a return to the ways of the past, like the Barsoom books.</p>

                            I can add a few thoughts to this list. The caveat is that there are heaps of great fantasy settings that specifically trope one or more of the "classic" aspects of the genre.<br/><br/><b>Absolute good and evil</b> Tolkien and Lewis in particular stamped this characteristic on fantasy. Both beleived in absolute good and evil, and they wanted a world where that conflict was explicit in the world. A trope of this might be Talislanta, that doesn't have any absolute good and evil, or Warhammer, which uses Chaos and Law as its poles.<br/><br/><b>Cosmology</b> Most fantasy worlds are specifically constructed worlds. Again, Tolkien has a lot to do with this. I can't think of a fantasy setting that's specifically not a constructructed world, but I bet there is one.<br/><br/><b>Strange</b> Fantasy carries a strong flavor of the strange. Just around the next corner is something new and unprecendented that you've never seen before and you never would have expected. Pratchett's Diskworld tropes this norm by continually hitting you with familiar concepts that don't normally belong in a fantasy setting. One of his novels focuses on an equal opportunity employer hiring monsters to work in the city watch. OK, you had "wonderment", so I guess we're talking about the same thing. Fantasy is typically not the alienating strangeness you find in Kafka, nor the unstructured strangeness of a Marquez novel. Maybe it's strangeness with an exaplanation, possibly rooted in the cosmology.<br/><br/><b>Myth</b> Fantasy reads like a myth. Fantasy seems to take place in that before time when the mundane and mythical walked the earth together.                        </div>

                            I once upon a time, long long ago read an essay about the differences between Sci Fi and fantasy which added another element to the mix (sort of a cross of your externalized and simplified realities): emotional realism. Which is to say that in fantasy the thing that is most emotionally cathartic is often the correct thing to do, as opposed to SF where the most logical thing is often the correct thing to do. <br/><br/>Thus in fantasy if you suspect your wife may be possessed and her possession could destroy the whole town, and all the authorities tell you there is no way to save her, you fight tooth and nail to save her because love is the most important thing! In SF, otoh, you may well take the opposite course of action. (It's worth noting that this essay said that most SF looking movies are really fantasy with SF costumes on, as its a rare movie that places the values of logic, science, and intellect above those of the emotional heart and tear jerking cathartic response.) <br/><br/>Anyway, I was never sure how much I agreed with the essay, but it did make an interesting argument. Fantasy worlds are ruled by the heart, SF world are ruled by the head. <br/><br/>The other thing that the combination of Simplified, Exaggerated, Emotionalized, and Externalized gives us is a lot of disguised political rhetoric in fantasy. A lot of fantasy fans will like or not like a fantasy story based on how closely its unacknowledged and unexamined ideals of issues of power, race, violence, sexism and similar issues match with their unacknowledged and unexamined ideals of the same. Because fantasy is made of such big bold strokes it fits into much the same "meaning making" niche that legend and myth used to, right alongside comic books and propaganda pamphlets. <br/><br/>Because of this many fantasy worlds have dual issues of "how I wish the world really was" and "how I fear the world really is" running about under a thin layer of elf-eared frosting. In good fantasy this is theme making, in mediocre fantasy its transparently allegorical, and in poor fantasy it is masturbatory and full of smirking self-congratulations.                        </div>

                            Tim, I don't know if this fits or not, but:<br/><br/><b>Everything you see, ties into theme</b><br/><br/>In most fantasy, you don't see something unless it supports the theme and tone.<br/>If a kingdom is on the good guy side, they don't show police brutalizing women or a slave trade or religious oppression. Considering the medieval influence, these things were present everywhere, but in (at least, a lot of) fantasy these things are hidden and unexplored if they conflict with what the nation represents.<br/><br/>Poorly worded, but do you get the idea? Highly-veiled world. You see what's important, you don't see what's problematic.<br/>Do you agree with that?                        </div>

                            Tim, I suspect the externalized reality bit is a red herring -- externalized reality is one of the cornerstones of fiction.  You'll find it in all stories, even John Grisham novels.  Perhaps fantasy does it in a particular <em>way</em>, but the fact that it does it at all doesn't separate it out from everything else.<br/><br/>...and Joe, I think what you're identifying is part and parcel of good storytelling.  If it appears, it's relevant; if it doesn't appear, it's not relevant, and vice-versa on both.                        </div>

<p>Hm, to echo what John said... you're listing out some earmarks of what I'd call fantasy, but not everything that falls under that umbrella carries all those earmarks. The 'medieval color is a given' thing, especially, is like specific to one (startlingly large) subgenre, but outside of it you see things like Geraldine Harris' <em>Seven Gates</em> series, Earthsea, Riddlemaster, McKinley's <em>The Hero and the Crown,</em> Meredith Ann Pierce's <em>Darkangel</em> trilogy, Paula Volsky's <em>Gates of Twilight,</em> and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>These all share the quality of being set in pre-industrial (or Barsoomish post-industrial, returning-to-pld-ways), pre-electrical societies, but my feeling is that this is because it gives the authors a stronger palette of images to work with -- it's clear in <em>The Blue Sword,</em> the sequel to McKinley's other novel, and in <em>Gates of Twilight,</em> that other, more industrialised societies exist, but they are not the primary source of color; I think it's because their color is weaker.</p>

                            Frank, <br/><br/>Not just Star Wars, but the Matrix (obviously) to ... oh hell.. just about all of it. <br/><br/>I think 2001, Solaris, and a handful of others can actually claim to be SF under this essay's definition -- but the list is going to be pretty short. I mean really, how many movies do we get where when the hot young protagonist is told by his superiors that he needs to give himself up and stand trial/be quaranteened/tested/anything because it's the logical thing to do, he actually does it? And how many do we get where he screams, "No! I am not an animal!" and then blows a hole in the door and runs away to prove his innocence by killing lots of people?                        </div>

I've always felt that myth and morality have played large roles in fantasy.  Those terms can be massaged to mean several different things, but they are two key ingredients IMHO.<br/>

                            I'm not sure how useful it is to define fantasy based on structure or theme or even technique.  It seems to me that the one thing that ties together most fantasy stories (whether we're talking about Tolkien's or Peake's or George R.R. Martin's or James P. Blaylock's) is that they pretend that something imaginary - often drawn from mythology and/or legend - is real.<br/><br/>To the extent fantasy stories have deeper, structural &amp; thematic similarities, I'd guess that is because, most of the time, generically, they are all romances (in the lit-crit sense of both romance and genre).  So they'll share these elements (simplified good vs. evil, for example), with other romances (conventional Westerns, for example).<br/><br/>A possible problem with the way I've defined it here, is that it doesn't differentiate at all between what we usually think of as Fantasy and what we usually think of as Horror.                        </div>

Joshua, what I was trying to articulate is that things that are PROBLEMATIC simply don't appear.<br/><br/>Example: Maybe Gondor relied on slave trading to maintain its economy.<br/>It's not "slave trading in Gondor isn't relevant, let's skip it"<br/>It's "slave trading in Gondor would blur our conception of whether Gondor was a noble state or not, let's completely write it out of the story"<br/><br/>There is an avoidance of problematic information that could muddy our view of a nation or person, unless that muddied view is the point..<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>

                            Jon, <br/><br/>Very true. But then horror also often pretends that something imainary, drawn from mythology and/or legend (and or opium induced dreams derived from too many readings of Revelations) are real. <br/><br/>Horror and fantasy often feal like two sides of the same coin to me. On one side the world of our emotions and hearts leads us to someplace good through someplace dark, and on the other it leads us only deeper into the dark.                        </div>

                            Can anyone identify any fantasy genre that does NOT contain what we we pretty sensibly point to and say "that's supernatural"? I can't think of any off hand. <br/><br/>But, theoretically, I can envision two broad categories of fantasy stories. Those that could be reasonably "rewritten" without losing significant thematic quality in other genres and those that requires supernatural and/or fantastical elements to survive as stories (i.e. that lose their thematic quality in other genres).<br/><br/>Are there such stories in the latter category? I can't immediately think of any, which is either frightening or enlightening somehow. What fantasy stories absolutely require themselves to be fantasy stories (because it's impossible to recast them otherwise)? And, are fantasy stories that in no way require this "true" fantasty stories, or are they "lesser" fantasy stories?<br/><br/>(Similary, for science fiction, are there stories that absolutely require the involvement of SOME level of science or technology to exists as whole stoires? Are there stories that can be "recast"? Is one or the other a "lesser" science fiction story?)                        </div>

                            There are some non-supernatural "fantasy" novels out there, Matt, but they are few and far in between.  (In fact, I was really digging on Game of Thrones until magic cropped up like a sore thumb halfway through the book.)  So the supernatural is probably safe to consider as a fundamental part of the genre.<br/><br/>Joe, so you mean that your vision of fantasy promotes simplified and uncomplicated characterizations?  I don't see this in Earthsea, which is hugely complicated and ambiguous, but Le Guin is something of an outlier, anyway.  If you go much further back, you're getting into the pulps and I'll agree that they aren't complicated at all, since that would have taken time to write, and maybe revisions, and the medium couldn't bear that at the time.  More recently, though, as I understand it the Game of Thrones / Song of Ice and Fire presents a very complicated sociopolitical set up, presenting main characters first as villains, then as heroes, then as fools, and so on.                        </div>

                            I have a somewhat different take on this idea. It's not quite, IMO, that fantasy is from the heart, and sci-fi from the head. Indeed, I'm sure we can find all sorts of examples of fantasy characters acting logically, and sci-fi characters acting from the heart. Assimov's characters tend to be heart-oriented, and it would be hard to see the work of the man who coined the term Speculative Fiction as other than Speculative Fiction.<br/>
<br/>
What's really going on is that fantasy assumes that the pre-rational mindset is true in the world of the fiction. Put more simply, magic works, or at least seems to from the character's POVs. Sure, it's possible to see the magic in Conan as smoke and mirrors - I recall one story where Conan actually deduces that this is true with one magician. But Thoth-amon's magic sure seems "real." To say nothing of the supernatural beings that litter the stories. Demons, gods, giant slugs.<br/>
<br/>
Sure we can postulate these things as having some sort of rational existence in the world in question. We can make it a sci-fi world if we want. Jorune and Tekumel both do this to an extent, actually. Anne McCaffrey does it in Pern. The difference between Pern and the world of Greyhawk is simply that we assume <i>a priori</i> that magic is real and does work in the fantasy world.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, from that POV, fantasy is just a large subset of Speculative Fiction that focuses on the question, "What if magic and the byproducts of magic were real?"<br/>
<br/>
By byproducts I mean dragons and such. Beings that only make sense if magic works. Oh, sure, again we can talk about telekinesis, and propose it having some basis in physics, and explain away the dragon as just a very interesting animal. But, again, in fantasy we don't do that. We instead assume that the dragon can fly because that's it's nature, and that in this world, that's enough to make it fly.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, fantasy literature makes the assumption that pre-rational societies do, that physics doesn't exist. Rather that the "natural" explanation for how things work is based on the mythic underpinnings of the thing in question. Spiders don't spin webs because they've evolved to do that, they spin webs because they all descend from Arachne under whose curse they suffer. That, in fact, everything can be explained by this sort of account of it's origin, if you only know it. That all things come from this sort of mythic origin.<br/>
<br/>
What's fascinating is how in RPGs we're constantly trying to make magic something that exists on top of a rational universe. John Kim has a good essay on this subject:  <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/magic/antiscience.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/magic/antiscience.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure why this is.<br/>
<br/>
But does Elrond use some psionic powers to be magical? Nope, in fact he's never seen even doing a "spell" or anything. What's magical about him is that he is unaging, and that everything he does has an aura of grace about it. Things he creates have qualities that mortals cannot embue to their creations. Elrond just <i>is</i> magical. Middle-Earth isn't just a place where magic exists inside an environ governed by physics...Middle-Earth <i>is</i> magical. And so is everything in it. Some of it is just more obviously magical than other parts. It was all created by Illuvatar, and it all functions according to the way he created it. Not to some impersonal physics that pre-exist.<br/>
<br/>
It's in this way that fantasy is like Myth. The sense of wonder comes from the awe of understanding that the universe in question has meaning embedded in it. That it's not the impersonal universe that we live in today. I think that all the other trappings are unimportant. Simplified reality? Well, no, just one which makes sense, because it was not created impersonally. Exaggerated reality? Well, not really, just a non-rational reality. Otherness, wonder? Well, that's the attraction of magic, something we've discarded largely in our world.<br/>
<br/>
At least that's how I've understood fantasy for a long time now.<br/>

Isnt that more covering up the issue than solving it?

This statement made me laugh. A lot. I think I wanna see a completely modern-world, mundane, slice-of-life story where there's <i>one guy</i> who constantly reacts like this.<br><br>And on a more serious note, I think that:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>many fantasy worlds have dual issues of "how I wish the world really was" and "how I fear the world really is" running about under a thin layer of elf-eared frosting</blockquote>
is a very useful and insightful observation. It's not always a black and white Absolute Good vs. Absolute Evil kind of thing. Having that underlying tension makes for some really powerful storytelling. Even Tolkien wrestled with the idea of his Orcs being irredeemably evil, and came right out and SAID that for the main characters, the line ain't so easy to draw.<br><br>And on that note:

                            Mike Holmes has aced it, I think. Fantasy at its root is premodern and mythic in its worldview - things work because they make mythic or metaphorical sense, not rational or scientific sense. This is why, I think, most fantasy novels that have an elaborate "This is how magic works, you have your four elements and your seven whozits and they interact to produce..." fall rather flat for me.<br><br>Tolkien and Lewis have been tremendously influential on modern fantasy (though they certainly didn't invent it), and they were both in love with the premodern and specifically not in love with many aspects of modernism. So were their predecessors like Dunsany and George Macdonald. Saruman, to take one example, shows his evil nature by chopping down trees, building machinery and polluting the environment.<br><br>To me, one of the key dividing lines between fantasy and science fiction is this: Fantasy works in premodern terms, and science fiction in modern terms (which may look like emotional vs rational, but it's more than that). Of course, there are genre-breakers like Le Guin who go far beyond those categories - which is wonderful. But one mark, to me, of poorly written fantasy is that it approaches fantasy tropes with a modernist mindset.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>I could write a long rant about this... I may have, already. I've noticed for a long while that SF movies often have an anti-science bias. I think it may have less to do with the distinctions between fantasy and SF than the fact that most people in the movie business probably lean more towards the Romantics than to the Age of Enlightenment.</p>
<p>In keeping with the breadth of the genre, however, I'd like to add that swords &amp; sorcery seems to lean more towards the SF side of things, or at least towards a pragmatic, simplified past, in contrast to Tolkein and Lewis's romanticized past. This may explain why Michael Moorcock gets pretty critical of Tolkein and Lewis in his "Epic Pooh" essay:</p>

<p>There might not be much difference between the two, other than one tends to be optimistic while the other tends to be pessimistic. I've seen Ken Hite refer to Horror as being a fundamentally conservative genre, too; the difference is that the horror writer is terrified at the loss of "the good old days", either because of the encroachment of the modern or because of revelations that spoil the innocence of times long past.</p>

                            Fantasy covers a lot of ground, but my sense of it is that viewing it as "just" speculative fiction whose premise is "what if magic were real" misses the point. I can't help but inject my personal judgment though when I admit that a lot of so-called fantasy is just that--science fiction with magic.<br><br>I came to this realization during a conversation with John Morrow on my LJ, which drifted into the old controversy over <a href="http://ewilen.livejournal.com/25780.html?thread=121524#t121524" rel="nofollow">what to do with the orc children, now that we've killed their parents?</a> I draw the line at the idea of a fantasy world where the "absolute evil" of orcs is represented as a biologically inborn trait, rather than the product of a fantastic moral cosmology. The former is a kind of science fiction--<i>Aliens</i>, basically--the latter, fantasy. Elsewhere in the mix are swords &amp; sorcery (an amoral but anthropocentric universe with magical trappings) and actual myth, which is similar in spite of the portrayals of actual gods &amp; goddesses (at least in Greek myth).<br><br>I'm sure there are plenty of ways to break things down. Let me suggest, though, a reason for distinguishing the category I've identified as "science fiction with magic" from "swords &amp; sorcery". The difference is that "science fiction" is about the themes that arise from scientific speculation. Thus, "if economic inequality grows and organ transplants are perfected, will society begin finding more and more ways to take people's organs for the benefit of the rich?" (subject of a couple Larry Niven stories). "Swords &amp; sorcery" on the other hand is about more basic stuff. The "technology" is essential to SF (even if it's magical technology); in S&amp;S or "planetary romance", the technology is secondary.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            To my mind fantasy is just a matter of "let's decide exactly what is true to enable X", where X is a story, or a theme, or even an aesthetic.  That's what's useful about it; you're unconstrained by mere <i>facts</i>.  What purpose you put this freedom to is another matter.  There's some amount of this in any fiction - you always have to create characters and events that didn't happen - but the label "fantasy" indicates a sweeping "fuck you" to reality for whatever reason.  It's a "yes, yes I <i>know</i> that that's not how things really work.  You are very clever.  Now shut up and work with me here, ok?"<br><br>And the problem there, as with all sufficiently broad ideas, is that it's bloody difficult to say much useful about it.  Or at least I do.  I mean, we've (as in writers and other people who aren't me) have gotten into certain habits about what's "safe" and accepted under the fantasy header, and what things people don't like reading about in a real world setting and may require a radically different context to enjoy.  But I'm not sure if that says anything <i>about</i> fantasy other than to serve as examples of how it can be used.  It seems better to work backwards from the elements/themes/feelings you want and try to work out the conventions for signposting them or techniques to evoke them<br><br/>As to the dichotomy of sci-fi vs fantasy - I'm not sure it's a useful idea.  There's obviously a blurry border between them at the best of times, but I think that there being a border <i>at all</i> is mostly out of habbit.   I suspect that all the easy things to point to re: sci-fi/fantasyness (rationalist worldview vs absolute morality, explained vs unexplained, robots vs dragons, whatever) are more force of habit than anything else.  Hell, may as well lump in superhero comics while we're at it.  The tropes have enough traction that they're useful telegraphing stuff to the reader (Oh, I get it, it's <i>magic</i>.  Now I know where I stand) but I don't see anything <i>fundamental</i> about any of them.  <br/><br/>Fantasy is just <i>so</i> open an idea that unless you constrictively redefining it there will always a counterexample to any specific answer to "what makes fantasy fantasy"?<br/><br/>Sorry - that was kind of a non-answer.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
While we're tossing around guys like Gandalf and Aslan, let's not forget Merlin and Prospero.  Both predate Tolkien and Lewis and did magic with spells and spell-like abilities.  In fact, Prospero even had a spell book (which was brought up in one of the most famous scenes of the play).  I would hold them up as having magic more akin to modern RPGs, though with some notable differences I will admit.<br/>

Peace,<br/>

                            We have to talk about the difference between fantasy and fantasy pastiche, because they're different genres and there are people who like one and not the other.<br/><br/>Here's my stab at fantasy: Fantasy stories are stories where the internal conflicts of a human spirit are rendered as immediate, external, and often elemental forces in the world, usually in the form of non-existent/mythical people, places, and things.  (Yeah, this covers a few other things, like myths.  Fairy-tales are seperate, curiously.)<br/><br/>Here's my stab at fantasy pastiche: A story which, while using the same non-existent/mythical traippings of fantasy, does not render the internal conflcits of the human spirit as immediate, external forces in the world.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            I think in the end, Tim, unless you want a wishy-washy fantasy definition that is unclear and will confuse, you should probably stick to something like;<br/><br/><b>A lot of people have ideas about what Fantasy is. But for the course of this game, we will be focusing on the following "Fantastic Elements": Make sure you manipulate these to fullest effect when running a game of 'In a Land Called' .(yadda yadda yadda)</b><br/><br/>Star Frontiers and Shock: are both SF games. Neither defines what ALL of SF is for the purposes of playing the game. But both do a good job of explaining WHICH SF elements you'll be finding and playing with in THIS game.<br/><br/>So, I dunno how far you'll be getting in your design, or providing helpful player adivce, but taking on this mountainous task. Rather it's probably best to just get clear about what you want the game to do, and spend a lot of careful time describing just those elements.<br/><br/>Probably doesn't help too much, but "What Makes Fantasy" is probably too deep for its own good. "What IS Love?" etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>I preface this with a gigantotronic disclaimer: I don't know much about Fantasy as a genre. I've read a wad of Conan stories, I read a couple of Earthsea books and The Once and Future King as a kid, I've read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, and I've read Beowulf. I think I read a Pern novel as a lad, as well. Uh, I've seen Star Wars lots of times and, I dunno, Beastmaster and the like when my friend. So those are the knives I've brought to this gunfight.</p>
<p>What I see in those stories has been largely said by Brand and Ben, but I'd like to point out the elephant in the room: they're about the protagonist's life. Science Fiction, by contrast, tends to be about the society.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p><em>Lord of the Rings</em> has all these societies: the Rohirim, Gondor, the Shire, the Sylvan and Grey Elves, the dwarves under the mountain, Mordor, the Easterlings, and the Southrons. And what the story's really about is Frodo stepping up to the plate while Aragorn takes his thrown.</p>
<p><em>Schismatrix</em> (an old Bruce Sterling anthology that's really fun reading) has these two philosophical parties: the Shapers and the Mechanists. Between them is a freelance dealmaker who has Prana-Bindu-like powers of body reading. He goes from clade to clade, cutting deals between interested parties â€” pheremonally communicating insects, masters and slaves, that kind of thing. But even though the book follows this dude around, it's about the societies he encounters.</p>
<p>For Tolkein, the society is there to highlight the personal struggle.</p>
<p>For Sterling, the protagonist is there to highlight the societal critique.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>Isnt that more covering up the issue than solving it?</blockquote>
Er, well, yes and no.  I think it's basically come into vogue to call it "speculative fiction" or "spec fic" because people have realized that in terms of publishing and genre categories, trying to differentiate between "fantasy" and "science fiction" is a pretty much impossible and thankless task.  There will always be people who bitch that the novel that won the Hugo was REALLY fantasy, not science fiction (the Hugo's officially for both, but has historically been biased toward science fiction), and who will cheerfully draw distinctions between the two genres that'll be immediately shot down by someone else.  <br/><br/>Which is not to say it's not an interesting exercise to try to figure out just what it is that makes something feel more like science fiction, or more like fantasy.  To go on a tangent...  I tend to personally and subjectively find that China Mieville's works (specifically <i>Perdido Street Station</i>, <i>The Scar</i>, and <i>Iron Council</i>) have a sort of science-fictional aura to them despite the obvious fantasy setting and elements.  I haven't been able to put my finger on why; I think it's the combination of the dystopian nature of the works, and the conceit that in his world, magic is studied and experimented with the way science is studied in our world.                        </div>

                            What I realize I wanted out of this thread was not just a strict definition, but also some dicussion on how we, as players, designers, &amp; authors, can make genuine fantasy and not just fantasy pastiche. To this end, Ben's thoughts seem to about the same as mine.<br/><br/>Something else to consider is that much of what we consider fantasy either *is* myth, or is a direct descentent of myth. So some discussion of myth, I think, willl shed some light on this topic. (I think this is where the moralistic element plays into things.) I will admit a very close connection of myth &amp; "fantasy" in my own thinking.<br/><br/>I bet we could discuss some common themes in fantasy, but due to the vagueries of genre, we won't be able to make any absolute statements.<br/><br/>Some of the discussion of fantasy vs SciFi has been helpful, as far as it has shed light on fantasy (emotional, pre-rational/scientific, pre-modern). Joshua's comments on society in fantasy &amp; scifi is definitely worth thinking, though it's probably beyond my ability to make definitive statements about that.<br/><br/>Curly &amp; Thomas both made some good thought-provoking. I'll have to think about that stuff some.<br/><br/>I'm chewing on this thread. I think some good stuff has been said. But here are some issues that have come up:<br/><br/>--If fantasy involves pre-rational/scientific/modern assumptions, how do we incorporate some of that into stories/designs/play?<br/><br/>--What about the role of society (vs the individual) in fantasy?<br/><br/>--Does fantasy have to be "about" magic somehow?<br/><br/>--What about the moral issue--is this something inherent to fantasy? Or does that just play into a subset of fantasy?                        </div>

Nor studded leather, pointy ears, magic, or bad prose. <br/><br/>I am winnar.                        </div>

                            Tim, <br/><br/>To try and drag myself kicking and screaming back towards being helpful, I do have a couple of thoughts about some of those questions. <br/><br/>For how we make pre-rational/scientific/modern assumptions, I think Heroquest offers one solid model here. In HQ all magic is tied to religion, and belief and magic go hand in hand in a powerful way. (A similar, though less complete system can be seen in 4th Edition Pendragon.) Combine that with Glorantha's semi-consensual reality (where the consent of the gods mediates direct human consent issues like those from Mage) and you get a world that is mythic in a powerful sense, as what everyone believes is both true and false, and magic is always subjective and prone to change. <br/><br/>I'd also note that this is one of the areas where lots and lots of folks have real, serious problems with HeroQuest. Many of us are so very used to thinking about our modern and post-modern rationalistic thought as "the way people think" that breaking out of that paradigm can be difficult. Heroquest, I feel, has often stumbled in giving guidance in this area because of the scattered nature of the Gloranthan setting material where Artesia did a better job of portraying it in the setting material, but then lacked a system that backed it up as powerfully. (Artesia's system is good, but tends to be a bit too directly explanatory where Heroquest allows for relativism to some degree.) <br/><br/>As for the role of the society vis a vie the individual... that's a big one, and not easy to sum up. The Lord of the Rings shows a different slant on it than does a Wizard of Earth Sea and both are radically different than Conan. The one constant that I do see is that the individual vs the group in fantasy is almost always a sharply drawn contrast, where in the author puts forward their views on the nature of the individuals relationship to the collective from the perspective of the individual. So Conan is against civilization in a real way, as Howard saw the collective as being something that makes men weak and corrupt. In Lord of the Rings the good individuals must step forward to lead the good, but undirected, people -- often at great cost to the individual. In Wizard of Earthsea, OTOH, the individual has to learn to subsume his interests to those of the group and to rely on their help and friendship to overcome his own issues. <br/><br/>I don't know that fantasy has to be about magic, but the mythic tones of fantasy seem to ensure that it will have some element, at least, of what Mike called "the embedded meaning of the universe." Of course, it is worth noting that in some fantasy this embedded meaning is "madness and violence will overtake everything" -- as seen in Howard's work. The embeded meaning will be there, and will often resonate at an emotional or atavistic level, but that doesn't mean it has to be a good meaning, and it doesn't always have to be directly displayed in "magical" terms. <br/><br/>Of course, I suppose this all depends on the definition of magic we're using, doesn't it? Are the Arthurian Romances about magic? <br/><br/>And finally, in so much as fantasy worlds are something that have an embedded meaning, there is going to be some kind of moral stance involved. Myth and legend are powerful tools of meaning and morality generation, and even their bastard degenerate child of fantasy is going to share in that to some degree.                        </div>

<br/>
It's less a 'how to draw' book, than a 'what to draw'-- to achieve Fantasy.<br/>
Or even a 'why to draw' in a Fantasy vein.<br/>
<br/>
The hero stands with a wide stance.  The villain is crooked.  Even the trees in his forest are crooked and leafless.<br/>
"In fantasy, ordinary things-- such as Cinderella's shoe-- have extraordinary significance."<br/>
<br/>
The book reads like notes from a Disney animator's master class.<br/>
Subsequently, much of the material is concerned with keeping story components attached to<br/>
rich Fantasy justifications, instead of empty pastiche.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth flipping thru.  The illustrations make their points very directly.<br/>
The words are just pointers to draw your attention to the techniques offered.                        </div>

<p>Another Michael Moorcock link, this time somewhat relevant to the issue of individualism in the context of fantasy and science fiction:</p>
<p><a href="http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/moorcock.html" rel="nofollow">Starship Stormtroopers</a></p>
<p>Moorcock doesn't agree that all science fiction is about society, in contrast to fantasy; in fact, he argues that the vast bulk of science fiction, like fantasy (and in contrast to his personal tastes,) uses individualism as a more acceptable form of bening paternalism. I'm not sure I agree with all his views, but he offers some food for thought.</p>
<p>I found that link via another essay, this one about why science fiction is dying as a genre and why going back to the pulps is not a solution:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2006/10/lets_put_the_future_behind_us.html" rel="nofollow">Let's Put The Future Behind Us</a></p>
<p>It's relevant mainly in that it shows that science fiction writers don't necessarily agree on what defines the genre, either, plus it points out some facts about the history of SF that aren't readily apparent.</p>

                            Yeah, I think that those thematic elements, individial vs. society, internal vs external, all are susceptible to counter-examples. I think that Dune, for example, is both about individual and societal conflicts, and even about the interaction between the two - I think that's it's brilliance. Oh, and I'm not sure if it's sci-fi or fantasy, either.<br/>
<br/>
OK, it's sci-fi, but very mystical sci-fi. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Mystical is not Mythical, by the way. For purposes of these discussions.<br/>
<br/>
I think that Brand's on target. The issue of magic, actually, is confused by the fact that in a pre-rational society viewpoint there is no magic at all. Magic, as a concept, always means "something that doesn't behave by the normal laws of the universe" or something like that. But in a pre-rational mindset, the fact that things work by what we'd call "supernatural" agents is how everything works. "Magic" is not an exception, but how everything works.<br/>
<br/>
Or, rather, again, there's no impersonal description of the universe existing outside of laws that bound it outside of magic. No physics. Things fall because that's the way somebody made the world. Not because of gravity.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, epistemologically there's really no difference between our POV and that of the pre-rational mindset. Meaning that gravity is a good description of how the universe works, but it still doesn't at all tell us why gravity exists. We still either have to discover it's meaning, or assume it has none.<br/>
<br/>
So when Brand says that Hero Quest links magic to religion, I always bristle a bit (this isn't the first time we've been through this). I'd say that it's more accurate to say that magic is the belief of the characters in HQ, and that these beliefs have mechanical weight. As I always point out, there are lots of atheistic beliefs in Glorantha, and that some of them specifically lead to magic abilities. For instance, "Sorcerers" wield the same sort of magic as other sorts of Adepts and Wizards." The difference between the two is one of what they believe - Sorcerers believe that the essence that they manipulate is an impersonal force, and the others believe that it's given by a monotheistic God (or even by other beings), and that when they die God will send the Sorcerers to hell for abusing his essence.<br/>
<br/>
Brand knows this objection, BTW, and doesn't really disagree if I'm not mistaken. So this isn't aimed at him, but at most everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
What's important is not the relativity which Brand notes (though that's interesting). Instead it's that the effects that we call magic are produced by the character's beliefs in how the world works, and to the characters this is just a normal manipulation of their world. Well, normal is an overstatement. It's just not an exception to some set of laws. It's abnormal in that in looking at their "magic" we focus on what we'd see as magical, and what the characters see as extraordinary results of their beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
That is, the character believes that his breathing is "magical," too. But he also knows that the ritual he knows to steal your breath is "special" in that it can only be done by appealing to that "intelligent design" of the universe. You breathe "naturally" in that nobody teaches you. But you learn to steal breath by, say, finding a spirit that'll do it for you. Or by emulating a god that did it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, in both of these cases you know that you can steal the breath this way because of some story that somebody told - a myth - that explains how it can be done. But, then again, there's a similar story that explains why you can breathe "naturally."<br/>
<br/>
HQ is remarkable in that it attempts to do this, as Brand says, without indicating that any one belief system is correct. They all are to the extent that they all work, and the characters are left to puzzle this out. That's not the subject of this thread, so I don't want to debate it here (if you want to talk about this phenomenon, then we can discuss it in a different thread). But the key is that the system enables character beliefs to have actual physical manifestations.<br/>
<br/>
That's fantasy - where we assume, unlike the modern (or post-modern) mindsets, that these beliefs are what make everthing happen. Meaning that what <i>we'd</i> call magic can happen.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that there's anything else common to fantasy, truth be told. Like most genres you can create most any theme. It's just about the color, really. Looking at the above essays, Moorcock would say that there's nothing similar between his works and Tolkien's thematically...but he'd still say that they're both fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As was said above, I think that it's less important to think about what fantasy as a genre means, than to think about what you want your game to be about. If all you have is that it's "fantasy," I think that you'd have to agree that this is going to leave it pretty darn broad. Which is fine, if that's what you want. But trying to say it's about fantasy, and then hoping that this narrows down what the game is about is both impractical, and doing design in reverse.<br/>

                            PS. In Sci-fi, even if we don't know how something works, there's always an assumption that there's an explanation for how it works that has to do with physics. Even the characters may not understand how something works - but the key is that they don't think that it's to do with some mythic underpinning of the universe. They believe that there's a rational explanation for the phenomenon, and that somebody will probably find it some day.<br/>
<br/>
Note Midichlorians in Star Wars. I think that some people groan at this simply because something that had formerly seemed mythic and fantastic suddenly was seen to be simply sci-fi. Since I like sci-fi, and always thought of Star Wars as Sci-fi, I don't have any trouble with the darn midichlorians (though even I'd admit that bringing them in half-way is jarring).                        </div>

                            Actually my objection to midichlorians is not disruption of the fantasy, but a worse thing: I hate it when SF tries to justify one of it's assumptions with bad science. I'd rather, for example, an SF story to just assume FTL travel exists, perhaps with enough techno-mumbo-jumbo to satisfy necessary plot, without trying to explain why it works when all we know from current science is that it doesn't work.<br><br>In other words, when speculative fiction is presenting a speculation, I want to just accept the speculation as a given, and read a good story based on that speculation, not some attempt to justify the speculation.<br><br>Frank                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think it's important to look at the pre-modern roots of fantasy. <br><br>Folks already mentioned myth and works like The Tempest and Midsummer Night's Dream, which points back to traditions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoral" rel="nofollow">pastoral literature</a>, which inspired the Italian comedic traditions in theatre, poetry, and opera (which inspired Shakespeare).  <br><br>For early sword &amp; sorcery you have to look to the Norse sagas and eddas, plus the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungenlied" rel="nofollow">Nibelungenlied</a>. Siegfried, baby!<br><br>Fantasy, in my mind, draws on myths so old that they are no longer especially potent. They have become stories. Fantasy is based on the cultural traditions of ancestral peoples who no longer exist, but their traditions are still entertaining because they tap into universal, archetypical themes. So fantasy is like myth, but without the current relevance. Fantasy doesn't tell you who you are as a people, or where you come from.  Fantasy is about someone else.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>I take it you would? I don't remember it that clearly â€” I read the Inferno when I was 12. My memory is that Virgil is pretty much just a vehicle, an everyman. He's there to be shocked and disgusted, but isn't engaged in any sort of struggle at all.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JonathanWalton</cite>So fantasy is like myth, but without the current relevance. Fantasy doesn't tell you who you are as a people, or where you come from.  Fantasy is about someone else.</blockquote>
<br>o rly?  I think you're wrong. The original Earthsea trilogy had a profound effect on me as a person when I first read them, and still do upon rereading.  Each of the three books deals with themes which are hugely relevant to us as modern humans, and are most definitely about us as people.  Growing up and taking responsibility for the damage you've done, embracing your dark side. Overcoming control, oppression and fear, breaking with tradition and finding your own way in the world. Thats all stuff we all have to deal with at some point.  Particularly "The Farthest Shore",  which is about confronting fear of death, fear of mortality and loss of power in a way I haven't seen anywhere else really.<br><br>Having said that, generally I'd agree that most fantasy doesn't tell the reader much about themselves.  But that's because most stuff written as Fantasy is mostly just fluff.  "Entertainments" as Graham Greene would put it.  But I don't think its inherent to the genre.   It doesn't mean that someone can't write something in that genre which isn't insightful and relevant.<br><br>Anyway, that's what I think.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

This, for the record, is the difference between a work of myth telling you who you are as a people and a work of literature giving you insight into yourself as a person. Earthsea effected you, but it hasn't told Americans as a whole who they are. That myth would be the State of the Union address.<br><br>So Jonathan is right about that bit. However, I think that he's wrong if he's claiming that fantasy doesn't inform people about their individual plights, beliefs, and situations in a metaphoric way. But then, I'm not thinking he was claiming that,so....                        </br></br></div>

                            What Brand said. All stories can inform us, but we know that, as fiction, the truths that are in stories are to be taken with a grain of salt.<br/>
<br/>
Myths, OTOH, are to be taken as literal truth about the nature of reality. When I grew up in the Catholic church, the myth of Christ and Transubstantiation was not taught as a "story," but an ongoing reality of life. It wasn't even a relation of some historical event, but an explaining of how things work right here and right now.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody believes that Iluvatar, the creator of Middle-Earth, created our world, or takes any action that would reflect such belief. Oh, sure, you might believe in the sanctity of a bucolic home after reading LotR, but you don't do so because you believe in the reality of the mythology. As opposed to, say, a radical Moslem who blows himself up because he believes he has a bevy of virgins waiting for him in the afterlife if he does so. Very different things, from that POV. The very word fantasy has a meaning like, "something not real." Myth, to the people who believe in them, is real.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that Myth is our western term for what we see as stories, because we don't believe these explanations of why the world is the way it is. To the societies that relate these events, they're telling what we would call "facts."<br/>

<p>To be really anal: fantasy is a literary form, myth is potential content for that form, or for other literary forms. The story of Cupid and Psyche is a myth; Ovid's <em>Metamorphoses</em> and C. S. Lewis's <em>Til We Have Faces</em> are literary tellings of that myth.</p>
<p>I don't quite agree with Jonathan's assessment of fantasy, but then, he's not defining fantasy, but describing how it's influenced him. For him, fantasy is re-using the myths of alien or long-dead cultures as content in a modern story, transforming what used to be an object of cultural relevance into an object of personal relevance.</p>
<p>I disagree in that I can think of many fantasy stories that don't use myths, even in the broader sense that includes legends, fairy tales, and folk tales. Is <em>The Cat In The Hat</em> or <em>The Phantom Toll-Booth</em> based on myth? <em>Alice In Wonderland</em> has a few borrowings from fairy tales and legends, but is that what makes it fantasy? And really, can you imagine a writer sitting down and saying, "Now, how can I write a story that isn't culturally relevant to my people as a whole?"</p>
<p>To me, the mark of fantasy is that, instead of relying solely on shared perceptions, it takes the author's unique, personal perceptions and mental links and weaves them into a story that can have relevance to others. It's Tolkein taking years of work making up imaginary languages and personal myths and converting them into a story we can read and take something away from. It's Lovecraft dredging up dreams and childhood fantasies about cats and things under the bed and irrational fears of strangers, combining them with myths and legends he read as a child, and creating <em>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</em>. It's Robert Asprin watching a bunch of Hope and Crosby "Road" pictures and imagining them as an incompetent boy and his demon sidekick. It's Stephen King wanting to do something really different with Westerns and coming up with The Gunslinger.</p>

                            I think one of the things which makes Neil Gaiman's fantasy so powerful is that he draws on myths that we know and that still have some resonance with us. Or at least they do when he's finished with them. He links them back to their deep psychological roots, or something.<br><br>Interesting to think that fantasy tends to be about the individual rather than the society when the premodern world priveleged the society above the individual, and science fiction vice versa when vice versa. I'm sure there's some significance in there.                        </br></br></div>

                            Brand's reading me correctly.  I'm not saying that works of fiction don't have emotion empact. I'm saying they don't serve as the shared cultural medium that makes society function.<br><br>I guess I'm talking about authorial intent and approach, which is something different than what other people are getting at.  Ben's right in that the content appears very similar at first, but that's not what I'm interested in.<br><br>When telling myth, a storyteller is instantiating a recieved narrative tradition and, in doing so, is also commenting on it or casting it in a different light or challenging established interpretations.<br><br>When telling fantasy, a storyteller is taking all the internalized stories that they've ever been told (myths, fantasies, and everything else) and making their own personal creative expression based on those foundations.  It can also comment on or challenge cultural norms, but it is not a refashioning of an existing tradition.  You are not retelling The Stories Of Your People.  You are telling a new story that draws on those stories and other elements.<br/><br/>It complicates matters when people do both at the same time, but I kinda like my division for now.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Tolkien was an English professor and wrote a short poetics for fantasy calle On Fairy Stories, usually found in the collection Tree and Leaf. Don't worry about the use of Faerie, Tolkien tries reclaim in from diminuitive beings in children's stories. It would be crass to summarize it but Tolkein's essential charecteristics are the creation of a Secondary World which is internally consistent and in which we can have Secondary Belief. For Tolkein the purpose of Fantasy is Recovery (in the sense of re-seeing or seeing things anew much like Formalism's notion de-familiarization), Escape (for Tolkien this seems to be implicity escape as a rejection of the  industrial world, the humdrum of life) and Consolation (for Tolkien Tragedy is the highest form of Drama but Joy is the highest form of Fantasy).<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting stuff, thoughI suspect not a poetics that applies as easily to Sword and Sorcery as to Heroic Fantasy (apart from Escape which I think is an important dimension to all pulp-fiction). <br/>
<br/>
Tolkein rejects poetics based on drama as valid for fantasy because "you are apt to misunderstand pure story-making, and to constrain it to the limitations of stage plays. You are, for instance, likely to prefer characters, even the basest and the dullest, to things. Very little about trees as trees can be got into a play."<br/>
<br/>
I take it Tolkein's creative agenda at the table would have been sim not narr ;-)                        </div>

                            Then there's fantasy in the sexual sense.  With its many media: song lyrics, fashion, porn.<br/>
<br/>
Sexual fantasy has it's open-ended 'anything's possible' side.  Carefree naked gallavanting in the wilds.<br/>
Versus a side that tries to capture, define, specify, control.  Ritualized power relationships and fetishized signifiers. 'Role-play'.<br/>
<br/>
The techniques of sexual fantasy also apply to other human desires, which may be the definition of Fantasy overall...<br/>
...a set of symbolic techniques that both liberate and constrain thinking about desires.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(And, regarding whether Science Fiction is a subset of Fantasy, I would argue that SF's decades-long preoccupation with<br/>
distinguishing itself from Fantasy; is circumstantial evidence that SF is on the 'constrain' end of the spectrum.  SF wants<br/>
to fantasize elaborately, to 'speculate', but it's wary of losing SAN.)                        </div>
