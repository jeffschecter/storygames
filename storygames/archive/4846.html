MYTHIC RUSSIA SPECIAL OFFER<br/>\n<br/>\nFather Frost visits good children bringing gifts of cheer and wonder. To celebrate the imminence of the first in the Birchbark Chronicle range of Mythic Russia supplements, I have set aside a box of Mythic Russia softcovers to be sold at a special discount rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nUK: GBP 20, including p&amp;p<br/>\n<br/>\nEurope: Euro 28, including free surface shipping (typically takes 2-3 weeks), or + euro 4 to upgrade to airmail<br/>\n<br/>\nUSA/Canada: USD 40, including free surface shipping (typically takes 6 weeks), or + USD 5 to upgrade to airmail (not as much of a discount as I'd like, but blame the exchange rate\u2026)<br/>\n<br/>\nRest of world: ask for details<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to order: Go to http://www.firebird-productions.com/ordering.htm for details.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a limited offer: once that box is empty, it is empty, so order now!<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE BIRCHBARK CHRONICLES<br/>\n<br/>\nThese supplements to Mythic Russia will explore the stories and cultures of the world in more detail, with new keywords, narrator heroes, scenarios, story seeds and background essays.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first, BBC1 \u2013 The Golden Horde, looks at the nomads of the east. The centre-piece is a rich treatment of the Bashkorts by Simon Phipp, a semi-nomadic subject people of the Mongols with their own traditions, spirit pantheon and place in the unfolding story of the world of Mythic Russia. The issue also includes further details on the peoples of the Golden Horde and the cities of the steppe, a scenario, story seeds and narrator characters from various tribes of the Horde. It will be available through Lulu.com as a PDF or printed book; I hope it will be out before Christmas but will let you know as soon as possible. The best way to keep up to date on progress is to join the newslist @ http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Mythic_Russia/<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, all that said, I'd be interested in views on how much background -- especially historical information -- is necessary/helpful/downright problematic. I'm an historian by trade and training, but don't see RPGs as textbooks, and try (others can assess the success) to keep the history in games accessible and confined to what really does help play. When moving into supplements, though, there is a question in my mind as to how far to go, especially because prospective contributors are proving often much more keen on historically-derived info-dumps with some story plothooks than, say, a scenario or a really interesting NPC whose story and actions illuminate the historican context in a 'show don't tell' way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I being over-concerned? Would people be quite happy with lots of extra historical background from which they can pick and choose? Or would this begin to deaden the game, turn it from being a fun exercise in consensual fantasy into glorified homework? Given that I am beginning to sketch out what I want to see in the next issues of the BBC, I'd be grateful for opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best<br/>\n<br/>\nMark                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108727/#Comment_108727" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-18T07:25:16+00:00" title="November 18, 2007  7:25AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It really depends on the kind of play style and experience you're going for.<br/><br/>Personally, I like to make shit up during the game. I want to have evocative details and a general backdrop, but I never want to be in a position where I'm going to have to say, "So last session I said that the ruling group in the fourteenth dynasty was the Umar Council, but actually that dynasty had a king, and so we need to redo this and that because your plans hinged on evoking the glory of the old democratic days." Or something.<br/><br/>That said, I know plenty of people who want to have enough details to feel like the fictional world exists outside of them and their characters. They DO want to have to memorize stuff, and the possibility of being wrong, because it then means something when you get it right. Plus it feels more authentic.<br/><br/>So really, it all depends on what you're going for there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108730/#Comment_108730" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-18T08:39:13+00:00" title="November 18, 2007  8:39AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2007 8:39AM by JDCorley.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like one million details, and also making things up during the game.
