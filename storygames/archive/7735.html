Bring in refreshment scenes from Solar System.  <br/><br/>Basically, let things brew with a scene that has no die rolling, and increase one die by one size.  Have a hard limit of stats can't add up to more than 48, and no more than one twelve-sider.<br/><br/>The only thing I'm having a hard time with is defining which kind of things would line up to which dice get refreshed.  So far I'm thinking:<br/><br/>Covertly ... Observe events without being involved<br/>Directly ... Tell someone exactly how it is / declare your intentions.<br/>For Others ... Take care of someone<br/>For myself ... Enjoy your gains<br/>With Love ... Connect emotionally with someone<br/>With Violence ... Deal with / receive / inflict pain outside of conflict                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171742/#Comment_171742" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T08:49:29+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  8:49AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For myself... could also be "let someone take care of you".<br/><br/>For the die size limits, I would just say: "only up to the die size you started with".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171744/#Comment_171744" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T09:19:12+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  9:19AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this could be a neat idea but I think it has potential to really remove the negotiating with a big stick aspect of exhausting or injuring someone.<br/><br/>I would use the above proposed rules but only allow each character to have a refreshment scene once per chapter.  This way negotiation is only very slightly skewed (only one of the two stats lost would "heal") and the player would have to choose wisely when to use it.  Additionally, it would still ensure that the session went by quick and was not bogged down with refreshment scenes between EVERY conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171769/#Comment_171769" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T13:07:08+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  1:07PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that this could be tried as a way to "heal damaged dice".<br/><br/>However unless something else is tweaked, these "less intense scenes" result in "inflation" don't they?<br/><br/>Characters progress faster relative to the amount of conflict they are caught up in.<br/><br/>Is that accepted/intended?<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
