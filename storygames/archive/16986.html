I really don't know what happened there. I'm glad you dug up the website version. That was going the extra mile!)<br/><br/>After listening to the playtest, it's obvious that even the draft on my website still needs a lot of work, but I honestly had no idea what direction to go until you guys tried it out! This is some of the best feedback I've gotten on any of my games for years. (I've also decided against a career in technical writing, but that was a foregone conclusion.)<br/><br/>If any design is going to work, it has to be clear to people who have never played before and are, perhaps, even, somewhat reluctant to play. Clarity is of the essence and, quite frankly, I was shocked to discover how many areas of explanation I'd overlooked (and how many really obvious things I'd over-emphasized.)<br/><br/>Hopefully, I'll have a better version of this game idea, soon, and, all I can say is, thanks again for your help!<br/>You guys are really dedicated, a Godsend to those of use who have no other sounding board.<br/><br/>I'd like to post a complimentary comment on your blog site... but how do I do that?<br/><br/>(By the way, if anyone wants a copy of the playtest, for any reason, nefarious or otherwise, please give them one or refer them to me, I'll send them the one I copied.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386339/#Comment_386339" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-03T19:31:17+00:00" title="August  3, 2012  7:31PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://momsbasementpodcast.blogspot.com/2012/08/episode-51-unwholesome-tenancy-gaming.html#comment-form" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://momsbasementpodcast.blogspot.com/2012/08/episode-51-unwholesome-tenancy-gaming.html#comment-form</a><br/><br/>That's the comment link for the blog post.

But I didn't want to get people in a Cthulhu frame of mind.<br/><br/>The goal of the game was to help players evolve their characters from seemingly worthless to persons of value by offering chances outside the artificial norm established by the beginning narration. It still needs some tweaking, I'd say, but I'm pleased with your responses to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/slliska" title="slliska"><img alt="slliska" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/631/nGS1XYKEZ7DB8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/slliska">slliska</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386424/#Comment_386424" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-05T21:58:41+00:00" title="August  5, 2012  9:58PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys did a really good job of play testing and reviewing "Unwholesome Tenancy", I really enjoyed listening to both podcasts.  It was great how you three talk about what works well, and what and how things can be improved.  <br/><br/>I tried to use my Wordpress ID to leave feedback and even though I was logged in, it kept stating that my OpenID could not be authenticated, so I had to switch to my never used Google account.  <br/><br/>I didn't really understand what "Unwholesome Tenancy" meant either, but if I had to guess I would have though it had something to do with the general population's disdain of the homeless and there seemed to be some kind of Cthulhu (or at least monsterish feel to the title.  I got to admit the idea of the desperation of hobos fighting monsters, is pretty darn cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
