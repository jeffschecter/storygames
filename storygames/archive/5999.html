I think they're completely wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone wouldn\u2019t be interested in playing any kind of more involved tabletop game or a parlour game that involves more active participation \u2014 they won\u2019t be interested in playing an RPG either.  It's not an RPG specific thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere might be social stigma attached to raising your hand in a staff meeting at work and suggesting an office D&amp;D; party\u2026 but there\u2019d also be stigma to suggesting an X-Box party, or a NASCAR party, or working on model railroads as an office.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone mentions that they like videogames, there\u2019s no problem talking about World of Warcraft, and unless they express a lot of scorn for MMORPGs, there\u2019s no reason not to bring up RPGs with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you\u2019re having a conversation with someone and they tell you they enjoy more involved boardgames or parlour games of any kind there\u2019s no issue with bringing up RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you\u2019re talking with someone about model railways, there\u2019s no issue in talking about tabletop wargames like Warhammer 40K \u2014 and from there, there\u2019s no issue to talking about RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's all about knowing the interests of the person you're talking to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Facebook makes this incredibly easy. You don\u2019t have to guess what people\u2019s hobbies are - - they list them on their profiles. Not only that, they add all these RPG type games and you get updates about which games your friends are playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 777, 000 users of the \u201cHarry Potter Magic Spells\u201d application (hey there\u2019s ANOTHER one of my friends who I could talk to about RPGs).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are over 8 *MILLION* people who\u2019ve installed the \u201cVampires\u201d application on Facebook. You have a vampire character who grows in power as you fight the other vampires of your friends. It\u2019s totally RPG inspired. Not to mention all the other applications with 100s of thousands to millions of players: Knights, Werewolves, Wizards, Armies, Zombies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny of your friends have that installed? Yup. Feel free to talk to them about RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's true that <i>some</i> RPGs have a steep learning curve (D&amp;D; 3.x I'm looking at you) but others don't at all.  Older versions of D&amp;D;, Risus, and any sort of rules-light, you say what you want to do and the DM interprets systems are easy for beginners to learn.  There are plenty of board games and even videogames that have comparable learning curves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the claim that people outside of the "gamer subculture" don't know about RPGs... the recent press coverage of Gary Gygax's passing away should dismiss those notions entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm posting this here because <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.chimera.info/2008/03/06/a-guy-who-made-a-game-the-end/#comment-2652" rel="nofollow">Matt felt replies to his blog posts weren't working well and a forum post would be better</a>.

I have never thought that this was at all important. I mean, forget your advice, Stuart, I have plenty of gamer friends already. I need more? Why? There's this implicit assumption that things would be somehow better if the gamer market were larger. I dunno, maybe we could make more money. But I doubt that this will ever happen. <br>\n<br>\nWhere I agree with Matt, what I thought his real point was, is that inside of gamer society, the one that exists now, we largely exist as a subculture that's somewhat toxic in general. And the gamer in-jokes are simply a symptom of the problem. The problem has to do more with the social assumptions that gamers make. Hey, we all speak the same gamer language, we're all compatible and friends! <br>\n<br>\nI could try to explain it better, but I think I'll let somebody else do the talking instead.

You're basically saying to a group of people who are X that think of themselves as part of a subculture called X.  They thought of you as a member of X.  Me and my friends are X.  From someone on the other side, it's easy to interpret that as you saying that there might not be such a subculture X and even if there was you don't want to be part of it.  Replace 'X'  with 'Gay' instead of 'Gamers' and you can see where the initial negative reaction came from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134020/#Comment_134020" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T11:33:36+00:00" title="March 11, 2008 11:33AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, Ryan.

These terms might be used as a placeholders for other things, or refer to specific groups of people that we know locally.  All of that will vary from person to person.  It's a spectrum of all sorts of inter-related "do I want to hang out with this person" factors... and we'll all have different criteria. My idea of a "gamer geek" may be different from yours.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) There's nothing wrong with the games themselves.  They're no more "geeky" than many other popular hobbies.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  There's no social stigma to talking about RPGs with people who have similar interests:  boardgames, videogames, model building, sci-fi, fantasy, costuming, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\n4) There's not really any social stigma to talking about RPGs or having RPG type stuff around you the rest of the time.  I just noticed I have an autographed "Dungeon Majesty" poster in my office.  No loss of social status suffered. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\n5) You don't need to do anything to "un-geek the hobby".  There are tons of people out there who I'm sure you'd enjoy gaming with.  You just need to be outgoing, cheerful, and positive.*<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>* Which is the critique you're getting about trying to link "un-geeking the hobby" to a very uncheerful post on your blog...</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134036/#Comment_134036" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T12:09:41+00:00" title="March 11, 2008 12:09PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem is not how internal members of this subculture regard each other, it's how external society regards the subculture. It's easy to say, 'who cares what they think!' but societal pressures are real. For example, I'm a gamer, but I don't admit that to non-gamers unless I know them well. In some respects, that's my own issue, but I ain't hardly alone in feeling this way. Gaming isn't listed as a hobby on my Facebook profile.<br><br>Every group has its zealots, but not every group is judged by its zealots like this one is. Look at sports: if you meet someone who watches football, you might formulate some opinions, but I'd say for the most part, you don't immediately picture them in full body paint, screaming at the top of their lungs from the bleachers in the snow. When you tell a person that you're a gamer, I think that the image that your average person is going to hit on is something akin to the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons. Basically, despite being a somewhat normal, well-rounded fellow, if I told average joe that I was a gamer, I'd be judged according the worst geek in the world. If my Dad told the same average joe that he enjoyed watching hockey and baseball, it's unlikely that he'd be seen as remotely abnormal or judged poorly. <br><br>That's what we have to deal with. And for the record, Vampire applications on Facebook and WoW in no way are equated with gaming in most peoples' minds. They might be slightly dorky, but they don't actually involve role-playing, which is nebulous, weird and embarassingly immersive.<br><br>The worst of us are our representatives to the outside world, and I don't like them any more than those outside the hobby do. I don't know what to do about it. Things like comics and video games have shouldered past rpgs and acquired some legitimacy, but I don't know how this hobby can wash the perceived slime off, because it doesn't seem to have the power to grow in popularity outside some unforeseen cultural shift.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134041/#Comment_134041" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T12:16:38+00:00" title="March 11, 2008 12:16PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to think there would be all sorts of social fall out if people knew... the dark secret... that I played RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there isn't any.

Setup the GaryCon 2008 Facebook event -- let's all play some Dungeons &amp; Dragons!!!  Nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no social fallout from letting people know you play RPGs.

Offhandedly I mention Business Solutions.<br><br>"Hey guys," I say to a Taoist watercolor author and a professional caterer, "We could play this game my buddy Jason cooked up. We pretend to be slacker copy machine repairdudes and then try to ruin each other's lives. It's like The Office, only we can run it in the 80's and be stupid."<br><br>I get a resounding chorus of "Fuckin A" from these two would-be jocks, with no traditional roleplaying experience whatsoever.<br><br>So, I have no idea where the idea of playing make-believe being uncool stems from. I still can get together with a bunch of grown men, with kids, and play with toys. I'd compare it to something akin to being comfortable enough in one's sexuality to have an adult conversation about intercourse. Happens every day, and there's no stigma about bringing up something you enjoy to friends.<br><br>Now, I didn't say, "hey guys, wanna get fat on cheetoos, grow a huge neckbeard, and roll a bunch of dice?" To me, that's a different activity than playing a game and hanging out, and very presumptuous on the part of the speaker, not the listener. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134068/#Comment_134068" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T12:49:05+00:00" title="March 11, 2008 12:49PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>Sure you do, the answer is obvious and staring you right in the face: if you don't agree with the way others are representing your hobby to the outside world, <i>represent it yourself.</i> Don't hide your gaming hobby any more than you would your bowling hobby or your restoring vintage hot rods hobby or what have you.</blockquote>Ron, I wanna be like you when I grow up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134081/#Comment_134081" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T13:05:58+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  1:05PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarrod</cite>Ron, I wanna be like you when I grow up.</blockquote>\nStart by not growing up.

Matt is from Iowa. <br>\n<br>\nI say that half in jest. That is, it's a fact, and it shouldn't matter. But perhaps folks from Iowa handle this stuff differently that from your neck of the woods. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor my part, the most typical problem that I've had with talking to folks about RPGs is basic uncertainty. That is, the "normie" will sorta look at you askance not sure what to make out of your description of RPGs. Consider this, I once worked with a guy who was married to another co-worker. Star Wars: Phantom Menace came out, and he and I were psyched to go see it. So we went, and she came along to "see what you guys are so excited about." She had never seen any of the movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, hard to fathom, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we see the film, and we come out and she's got this look on her face. We ask her what she thought. Her comment, "You guys didn't tell me that it was animated. I mean, come on, that's kid stuff."<br/>\n<br/>\nSame person, when I described RPGs to her... well I have not gained her respect back since then. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine who I play Warhammer with got married a while ago, late in life. I met her, and the subject of an upcoming game came up. She says, "That's OK, you boys just go play with your little army men." Sure, said lovingly and jokingly, but also said in a demeaning tone that made it quite clear that, not only did she not understand why we did what we did, but that it was wrong for grown men to be participating in this activity. My friend has, bless his heart, not buckled under to her, but he has said that she does think that it's a complete waste of his time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI've used some examples of stuff that's not RPG, so you can, perhaps, get a perspective from the outside that might allow you some empathy with the person doing the criticizing. But these things happen with RPGs even more often than with science fiction or with even miniatures wargaming. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt least here in the Midwest that's my experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I care? Not one whit. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134112/#Comment_134112" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T14:07:27+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  2:07PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't listen to this friggin' Wisconsin-ite!  &lt;--- full in jest<br/><br/>Actually, Mike's giving some great examples how experiences can differ.

Sometimes, other people that I'm spending social time with <i>actually</i> (as opposed to just politely, which is ubiquitous) want me to explain this other shit a little or show it to them, because they're interested.  <br/><br/>I would like to have a few more really, really approachable games on hand for those occasions. Of equal, if not greater, importance, it's good to have a few friends that can "switch off" the geekery in order to meet someone like that at the table and not bore them mindless (I already have these).<br/><br/>But beyond that, on the wider scale, I'm not sure that I care.  I would feel all happy and warm and fuzzy and shit if more people had games and friends on hand like that, and got the same coolness out of that.

It's not like I've been tarred, feathered and run out of town, there's just a certain something you can see in someone's eye, something that says you've moved down a tick on their respect meter. Minor as that may seem, it's enough to make me hesitant. <br/><br/>And sure, I try to make things better. I ran a game of InSpectres for about ten non-gamer co-workers. They enjoyed it. I don't hide the illustrations I did for Grey Ranks, because I'm proud of them and think Jason's game is one of the best examples of what gaming can be.

I stopped going after GenCon '97 and can't imagine ever participating again without a sizeable financial incentive.<br/><br/>My primary play group is entirely ungeeky, and we've brought in several people who have played RPGs in their youth and then put them away when they hit their 20s and started getting preoccupied with things like jobs and girls. They went out, got a life, figured themselves out, and are now absolutely incredible participants in the best gaming of my life.<br/><br/>Sometimes my clients will notice some weird gaming chat on my Facebook page and I'll explain to them what I'm talking about. Then they shrug and move on. I get similar questions about mountain biking commentary on my Facebook page, as well as website development stuff. It's all just a semi-interesting blur. Really, everyone who's not you does not give a shit about you.<br/><br/>Mainstreaming game design might be of interest if you're trying to pay the bills, but I'm not at all convinced the fundamentals of the activity are ever going to be that interesting. The fundamentals of any activity are pretty uninteresting to those not bitten by that particular bug.<br/><br/>Is there still a stigma? Maybe, I guess. Anyone who stigmatizes me isn't going to be a client of mine, nor a friend, nor anyone I want to deal with, so it's a non-issue for me, personally. Finding new players is trivially easy, and doesn't involve posting up a notice at the FLGS. <br/><br/>Re your specific post, Matt: I'm getting where you're at, but I have to wonder why you give even the tiniest shit what the geek subculture(s) think of you now that you've left the subculture(s). Is it harming sales? When you're talking about "the gamer subculture" I assume you're talking the con scene, game shop-organized play groups, and online discussion fora.<br/><br/>It's an awfully big world out there and there are puh-lenty of people who dearly love this silly hobby of ours and do not participate in cons, game shop groups, or forums.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134144/#Comment_134144" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T15:08:36+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  3:08PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Paul. I think your random-ish comments are great. <br/><br/>I haven't "left" the subculture in that, yes, I sell books (not as a living, as some commenters assume; I don't pay a penny toward any "real" bills), and I do so at GenCon, for example. I have been questioning all of that, actually. I don't have an answer for it yet.<br/><br/>I actually don't really give a shit what the subculture thinks of me! I figured that'd be mostly obvious in that I posted something that was bound to piss members off. I don't have a vested interest in them <i>hating</i> me; I simply am basically indifferent.<br/><br/>My sales have not been harmed as far as I can tell at any point related to this issue. And, I seriously doubt they'll be harmed afterwards (after my blog post, that is), as well, even though a couple commenters insisted in reminding me they'll never buy books from such a jerk like me. It's kinda hard worrying about "losing" sales to people who never heard of me, let alone Dust Devils or Nine Worlds or 44.<br/><br/>The things you mention (cons, shops, forums) are indeed big parts of the things I'm talking about, yes. I don't frequent my local shop anymore. I attend GenCon specifically to make sales and meet old friends. I'm not really excited at stuff when I'm there, really. I increasingly find it not my thing. I have left many online forums I used to frequent. Obviously, I still participate some! They are, to my mind, very pleasant places to talk about the activity of RPGs. Sometimes more so than other times!<br/><br/>I agree with you, Paul. It is a big world, and there are plenty of fine folks to play with. My own regional selection is <i>slightly</i> slimmer pickings than many people's (just a smaller city and area is all), but I agree with you. That said, finding them, and broadening the appeal and awareness of the kinds of games I'm interested in creating and playing isn't easy as pie, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134146/#Comment_134146" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T15:21:05+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  3:21PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it's any comfort, Matt, I'm right there with you.

The regular gathering methods for like-minded players have either become distasteful or ineffective in delivering to me new people I care to play with.<br/><br/>Taking the time to post your perspective to your blog might not be seen as an indifferent act. I'm sure you can see why.<br/><br/>On a tangent related to your feelings on selling books @ GenCon: Didn't Uncle Ron package up Spione as something that wasn't "for" the gamer subculture? I'm not sure who other than those already aware of the Roninator will ever buy it, or be aware of it. Lulu's a destination site, not something you stumble into with a web search. Without regular participation in the "right" forums -- the ones where the discussions tend to collect around subjects you care about and avoid the ones you don't -- I'm not sure how you get the word out about a new game that's not "for" typical gamers.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134174/#Comment_134174" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T16:34:23+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  4:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't had a problem since I was 16 and got over what people I don't care about think about.<br/><br/>Of course I don't sell things to people, so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134195/#Comment_134195" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T16:58:27+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  4:58PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've told this story a few times, but it bears repeating:<br/><br/>I live in rural Japan.  There's not another English speaking "gamer" within several hundred miles of me.  But I have all the gaming I want.  That started as soon as I stopped thinking of people as "gamers" and "non-gamers" and started thinking of people who would enjoy playing this or that particular game.  When I bill a game as "a fun thing to try one time", it's much less intimidating than billing it as "this cultish hobby full of in-jokes and obscure rules".  <br/><br/>Which is not to say that I don't enjoy that part of it as well.<br/><br/>Can we have some kind of a continuum?  Like, I like some of the sense of belonging that comes from membership in a subculture, but I don't want to restrict my play to other members of that group, and I don't want to have to "induct" people in order to play with them.  Sometimes it's fun to really obsess over minutiae, to "geek out", so to speak, but I don't think it should be required as part of play.  I don't think it is.  I think the hobby's big enough to encompass all of that.  <br/><br/>I certainly feel the stigma of being a geek.  But I try not to.  I try to talk about it like I talk about any other part of my life.  I figure that the first step to removing that stigma is to not feel ashamed of it myself.  That's why I applaud what Matt's talking about.  He's saying that being proud of playing roleplaying games doesn't mean you have to embrace any other behaviour that you don't like.  I'd rather be a person than a gamer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134223/#Comment_134223" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T18:19:39+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  6:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Stuart, I never said poker.

The plan was that I'd go to my interview, then stop by the theatre, get our tickets and get in line (which we expected to be massive).  My wife, mom and dad would then meet me at the Theatre (all non dorks).  So I get there... and the place is empty.  All the crazy people had seen the midnight screening the night before.  I was there for the first evening screening on opening day.  I couldn't believe it -- I just walked up to the ticket booth, got the tickets... and walked over to the front of the line.  At one of the biggest theatres in Toronto.  Hey, pretty cool right?<br/>\n<br/>\nOMFG No.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the nerds showed up.  And these were nerds unlike any I've ever seen in my life.  Every horrible dork stereotype and many MANY new ones.  300 pound greasy men slappy fighting with small women.  Running shorts guy with some weird Dragon Rider t-shirts.  Getting out character sheets to "practice"... what?  I still don't know.  Yelling, squealing, nose-throat braying/laughing.  Shoving.  Tickle fighting.  (I'm sorry if this was anyone reading... but holy crap -- that's not how we act in public folks).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'm at the front of the line, in a shirt and tie, with a seething mass of nerdery bubbling and frothing behind me.  For at least *2 hours*.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was cool, because I let my parents be first in line to see the movie -- and seeing the first Star Wars with my Dad was one of the earliest movies I can remember going to see in the Theatre.  Too bad that !<a href="/forums/profile/%24">@$</a> Jar Jar showed up and wrecked it for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure where I was going with that...

But you're not doing you or your argument any favors. You could, for one moment, consider that our perceptions are actually correct, and what that means. <br>\n<br>\nIn fact, as I've tried to imply, it means nothing to me. The wife who didn't like Phantom Menace? We were never going to be good friends anyhow. The wife who thinks Warhammer is juvenile? It hasn't stopped her husband from participating. <br>\n<br>\nI agree with you that it's not a problem. But I agree with Matt that the phenomenon exists, no matter how little it's personally affected you. It's not a problem for me, because I don't need any of these people to play with. And, when I've needed to convert non-gamers into gamers (if you will), it's been easy. For every game-hater out there, there's somebody willing to learn. <br>\n<br>\nMatt is right that the bias against RPGs is large enough that it's something that you have to battle if you're actively recruiting people a lot. I just don't see much need to do that. LIke Matt says, his predicament is probably worse, simply because in a small town the number of people you can socialize with to begin with is less. <br>\n<br>\nI don't suppose that it would actually help to suggest that you move to a larger metropolitan area, Matt? <br>\n<br>\nMike<br>\n<br>\nP.S. Not sure why Matt is feeling like he needs to laud me (and my guitar playing). But in case it's not clear, I have the utmost respect for Matt. I only ever argue with people for whom I have respect.

It doesn't. I am a strong believer that we are all geeks in our own way and we only feel the 'oppression' of geekery because we exist in a communicative community.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife is very involved in embroidery and patchworking, something that I simply do not understand the attraction of. I was browsing through one of her many magazines on the subject whilst sat on toilet and came across an article about a woman in America who buried her broken needles so that their souls and memories could pass on. Oh how I laughed. I pointed it out to Christine and well, some mocking occured. Now, Christine knows the score when it comes to gaming and she just retorted 'Says the man who has a special bag for his special dice..'<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I had fallen into the trap that we accuse other people of doing - I was mocking someone for their Geek. I was taking part in the same belittling, bullying, ignorant futility that we gamers suffer from on occassion. So we had a chat about her hobby and mine. As it turned out the stuff she is interested in has a lot to do with history and the underground railroad and then we got onto the Bayeux Tapestry and it's influences on Napoleon and his campaigns and whoosh, we spent a good hour in combined geekery.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm very blunt about what I do at work and I have been lucky enough to not have it impact upon me - and I damned well hope that it would not. I'm employed for my creativity and my ability to think on my feet. All skills honed by my years of roleplaying. My trick, I think, is to present gaming as something normal and not a hidden secret. Even when I am talking about Duty &amp; Honour, I am upfront that I am writing a book which is a game, a roleplaying game. Nothings hidden. And if they don't understand I just say 'Like Dungeons and Dragons - but not about Dungeons and Dragons, about Sharpe!' and they get it. (I'll tell you what, explaining what gaming is about is a damned sight easier than explaining about CCGs - 'its like Pokemon but with WWE wrestlers....')<br/>\n<br/>\nSure people are going to rag on gamers for being well .... gamers. I have a friend whose wife has effectively removed him from gaming because of her cultural beliefs about gamers (or at least thats the end of the stick I have got - she's Japanese and she sees gaming as a VERY disturbing activity for grown men to undertake). But then again, there are going to be people who are going to rag on people for being golf players, poetry readers, stamp collectors, whist players, vintage car rebuilders, carpenters, jazz enthusiasts or anything else which deviates one inch from the so-called mainstream. It doesn't mean you have to buy into it or adhere to their stereotypes or argue with them. Its just bullying and as we all know the best way to deal with a bully is to ignore them. Or smack them over the head repeatedly with a 2H boffer sword!<br/>\n<br/>\nRise above it. Embrace your Geek and theirs. Variety is the spice of life and maybe you'll discover a bridge between your Geeks<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134348/#Comment_134348" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T10:11:34+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 10:11AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2008 10:11AM by Stuart.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Building on what Neil just said, here's a cool poster of 56 Geeks:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottjohnson/2086153791/sizes/o/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottjohnson/2086153791/sizes/o/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; Geek is only one of 'em. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134353/#Comment_134353" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T10:19:29+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 10:19AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2008 10:19AM by Thunder_God.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love that picture.<br><br>Also, LARPer geek?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134356/#Comment_134356" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T10:30:41+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 10:30AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Holmes">Mike Holmes</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Stuart... you can say that the problem is just with us being overly-sensitive, and to just get over it.

A group of people who meet in a specific day every week to celebrate what is written on a lot of big thick tomes IS a subculture (and to outsiders, creepily resembles a cult), even if there is not a cat-piss man in the group.<br><br>When I began to play, all these years ago, we had a lot of friends to come over and play a game. Even girlfriends, spouses, etc.  They enjoyed the game and would have gladly played again, "sometimes". When they learned that to "be" in the game (in the subculture) they had to be there to play every week, they quickly excused themselves and never returned.<br><br>Now, finally, there are rpgs that I can play in a single evening with a group of people explaining the rules in five minutes, with no prep time whatsoever. But they are almost considered "not true rpgs" by a lot of gamers. Why? Because they aren't part of that way of playing (once every weeks in basement...etc. etc.), so the subculture don' recognize them.<br><br>The way that subculture actively push people away are many. The inside jokes can be one, but even pushing in the new player' hand a 400-pages book saying "you have to buy and memorize this" is a good way to push the "outsiders" away.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134438/#Comment_134438" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T13:38:07+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  1:38PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Mike">@Mike</a>: If you want to read in all sorts of extra emotions into my posts, I can't do much about that.

I'm highly visible as a gamer myself, but I can see people feeling there is a stigma.  Though it seems like there is a fine line between feeling stigmatized and feeling shame as a gamer.  <br><br>My first disagreement with Matt Snyder's posts is over his statement that he is only interested in play, and feels that it is other activities other than play that constitute the subculture.  <br><br><i>Being a \u201cgamer\u201d is also about making inside jokes, knowing a bunch of complicated and largely insignificant history, respecting certain people (and not others), being a fan about different media and games, and a whole bunch of other stuff that has nothing to do with actually playing the games themselves. It is, in my view, stuff that gets in the way of actually playing the games themselves. It is fun stuff for some people.</i><br><br>In my experience, focusing on play is extremely common even for those who identify strongly as gamers.  Hard-core gamers often get together solely to game, not for non-game socializing.  This has been strongly criticized, for example by Ron Edwards in his discussion of "Social Context" on the Forge.  His desire to just play and not socialize in other ways with gamers makes him more like hard-core gamers.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134481/#Comment_134481" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T16:12:15+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  4:12PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stuart: I'm actually just pointing out that some things (like your "poker" bit) seem to be slipping between the two sites, and you might want to make sure that you're not carrying things back and forth between the conversations unspoken, because it's really confusing to people who aren't following both.<br><br>yrs--<br>--Ben                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134492/#Comment_134492" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T18:04:58+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  6:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt had said "I absolutely have experienced and observed social stigmas talking RPGs to people who enjoy, say, <b>card games</b> or computer games or whatever."<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought card games = poker, because I know guys who like card games -- which means poker (eg. poker night, online poker, watching world championship of poker on TV).

My experiences and reactions match up pretty closely with the "oh yeah, we do need to un-geek the image of gaming" stuff that Mike and Matt and company seem to have had. <br><br>I do a lot of improv theater and comedy. My main social circle these days is composed of people who get up on stage in front of an audience and play characters, make up stories, and act out all kinds of crazy, crazy, crazy stuff that a "normal" person would ever even think of, much less gleefully perform them in front of others in public. And yet, when occasionally I bring up roleplaying, even when I talk about hippie-indie narrative stuff, the reaction is generally chilly to condescending, with the denigrating nerd-stereotype comments and jabs close behind. (There are a handful of ex- or sometime-gamers in the group, but they're few and far between, and I've never broken through the wall deeply enough to actually game with any of them yet.) So, there you go. Even in the most likely hotbed of potential gamers, we find derision. Sure, the reaction isn't universal, and it's entirely possible that my perception is clouded or warped in some way, but that's what I got. Take it as you will. <br><br>Do I give a crap about what people think of what I do with my free time? Hell no. But the stigma is out there, undeniably. Can that be changed? Man. I dunno. I also pretty strongly disagree with Mike's assertion that we don't need to expand the market. Sure, we don't *need* to, but it would be pretty freaking sweet if we could. But that's just me being selfish - more people liking stuff that I like to do equals more opportunities for me to do that stuff with people I like. Seems like a clear win to me.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134526/#Comment_134526" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T02:12:22+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  2:12AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll share a piece of something I've experienced about all of this.<br><br>Most of my gaming happens with non-RPG geeks. Plenty of them are anime, comics, videogame, theatre, computer and fandom geeks. My wife belongs to superhero comics fandom, and is geeky enough to know how to fix her own computer. They're all geeky in their own way. But I can say this with almost certain confidence -- I seem to be the only one of them who is more than passingly interested in role-playing games of the non-electronic, offline kind.<br><br>Part of this is because, frankly, of cost issues. RPGs used to be <em>freaking</em> expensive where I am (Malaysia). They still are, but at least, now you can rely on PDF downloads, games that rely on cheaper d6es, that sort of thing. That's no longer an issue.<br><br>What's happening instead is that a great number of people don't know what RPGs are; or, you know, associate it with electronic gaming. Seriously, people don't <em>know</em> here, that you can play RPGs without having a computing device anywhere near. Some of them remember playing old D&amp;D games, or perhaps Robotech, or GURPS or whatever... but unless you had the money or the wherewithal, you wouldn't know that people still play these games. <br><br>And there's the stigma. Up until a few years ago, my father associated D&amp;D with BADD (yes, Pat Pulling). My brother actually actually said, "What, got no life, is it?" when I let slip that I had gotten a bunch of friends over for a game of T&amp;J. I'd like to say I didn't care, but let's face it, I've never actually experienced the subculture enough to feel like the hobby was "okay" or "normal". Talking to people about it tends to be uncomfortable, even to this day. There is a lot of baggage to push through when you try to sell the idea of gaming to people.<br><br>Maybe all I need to do is gain a positive attitude. Maybe; heaven knows I try, and I'm very grateful that I have a wife who <em>is</em> supportive of what I do and is able to lend her enthusiasm and skills to help me get my game on. I appreciate the people who made it easy, cheap and non-time-consuming for me to actually play (I have to thank Chad for that, with his PDQ system). I'm not exactly representative; I get that.<br><br/>But there are days that I wish trying to get some game wouldn't be so goddamn fucking <em>hard</em>. Which is why I appreciate what people like Matt are trying to do; if in the end what happens is that there's one less barrier of entry for non-gamers and people who play with non-gamers like me, I'm all for it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134553/#Comment_134553" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T06:14:31+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  6:14AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good example of what I meant by gets into all sorts of things that are specific to us as individuals and the games we're talking about.

I'm not a hippy gamer either.  Like so many things (eg Inside Gamer Subculture / Outside Gamer Subculture ) it's not about absolutes.<br/><br/>I do think that games that are more fun / retro have an easier time than games that a serious / modern.  That has little to do with being indie.</blockquote>\nYou say in a sentence that you are "against absolutes", and in the next one you say that some games are objectively, for everybody, more fun than others, because they "aren't serious"?<br/><br/>Who decide what is "fun" and what isn't?<br/><br/>(well, that question, I have seen, has two answers. The first one is "nobody can", the second is valid only inside of a subculture, every subculture based about something that should be "fun", and is "what we do is fun for everybody, what we don't do shouldn't be fun for any intelligent person")<br/><br/>I mean, even now on the other forum you cited I can see thread after thread about something that "obviously isn't fun for any right-thinking person"...<br/><br/>What can I say, Stuart? Playing in a dungeon every week, week after week, trying to get to next level? Been there, done that, now it would bore me to tears. Maybe in a few years I will be nostalgic and find again "fun" in doing that, but not now. Now I am excited about playing a down-to-his luck boxer destined to fail and lose his dreams, or in playing some other thing labeled "unfun" by the people who define rpgs as "what we always did and we will always do".<br/><br/>Being part of a subculture give you rose-colored glasses. You don't see any problem in what you do, it's "normal", you really don't see the problem.<br/><br/>Let's say I wanted to show my girlfriend how is this thing called "role-playing". I want to show it in the best-possible way. So I could try a game of Breaking the Ice, it would be fun, but what about a game of Nicotine Girls? Less fun, maybe, but that would really impress her.  <br/>This is what I would do, because I know her, as a person, an individual with personal likes and dislikes.<br/><br/>If I, naively, would ask some other forum about the game to use with her, the usual, normal answer I would get would be to show her some "fun game", where she could play a miniature going into a dungeon to kill some cobold, getting loot, get xp, repeat next time, and the next, and the next...  <br/><br/>And the absurd thing is... they are not kidding me. They really believe it. They really believe that that would "more fun". For everybody (or, at least, for any "right-thinking person"). Their answer to the question "how to get more people playing?" is "let them see how fun is going in my basement every week to kill some orc", and if somebody don't enjoy that, it mean that that somebody in any case would not like to play anything so "complex and mature" and should return to watch TV.<br/><br/>Rose-colored glasses. All is well. The hobby is like it should be. Perfect. Unchangeable. Next week, we will play again. and again. and again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134581/#Comment_134581" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T09:02:10+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  9:02AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I've always disagreed with Matt that we need to expand the market.

It's why I'm not advocating that. Yes, I used the term "un-geek." No, in using it I never meant it to be "taking an exisiting geek and changing him or her to no longer be a geek." Among other issues, that's just not practical, like you said.<br><br>It's also why I said things like I want to make the <i>activity</i> understood and understood as "less geeky" for some. And, similarly, it's also why I said I am <i>sad</i> that the existing geeks (who, again, I do not want to change as people) largely turn the activity into a case for idenity, something like "I'm not just a geek, I'm a <i>gamer</i> because I do X,Y and Z and also because I play game A, B, and C."

And by working hard to make new games and new things that go towards removing this stigma, we can get these people into playing with us, expand the market into millions of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is in fact correct, how is World of Warcraft not already doing this? And I only ask this because I, personally, am located in Caracas, Venezuela. There are no other 'gamers' here. It's me and the general population as far as my games are concerned. And the way I get players for my games is basically, "You know World of Warcraft? It's like that, but instead of a computer, we'd play with each other, in the living room, just sitting around having some beers and talking." And that's it. With that, I can get say seven out of ten people to play. Out of those who play, maybe half of those want to play again. And so it goes. I've been doing this for years. There's really no stigma. There used to be, yes. There isn't any more. Thanks to the Lord of the Rings movies and WoW, for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, I would second and third the idea that these perceived social disasters or whatever, are a lot more linked to geography and the local quirks of the people who live wherever you are. Iowa? I have no idea about that place... But from what I read, I would say that yes, indeed, it's not surprising to have the kind of reaction that you describe, there. I certainly can't imagine anyone here jabbing me, shaming me or belittling me for offering a game of Dogs in the Vineyard, In a Wicked Age, Primetime Adventures, Agon, or D&amp;D, all of which I've done repeatedly to great success. And this is in Latin-American culture, which is *a lot* less concerned with 'political correctness' than other cultures, believe me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to sum up, I fully agree with Stuart, we are already in an age where once you leave your insecurities behind and just go for it, you will find it's surprisingly easy to do so. You just have to be positive, enthusiatic (but not fanatical) and open-minded about it. And you also have to find the right people. If somebody shames you for offering a game, don't play with that person :) find another. It's only when you say 'OK, but I want *him* to play. Him. The person who laughed at me yestersay, I want *him* to play today.' That it becomes a real problem. Just let go of that need, And you'll be much better off, and you'll find that the normal, cool, non-geek community of players that you're searching for has been there all along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134683/#Comment_134683" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T14:55:37+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  2:55PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>What I actually do advocate is<i>also</i>probably impractical.

I'm guessing here, but it seems like nostalgia + free time is the secret sauce here (which is also why I totally believe RPG clubs will soon be arriving in retirement homes and senior communities). </li>\n<li>There are poker nights, but that's probably more about male bonding and gambling than about the game itself.  </li>\n<li>And of course there's computer gaming (still pretty geeky) and console gaming (somewhat less geeky, esp. as you enter Wii territory and Guitar Hero: i.e. some physical skill + low-overhead/low-consequence party games). </li>\n</ul>\nSo where would you envision ungeeked RPGs fitting into the mainstream game ecosystem?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134694/#Comment_134694" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T15:15:14+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  3:15PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, I don't care whether you go out and tell people about games or not, it doesn't bother me in the slightest.

There will be some places in the world where it might be different from where I live, or Henrique lives.  I don't believe the US is one of those countries.  Tracey Hickman lives in Utah and is part of the Mormon Church -- but he's very open about his gaming.  I'd be more than happy to talk to a pastor or minister near where I live about how a roleplaying game not only isn't something that's morally corrupt -- it can be a great tool for teaching the lessons of the faith to young people.<br/><br/>It gets back to that same point -- there isn't a homgeneous "Geek Gamer Culture" -- it has more to do with us as individuals.  Like Henrique just said "once you leave your insecurities behind and just go for it, you will find it's surprisingly easy to do so"<br/><br/>So if Matt's point is -- I want to game with people who don't make Monty Python jokes and watch Anime -- they're already out there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134739/#Comment_134739" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T19:10:49+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  7:10PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Henrique</cite>And by working hard to make new games and new things that go towards removing this stigma, we can get these people into playing with us, expand the market into millions of people.</blockquote>\nNot necessary.

Some people have had it easier, some haven't. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that your experience is invalid; it's just that, based on what I've seen and found, this is what my experience is like. So, yeah, your statement that we are in an age where being open and enthusiastic is all you need to do to get your game on and be accepted... is going to be treated with some degree of skepticism on my part. It's one thing to say that you need to be positive and open-minded to recruit non-gamers to your cause -- that's actually self-evident. But <em>easy</em>? Mmm, yes, okay. Good for you.<br/><br/>Maybe at this point I'm not comfortable with being a geek, or insecure. This is actually very likely. But hey, I'm not being shamed, people aren't witch-hunting me, all they do is occasionally give me the odd look or the occasional disparaging remark. Organizing a session and getting people to play has been, in my experience, difficult, but it's really because I'm stuck with obligations to work, family and friends, not because people people think I'm a Satanist or a decadent man-child. <br/><br/>Or, hey, if they do, it isn't necessarily because I play tabletop RPGs.<br/><br/>Oh, and in my experience? Getting WoW fans to play can be harder, because on top of friends, family and work, they have the game itself as a concern. I've got a WoW player in our latest group, and we have to tell her the date of the next game a week or so in advance, because she regularly goes on raids with her guild. So yeah, explaining to her the basic mechanics is easy; getting her to commit is harder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Henrique" title="Henrique"><img alt="Henrique" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Henrique">Henrique</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134754/#Comment_134754" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T22:21:08+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 10:21PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2008 10:30PM by Henrique.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><cite>Posted By: T-Boy</cite><br/><br/><cite>Posted By: Henrique</cite><br/>And this is in Latin-American culture, which is *a lot* less concerned with 'political correctness' than other cultures, believe me.<br/></blockquote>\nI think you've answered your own question there.<br/><br/><br/>Hm. I think you might be misunderstanding me here <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'll be a bit more blunt: By this statement I mean that Latin American people are way more openly racist, homophobic, chauvinistic, and casually-humiliating of anything that they don't like, without any problem of it whatsoever. We don't have the 'tread lightly' conventions that you guys have. If anyone over here did find something to be derisive about in my playing roleplaying and 'story' games, they would do so immediately and openly, without any care or worry. This is the truth, and I know it because despite speaking good English, I am one of these people.<br/><br/>And yeah I do get odd looks and remarks, too. You know what I do? I blow through 'em. Find someone else. You have one player who's a flake? I've had ten, twenty. Find someone else. That's what I'm saying. If you get hung up on that one girl who's a flake, *that* is when it becomes difficult.<br/><br/>Anyway, I do agree with you though: It's individual experience. I think we all agree it's individual experience. Which brings to mind the question, why is this Matt Snyder personage trying to make his own individual experience into the 'General Gamer Culture' experience? It isn't. It's his singular individual experience. Some will agree, some won't. That's the point, basically. And that's why the whole "gamer subculture" thing is in fact a myth, like the title of this thread says.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134755/#Comment_134755" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T22:23:00+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 10:23PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2008 10:25PM by Moreno R..">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this will discussion will not go anywhere, because when someone here say that they would like to get rpgs out of the gamers' basement, a lot of people only hear "we want to get more people into the same old basement every week" instead.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's because they are unable to think of different ways of playing a rpg, of if they can, but consider them "not true rpgs", or what. I suppose it depends on the individual poster experience with other games. But either way, this disconnection is making this thread go around and around pushed by incomprehensions.<br/><br/>For example...  when someone say something like "millions of people play WoW, why they didn't come to the basement to run games with you? This shows that the millions of non-gamers who would like to play that you are talking about don't exist", it shown a basic misunderstanding of what a "game for non-gamers" is. It isn't, for example, Rolemaster instead of D&amp;D, or Over the Edge instead of D&amp;D.  They are still the same kind of game, "come with us in the basement and play every week".  <br/><br/>The proof that a game that would cater to million of non-gamers can be done is, simply, in the fact that <b>it is already done</b>. WoW is that game. There is no need to find the magical rpgs that will push these millions of persons to come to the basement to play with dice and rulebooks with the gamers. They have already done a game that allow you to play a warrior in a fantasy land in your home, when you want, without having to meet other people in a basement or buying a lot of dice or reading  book full of rules. And millions of people wanted to play with it, many more than D&amp;D ever had.<br/><br/>WoW isn't the proof that millions of players don't exist, "because they are playing something other than D&amp;D". This is evident to anybody who don't restrict the definition of rpgs to "only what we gamers play as an rpg". These millions of players are the proof that a lot of people were interested in playing something like that, but the structure of the hobby kept them outside.<br/><br/>WoW is really sucky and shallow as an RPG? Well, even D&amp;D is. I see the relationship of WoW to D&amp;D as a mirror of the one between D&amp;D and other more "personal" rpgs: for the most part people aren't really interested into expressing a character or creating story, so much as into killing enemies and taking their stuff. And WoW give that (without the gamer's basement) much more than D&amp;D, that did that much more than GURPS, that did that much more than Sorcerer.<br/><br/>But, at the same time, IF the numerical relationship is the same, going "outside of the basement" for story-games could mean get a similar percentage increase in the number of player that WoW had over D&amp;D. It's not like there is some advantage in staying in the basement where everybody is playing D&amp;D, anyway...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134776/#Comment_134776" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T02:38:58+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  2:38AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Moreno, that's exactly what I was trying to express on other threads when I said that I feel like its a great time to be a gamer, because we live in a world where gaming now saturates everything. I've not had someone tell me it's *childish* to play games in years, because everyone plays games. Our shops are full of games, every household has a gaming console or a PC, playing games is something that everyone has seen on the news, or the internet, or in their own home, it's just normal. And fantasy and SF are just the same, you can't go a month without a fantasy or SF movie or serial for people to watch, I love it!<br/><br/>And sure those people aren't all playing precisely *my* sort of game, but that doesn't matter in terms of acceptance. If anything most people I talk to that are not roleplayers have a sort of nostalgic view of RPGs, because it is something they did at University, or as a kid, or their brother did or something. Sure they might be a bit confused that I'm still doing *old fashioned* games rather than new shiny ones, but they aren't confused that I have gaming as a hobby, it's mainstream <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134779/#Comment_134779" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T02:57:03+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  2:57AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Henrique</cite>Which brings to mind the question, why is this Matt Snyder personage trying to make his own individual experience into the 'General Gamer Culture' experience?

I figured his main points were that it would be good to separate the activity from the subculture that grew around it; that "play" and "community" are not necessarily the same thing. The culture may not apply to where we are (well, it does to where I am, but in a different way), but to indelibly tie one with the other can be destructive.

This sort of problem does happen a lot, though, especially when people aren't too clear about what's being talked about. My impression of it is that Matt's saying that what he wants to break apart gaming the activity from gaming the subculture. He seems to be saying that gaming is too, I don't know, I guess insular, and that insularity is a barrier in getting other people to game.<br/><br/>What seems to be a sticking point here is that gamers, strangely enough, have conflicting experiences on this. While I don't know exactly how <em>true</em> the barrier and culture is (I think it's real enough; Henrique and Stuart don't think so), I get this feeling that opening the hobby a little, and divorcing the act of roleplaying from the culture surrounding it wouldn't be a <em>bad</em> thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134796/#Comment_134796" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T06:11:28+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  6:11AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><br/>WoW isn't the proof that millions of players don't exist, "because they are playing something other than D&amp;D".

WoW is a good indication that it's not the genre of D&amp;D that's not appealing - - exactly the opposite.  You also don't need to do any sort of meeting and getting to know real people before you play -- you just start playing.<br/><br/>That might be the structure of the hobby... but it's not about the genres of fantasy / adventure, or any perceived "geekness" of the games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134801/#Comment_134801" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T06:34:40+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  6:34AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was younger I was a lot more shy and had trouble speaking in front of a room of people.

I might still be introverted, but I have no trouble walking into a room full of strangers and talking with people, or having to suddenly address a room full of people.

If you're picking the wrong people to talk to, or bringing up games that YOU like but they probably won't... you've failed before you even begin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Know your material thoroughly. Put what you have to say in a logical sequence. Ensure your speech will be captivating to your audience as well as worth their time and attention.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nDon't ramble or blurt out something they'll find strange and hard to relate to.  Immediately jumping into details of your gaming session is probably a bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Know what your strong and weak points are. Emphasize your strong points.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nFun.  Social.  Active Participation.  Time Consuming.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Body language is important. </b><br/>\n<br/>\nThis can be hard without confidence and experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Speak with conviction as if you really believe in what you are saying. </b><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the point Henrique and I have been making about confidence.  If *you* think it's a hobby you should be embarrassed about talking about, and that there will be social fallout for doing so... you're going to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Maintain sincere eye contact with your audience. </b><br/>\n<br/>\nThis can again be difficult for a lot of people without confidence and experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Speak to your audience, listen to their questions, respond to their reactions, adjust and adapt. </b><br/>\n<br/>\nVery important.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Pause.

That is, WoW is popular, and represents gaining mainstream support for RPGs, because it is "ungeekified" by precisely the terms that Matt asks for. Oh, to be sure, it's it's own sort of geekery ("Dude, don't agro so many mobs!") But it's not part of the insular TTRPG geekery. They probably overlap some, of course. But those playing WoW don't have to deal with the subculture in question. If every TTRPG player played WoW, they'd be less than half of that population, easily. By any definition. <br>\n<br>\nIn point of fact, we had a thread recently where we all came to the consensus that few people on WoW actually approve of any "real" roleplaying. What does that say? That roleplaying on a supposedly mmoRPG platform is a minority endeavor? <br>\n<br>\nThat said,  AD&amp;D 4E is supposedly trying to head towards the same sort of model as WoW.

The thread in question was specifically about the act of acting and speaking in character on WoW rather than running an avatar. I play on two "Roleplaying" servers for WoW. I have yet to see anyone seriously engaged in playing the game in character or even speaking in character for the most part. Generally the reaction to people speaking in character on one of WoW's Roleplaying servers is that it is "gay." <br>The discussion was not confused as you have suggested. It made for pretty interesting reading, too.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134911/#Comment_134911" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T12:12:18+00:00" title="March 14, 2008 12:12PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Matt said earlier in the thread: "I absolutely have experienced and observed social stigmas talking RPGs to people".
