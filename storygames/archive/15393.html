Last week on Friday, I figured, "Hey, it's just a matter of time before I buy it anyway, let's do this" and got it from Steam. Cut to two nights later and I had already racked up 24 full hours.<br/><br/>Trying to mitigate my OCD-level of Skyrim obsession with the Fitocracy "Do ten pushups for every hour you play Skyrim!" challenge. I've done hundreds of pushups, and still about 200+ pushups in the hole. :-)<br/><br/>So, what parallels or common ground to tabletop gaming have you found?<br/><br/>For me, the main thing, as always with this series, is the wonderful graphics, views of beautiful fantasy stone structures and landscapes that I can "mentally take snapshots of" and later pull them into my games as GM to describe places, objects, sights and sounds.<br/><br/>An interesting thing: Right before I got into Skyrim I went through the great PS2 era action-RPG Odin Sphere on PSN. It has five main characters, 8 or so "areas" that repeat a lot, but between the scripting, voice acting, tie-ins between one character to another (I think I even shed a tear at the end of Mercedes the Fairy Queen's story when she revealed her True Name). So while it is nowhere near as gorgeous, open, varied as Skyrim, I found the story of Odin Sphere gripping.<br/><br/>Comparing that to Skyrim, I find the stories... not so gripping. I walk into SomeTown, I see that the Jarl is arguing with someone about some complicated neo-Tolkien medieval fantasy political shmutz that I don't particularly care about ("Let's just get to the point where you tell me who I need to put arrows into..."). The world/setting is deep (with TONS of books about the history scattered throughout the game) that I don't particularly find interesting. Maybe it's the fact that my character has no voice. The only time she talks is to Yelp In Pain and Shout Dragon Words. She has no history (she's a "wandering murder hobo!") or background. I guess it's up to my imagination - similar to those old ZORK games where we have to imagine everything in our heads - to give her a background and personality. But to me, it makes it easier to get into a character with a Voice and a Past.<br/><br/>However, having said that, I have to say that while I don't particularly care about the World At Large, I do find the small-scale stories that happen within it actually interesting. Like when I go into the Dark Brotherhood and see this little commune and see how there are individuals with their own interests and drives and conflicts, and work within that, that "hits a tabletop roleplaying button" for me. Or when I go to Town X and it has a bunch of people struggling with some particular issue or other related to other NPCs, a little "conflict microcosm", I feel connected to that.  I don't really care about the overall plot of the game, but they did a really good job of making me care about "these four guys over here", "those six guys over there", "those two people who seem to hate each other yet need each other"... that stuff comes out pretty well, and I dig that.<br/><br/>How about you? What do you think?<br/><br/>(my character: A 39th level Redgaurd female sneak-and-bow type. An honorable fatalist (on one face she's honorable and 'good'; on her other face she's the leader of the Dark Brotherhood because That's The Way Things Have to Be)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scndthe2nd" title="scndthe2nd"><img alt="scndthe2nd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scndthe2nd">scndthe2nd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349364/#Comment_349364" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T14:33:17+00:00" title="November 21, 2011  2:33PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Modularity; The nice thing about Skyrim is that each system was developed independantly. From a design standpoint, the system looks as if it were developed and finished a long time ago, and the content was designed based on that system. Some might call it a bottom-up design structure. My major problem with skyrim is just that. Modularity. Maybe i've been doing this too long, but I take a look at the design of some of the quests and i start to see the seams in them. Some look really polished -- like the golden claw quest. Others look really unpolished like the magic college quests.<br/><br/>Some mechanics were implemented that I used once and only once, like rotating the claw to see a key combination in the menu screen.<br/><br/>I expected a little more from the game, and from a design standpoint, I saw fallout 3 with Oblivion content.

The war stuff doesn't grab me, but rolling into a town, Dogs style, and getting all up in their twisted shit is great.<br/><br/>I also love the "tip of the iceberg" quest style, where something seemingly simple turns and twists into something mind-blowing and epic.

The changes in height and architectural style mean that I always know what town I'm hanging out in, even if I'm just fast-travelling in to sell off loot.<br/><br/>I love how rich and detailed all the quests feel. I agree with you Andy, this game doesn't feel like it's "Here's one big epic story where you get to save the world". It's more about "Here's one little story about love, power, betrayal, etc. And maybe it turns out to be much bigger than you first thought. And here's another. And here's another."<br/><br/>I like how the named vs misc quests are sometimes misleading. Some of the named ones are pretty simple and straightforward. Some of the misc ones are surprisingly deep and involved. That reminds me of a tabletop campaign game - sometimes little things become major elements because the players grab onto them and make them important.<br/><br/>I like good crafting systems. So far smithing and enchanting have been fun. But as with previous games, the alchemy system makes me want to use the Internet. I wish they would put lots and lots more recipe sheets out as random things to find. There's alchemy labs showing up in dungeons in nearly random locations - do all these alchemists just keep all their knowledge in their heads and not take notes? Also - potions are really heavy in this game - self-made potions don't save you weight, the way they did in previous games, which further decreases my desire to spend time on alchemy. Which is sad, because I want to care about it. But it's a minor gripe, overall.<br/><br/>Another minor gripe - it's neat that there's so many people you can get as a follower, but it results in having less rich dialog with each one. The followers in New Vegas were amazing - a major highlight of the game. In Skyrim they're enjoyable, and they definitely have a different feel from each other. But I think having too many choices meant that each one was less well done.<br/><br/>Which is sad, because the locations you visit are extremely well done. Over and over and over again, I visit a new place, and it just feels so right. The people are having their various problems. And they're interesting ones. And sure, they all seem to have issues that a dangerous looking stranger would be perfect to solve, but for the most part the dialogs and interactions are great.<br/><br/>So I wish there was that extra element where your follower would chime in and become a more interesting part of your explorations. And I don't just mean as part of an up front "follower quest", after which they lapse into silence once they become your actual follower.<br/><br/>And it needs to be done in a way that isn't just "Oops. Can't do what I want to right now, because ___ is with me and they'll get mad and leave my party if I do that."<br/><br/>I think having richer follower interactions would help decrease that sense of "I'm a wandering, backgroundless, murdering hobo that people in trouble have a bizzare habit of trusting instantly with their embarrassing secret problems." Because at least your followers would have stronger backgrounds that would interact with these people in interesting ways. And, of course, there's tons of potential for replay value that way.<br/><br/>So I would have voted for a much smaller group of companions, each more strongly developed. Dragon Age, New Vegas, Mass Effect each did a better job with that element.<br/><br/>But with that said, I totally agree that each of the little quest stories is exceptionally well crafted. This game does exactly what I want a crpg to do - it gives me tons and tons and tons of stuff to explore. And as I explore, it keeps giving me new and interesting things to see and do that haven't gotten repetitive at all.<br/><br/>Another minor gripe - dragons are a little too easy to kill. I had much more trouble with a frost troll and with The Skinner guy in the Silver Hand. Maybe they'll level up with me and get harder (because I'm crafting and I don't feel super optimized). That being said, they're still pretty darn neat, the way they show up all over the place and not just is super scripted fight locations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349524/#Comment_349524" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-22T21:25:26+00:00" title="November 22, 2011  9:25PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm very ambivalent about the game. The game looks very pretty but is mechanically disastrous. Not a single bit of the mechanical subsystems work in a satisfying way. Some of the dungeon designs are interesting, an occasional quest is good. I hate almost every NPC I meet within seconds and I hate how I can't even interact with them in the way I want. I don't even think I can consider this a roleplaying game since roleplaying is so far removed from what I do while I play it. Every time I even feel an urge to Play My Character As If I Am In Their Shoes the game ties my hands. Racist asshole threatening to invade the homes of foreigners? I haven't found out how to trigger the quest involving him so I literally cannot interact with him in any way. Wrongfully accused some wizard of multiple murders? The game hasn't decided that I am allowed to present new evidence I found until arbitrary point A. Blatantly evil character? Can't just kill him and skip 3/4 of the magic school quests.</p>\n<p>Combat feels like two boxes rubbing up against each other until one of them runs out of points, stealth feels so disconnected from the game world that I can't believe anyone would even bother. Archery feels tepid. I feel spoiled by Action RPGs with good combat.</p>\n<p>I've played the game about 7 hours and I'm around level 25 I think. I have one good story. I saw a guy on the road collecting ingredients so I robbed him blind. 3 hours later, I am being attacked by Hired Thugs and Dark Brotherhood Assassins, hired by this guy. He really hated me.</p>\n<p>Regarding the setting, it's disappointing. I was very fond of Daggerfall and Morrowind's Lore, especially since Morrowind did <a href="http://fallingawkwardly.wordpress.com/2010/08/29/the-metaphysics-of-morrowind-part-1/" rel="nofollow">really cool things</a> with how the lore related and influenced the game, tying the color in with the mechanics. I loved how <em>weird</em> everything was in those two games. It should be no surprise that I hated Oblivion because of it's total lack of interesting lore, good mechanics or a decent plot. Skyrim tries a little bit to be interesting, and even shares some of the better writers from Morrowind but it's spread a bit thin and I keep getting the feeling that all the interesting stuff is outside of the region of Skyrim.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349536/#Comment_349536" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T09:26:26+00:00" title="November 23, 2011  9:26AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played a CRPG seriously since the mid 80s.

Not sure about the dragon shouts thing, seems a bit video gamish rather than fantasy adventure inspired.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey give you a lot of leeway in creating characters but the "roleplaying" aspect of the game is hard to do with many character concepts, that hasnt really changed from Morrowind thru Oblivion to Skyrim.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Morrowind I came into the game with what I think is the perfect character concept for these games.  A con-man merchant, jack of all trades type.  He wants to be friends (and make money off of) everyone so he's willing to do almost any task for anybody.  Always out for himself, personal goal is to get rich and more powerful however he can.  Gave a reason to get involved with some of the aspects of the game I would probably not be all that interested in like the alchemy and enchanting and such plus had an excuse to break into houses to steal things and then sell them at local shops (got tons of enjoyment out of the speechcraft game and boosting the merchant skill).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other way to play it and get full enjoyment is to create several characters to investigate all the different aspects.  Did that with Oblivion but it't didnt feel as compelling, for certain you need to be a fairly amoral character primarily concerned with your own well being.  There just isnt the depth in the game to attach yourself to any cause or faction and get much interesting gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI havent explored the magic enough yet but I'm guessing there's no Levitate?  That was really cool in Morrowind, being able to float over everything and land almost anywhere and the houses that were impossible to navigate without levitate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349615/#Comment_349615" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-24T10:20:57+00:00" title="November 24, 2011 10:20AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone wants to experience Skyrim without playing it:<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GhostRobo#p/search/0/O7jNCEQhqCU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/GhostRobo#p/search/0/O7jNCEQhqCU</a> </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349660/#Comment_349660" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-25T08:36:42+00:00" title="November 25, 2011  8:36AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWNMLw80poY" rel="nofollow">Now that you've played Skyrim, do you want to have gay sex?</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AJohandsome" title="AJohandsome"><img alt="AJohandsome" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AJohandsome">AJohandsome</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349706/#Comment_349706" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T06:50:01+00:00" title="November 26, 2011  6:50AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skyrim is the first computer/console game that I've spent hours talking about with my friends in absolute ages.

I load it up every once in a while as an Evil Termination Arrow Simulator (hide in the shadows, shoot evil). But yeah, the shallowness of it particularly regarding the range of things you can be/do is really a jarring reminder that the game is flawed.<br/><br/>I'm the champion of the Dark Brotherhood, the most powerful assassin on Tamriel. Some folks whisper ("I know you you are! Hail Sithis!") as I pass by. Yet otherwise I'm a "good guy". I only kill dudes "who deserve it". However, yeah the Daedra lord quests are awful in that regard: Here I am trying to "be pretty good by adventurer standards", and all the Daedra lord quests pretty much end with you doing horrible things to people without any chance of outwitting them. For example:<br/><br/>There was a cannibal Daedra lord, but I was able to arrow her follower to death and end that quest. So that was okay, but...<br/><br/>The Daedra lord who possesses the evil haunted house. He tells you to free a priest. The priest (who is good) then makes a beeline for the house and tries to destroy the evil altar. Once you follow him back to the house, there's no option to tell him to flee, to give up the quest, or to aid him in destroying the altar: You can only leave the house after you beat him to death with a spiked club. That's dumb.<br/><br/>The Daedra lord who is like "get someone to trust you, lead them here and then kill them!" I'm like, "YES! I'll totally do that... WITH YOUR OWN PRIESTESS!!!" I have pretty buff Speak skills so I figured it would be the ultimate awesome thing, hell it would probably even make the Daedra lord happy at the irony. But nope, no option to do that. Suck.<br/><br/>Or other stuff: I did the Magic College quests cause they all happened to be in the same general area and pretty easy. At the end, this old mage turns to me and is all, "You are the most worthy candidate to be our new Archmage! Congrats! Here's the key to your new pad!" And I'm like, "Uh... I already have a swank pad (in my Assassin's Cave of Awesomeness) and I've only been a member of your college for approx four days of in-game time. So I think I'll pass..." but you can't. <br/><br/>I imagine that later on people will eventually hack up some mods and quests that are deep, meaningful, or connected. But yeah, the ankle-deepness is kinda shining through at this point. I still like the effect that each group you meet is a mini-cosm of society with its own problems, but as a while there's no connection from one group to another...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349820/#Comment_349820" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T12:58:39+00:00" title="November 28, 2011 12:58PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game is definitely flawed, but I'm still enjoying it.  The majority of the quests are really simple-minded, go there and kill that dude, and there is a distinct lack of consequences except for major scripted ones (like if you join the Stormcloaks and take over Whiterun, there's "battle damage" afterwards).<br/><br/>I am enjoying the large amount of content so far though.  Like the College of Winterhold line took me as long to complete as the main quest line in Fable 2 and it's a completely optional thing.  I've put 40 hours into the game and I've barely touched the main quest.  It's very shallow, but it's pretty and I enjoy killing monsters and taking their stuff.<br/><br/>I played Morrowind on and off for 5-6 years.

I've always liked the idea of the series even as it is, although Morrowind was too slow for me, and Oblivion was too broken for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm much more interested in exploring things and seeing what stuff is out there. The game has a nice variety to it's...texture? Feel? The gameplay isn't always radically different but the spaces often seem to be. I think there are better and worse parts of it, though. Sometimes dungeons are linear lines, sometimes dungeons are awesome underground cities with criss-crossing paths.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm on hour 30 or so, and I'm going to try doing the Dragon hunting quests next, and I'm also interested in trying to play the game as a Mage instead of a Thief. Sure, I'd like it to acknowledge my effects more, but I think I won't hold that against them until the inevitable part VI.

The little side quests were good. I enjoyed them.<br><br>Skyrim doesn't give me 1 main storyline. It gives me 2 really big quests - dragonborn quest and war quest. Plus it gives me a whole bunch of faction quest lines - Champions, Thieves, Assassins, Mages, etc. Plus it gives me Jarl quest lines. Plus it gives me "hey buddy can you help me" quests, like the Redguard lady in Whiterun. Plus it gives me "hey, you found this thing, now follow up on it" quests, like the Galdur amulet ones. Plus there's power grinding quests, like looking for more shouts. And then, after all that, there's the relatively generic "There's vampires in Bloodmaw cave." type quests.<br><br>I've put in like 70 hours and I feel like I'm just getting my feet wet.<br/><br/>So not every single one of the, what, 1000 named NPCs? remembers me and reacts in accordance to what all I've done.<br/><br/>When the game gives me that many things to choose from, and does this good of a job of fleshing them out, I can live with that.<br/><br/>Some games force you to do more of a "pick a side" thing. And people get whiny because they are forced to play the game through multiple times in order to see all the content. Other games let you pursure lots of different angles all at the same time, but people get whiny because they feel like the game doesn't react logically to their decision to be the paragon of good and champion of evil at the same time.<br/><br/>Personally, I love it when a game lets me explore as much as possible of the content in a single pass through. I don't restart games and play them over again very often. So I am grateful that Skyrim is designed with a few limitations as possible. Sure, the result is that the game doesn't always react to my actions in a deep way.<br/><br/>But here's the thing - in the games where the world reacts in big deep meaningful ways - that's because the game forced you to make a choice - generally a binary choice - at some point. <br/><br/>And those games where you can complete a mission in like 7 different ways all the time - that's because those are pure linear mission-based games, rather than an open world where you can wander around do whatever damn thing you please whenever you want.<br/><br/>Having worked with IT development teams for several years now, it blows my mind how good of a job this game does of keeping track of so much different stuff in order to present me with a world that feels so wornderfully persistant. <br/><br/>Sometimes a little too persistant. I wish mudcrabs would respawn a little faster. They're my favorite way to capture petty souls for enchantment grinding.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349925/#Comment_349925" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T11:11:20+00:00" title="November 29, 2011 11:11AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2011 11:13AM by Vernon R.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a valid defence of the game.

It's also why it has a believable setting that doesn't fall apart as soon as you try to interact with it. New Vegas with the Dead Money DLC especially is the best bethesda style first person open world fuck-arounder gaming has. Probably what makes New Vegas work is, like so many classic 90s/early 00s rpgs, your choices matter to you and to the world around you.</p>\n<p>The problem with the NPCs in Skyrim. You are given at most two ways to interact with them from the following three: kill them, ignore them, do their 10 second fetch quest. At least 80% of the NPCs can only be ignored or killed, because they not any good for anything else. 10% can't be killed but can be ignored because they're tagged as plot important but don't actually have any bearing on any quests. 9.9% have 10 second fetch quests that they expect a legendary hero to do for some trifling gold pieces. The remaining dozen NPCs have questlines half as ambitious as those in Morrowind and probably three times as idiotic. That's not good enough for a game in 2011, especially not one that promises role playing. Cave Story, a japanese indie action game from 2004 has more elaborate NPC interactions on average.</p>\n<p>Re: the leveled monsters in Skyrim. They went with a modified Fallout New Vegas system. Normally, the first time you enter an area, that area will only have creatures and bad guys at your level and they will stay at the level they were when you first entered the area.. However, many of these areas have both a maximum level and a minimum level. So for instance if you are level 22 and first enter a level 1-15 area, everything will be at level 15, if you first enter a level 20-30 area, everything will be level 22. If you enter a level 30-50 area, everything will be level 30. It's an ok band-aid on a bad idea.</p>\n<p>It's still flawed. If you made the mistake of investing perks in non-combat skills in the first ten levels of the game, you will be horrifically outclassed by everything until you grind for a few levels and put points into a weapon skill or destruction magic. Conversely, if you focused solely on combat skills for the first ten levels, you will be blessed with never having to deal with the terrible combat system again. You can just relax and kill every enemy you encounter in one hit and so long as you drop a perk into a combat/destruction skill once every few levels, you'll keep such a massive lead on everything you encounter that the game never becomes a challenge. Don't make the mistake I did of assuming the skill number is used for anything except what perks you qualify for.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349979/#Comment_349979" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T17:10:35+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  5:10PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll have to go back and play New Vegas again with Dead Money.

I wasn't conscious of it at the start, but I think this is a big part of what has made it fun for me since I started playing a week ago.<br/><br/>I have a pretty strong character concept, some of which was chosen at the start, some built up from in-game choices, that I allow to inform my gameplay. <br/><br/>I set goals for myself (I'm going to be the best blacksmith ever!)<br/>I have quirks (I always grab iron daggers from foes and re-smith them for sale)<br/>I have morals (I don't break the law. I only soul trap animals and necromancers. I've never met a nice necromancer.)<br/><br/>I also imagine a lot of dialogue and vignettes to explain or add color to stuff that happens in-game.<br/><br/>It's good, lonely fun.

(And also because I really do like good writing in a game, and New Vegas was done by some of the best in the business.  Skyrim's writing...well, the best you could say for it is that it's "serviceable."  Which is admittedly a step up from most Bethesda games, but still not quite engaging.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350209/#Comment_350209" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T16:59:07+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  4:59PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>That's cool that that works for you, but for me, unless the game pushes back in some way and acknowledges my input (you're the Iron Dagger guy!), it doesn't do anything for me.</blockquote>\nBut it does that. At least a little.<br/><br/>Once my Enchanting skill got to a certain level, random guards starting "Hey - any chance you could enchant my blade too?" or some thing like that. I mean yeah, they don't really mean it. It's not like I can talk to them and they actually have the cash to buy an enchanted blade off me. It would be pretty awesome if they could. <br/><br/>But at least the game is doing something to acknowledge the choices I've been making so far.<br/><br/>It would be great if the game were able to really actively respond to a few more behaviors. Like if you sell of 5 dozen enchanted iron daggers in the same town, then maybe some dude working for the Stormcloaks or the Imperials approaches you and asks you if you'll provide a bunch more for the army at a better buying price than what the merchant would have given you. They could have put in one of these types of things for each of the 3 kinds of crafting skills. And that would be pretty sweet.<br/><br/>The game already has stuff that responds to how you act.<br/><br/>Like when you ask one of the generic Radiant quest givers for a job. They look at where you've been in the world recently and send you to either some place you haven't explored before or at least a place you haven't visited in a long time. And that's where they send you. They don't just always send you to the same place. That's a pretty neat bit of responsiveness. And it's even more impressive given that the request is voice acted. They must have a pretty extensive library of quotes ready to go, spoken by several different people, in order to make that happen. That's a lot of work.<br/><br/>So sure, the game doesn't respong to every choice I make in the way that a super awesome GM would. But I don't play a computer game for that. I play for the chance to explore and interact. And Skyrim has loads of stuff to explore and interact with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LincolnSmash" title="LincolnSmash"><img alt="LincolnSmash" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LincolnSmash">LincolnSmash</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350230/#Comment_350230" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T19:04:20+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  7:04PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sucked me in for the first 15 hours or so the way Fallout 3 did (although I finished Fallout 3 in about 25 hours).  I'm not a huge item collector, I'm not an OCD player, so the sort of "explore everything and get phat lootz" aspect of play doesn't do anything for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is gorgeous and most of the time fun, though.  I was planning on spending more time exploring the world and doing random things, but I find that I want this less the more I continue playing (!), unlike, say, Borderlands, which is one of the first games with gameplay that made me want to do every single sidequest there was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, dunno yet.  I like Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but I always questioned whether I liked them because the gameplay was good, or because I liked the idea of a virtual tour of these worlds.  I certainly avoided real-time in Fallout, and I usually just stuck to the main quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I think I still may end up liking The Witcher more as an RPG, especially because it forces hard decisions and consequences on you in a way that a lot of other games don't, and Deus Ex because the gameplay was a tighter action/RPG mix (aside from the boss battles).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350244/#Comment_350244" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T21:21:23+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  9:21PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got NV shortly after playing the HELL out of F3.
