I like to be able to put my best foot forward, marshal my resources, etc., but I feel really drained and dissatisfied by actually getting to dictate how things shake out.<br/>I don't just mean that I like rolling dice (though I do). When players have an interesting way of debating the outcome, such as in Polaris, it's really engaging, too. The common theme is that I don not want the option of being able to convince all parties in the decision (and here, dice count as a participant) that I am correct. There must be an innate inability to fully form a consensus of interests or decisions, or the whole thing just falls flat for me. <br/><br/>Perhaps oddly, I want to be able to "control" (more accurately, maintain) the impact of my decisions as a player. I don't want everything to always come out my way; but I always want to have my choices matter. I get no satisfaction from fiction-neutral outcomes (that is, when even an abject failure doesn't change the situation in any way), and I consider the possibility of 'whiffing' to be a gap in a game's rules - any outcome that does nothing to the situation at ALL (not even intensifying the situation or anything) is not really worthwhile or interesting to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346241/#Comment_346241" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T15:01:31+00:00" title="October 16, 2011  3:01PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In "standard" playstyle my prioritize look like this:<br/><br/><b>I like a lot of control over:</b><br/>*What my character is feeling. I play to immerse, and have a hard time toning into the feeling if that feeling don't come natural to me.<br/>*How my character act. This is an extension of how my character feels.<br/>*Character death. The character is my tool to be a part of the story. I don't want to get kick out of the story before i feel I'm ready to be kicked out of the story.<br/><br/><b>I want very little control over:</b><br/>*The consequences of my characters actions.

Having a conversation with myself is hard, I don't want the double perceptive you get from controlling multiple character in a scene.<br/><br/><br/><b>And I want some control over:</b><br/>*The environment. If I play in verbal media I want to be able to assume all sort of small things about the gaming would without having to check with the other players gamemaster.<br/><br/><br/><br/> I give up control I rather give it up to another player or a GM, then to a numeric dice roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346267/#Comment_346267" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T22:59:31+00:00" title="October 16, 2011 10:59PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with w176, all the way down that list.  That's the ideal, right there.<br/><br/>About the only thing I can think to add is that I like having some control over where the game goes, plot-wise, but I prefer to have it be more of an indirect influence than a direct control.  I like it when there's a GM or some other kind of game referee who is open to taking suggestions from anyone at the table, whether they come from what we're doing with our characters or what we're talking about out of character or whatever.  I want someone who is responsive to what I want more of, in other words, but I don't want to have the final say or to directly control what's coming next.<br/><br/><br/>If I'm running a game, I want to have: lots of control over the consequences of in-game actions and how the NPCs interact with them; very little control over PCs; and some control over the environment and other setting elements.  I also want players who are really engaged with the game and make a lot of suggestions and push for more of what they want out of the game (by what they have their characters do or through out-of-character channels), so that I can be responsive to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
