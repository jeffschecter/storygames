Look away if you fear the crunch.<br/><br/>The ideal case (in my mind) is that every power is so good you have a hard time choosing which one to take, even if they do radically different things. If one is obviously mechanically better than others, or if there's a "best" choice, that's a fail.<br/><br/>Danger Patrol isn't very power gamey, which can make balance even more of an issue: you should be doing cool stuff, not getting distracted wondering whether the power you took isn't as cool as what someone else has. Honestly, if you removed powers entirely, the game would still work great.<br/><br/>A few misc notes:<br/><br/>Baseline Powers -- Where possible I extrapolated what seems to be the baseline for each type of power to compare. I used the attack power as the baseline across the board, since it's the same for every style and it's very predictable.<br/><br/>Free Powers -- Most styles get fictional bonuses (super-strength, can see auras, etc) but Two-Fisted has major mechanical benefits (Big Damn Hero &amp; Bloodied). Aliens also have their home planet bonus die, but that is unlikely to come up as much as the Two-Fisted bonuses.<br/><br/>Combinations of Powers -- Ideally you'd analyze the combined balanced of all the powers in a particular role or style to see how it stacked up against other roles and styles, but because characters only pick one power that's kind of a red herring -- it would take a lot of danger before a character got to see how all the powers within a role or style worked together. So each power pretty much needs to stand on it's own, or at least in a way that works with any paired role/style.<br/><br/>Style/Role Overlap -- Different styles can have duplicate powers, and different roles can have duplicate powers, but styles should not have the same powers as roles. Otherwise certain combinations will have fewer meaningful power choices. Overlaps are noted below.<br/><br/><br/><b>ATTACK POWERS</b><br/>Attack baseline: do 3 hits automatically. Example: all style attack powers. Because all styles have this power and it's very predictable (no dice are rolled) it's the best for comparing all powers.<br/><br/>Either attack is too good, or everything else is too weak. No other power (except Defense) gives you nearly as much bang for your buck. As it stands, the test for every other power is "is it as good as doing an automatic three hits?" Except for Defense powers, the answer is almost always no. The attack power also makes spending two tokens to take another action a bad investment -- you could get 6 automatic hits with no risk of danger for the same cost. Also compare to spending power to get a d8.<br/><br/>Even ignoring balance, it's potentially anticlimactic. With 4 power tokens, the team can pop even the biggest threat as a free action with no risk of danger, though there are obviously cases in the fiction where you can't "attack" the problem.<br/><br/>possible fixes:<br/>- reduce the damage to 2 (still very useful for finishing off a threat or tapping an untouched threat before it goes at the end of the round)<br/><br/>specific powers:<br/>Professor / Crazy Theory -- redundant with the base attack power in all styles. Should be replaced.<br/><br/><br/><b>DEFENSE POWERS</b><br/>Defense baseline: negate a hit and get bonus die on next action. Example: Two-Fisted / Tough As Nails.<br/><br/>If you want to break the game, taking a Defense power is the way to go. Roll as many danger dice as you can and save all your power tokens. Only use them to cancel hits that would make you KO'd or Vaporized. You should get to the top of the danger meter with no problem -- maybe every fight so long as the fight goes at least five rounds. Danger becomes fairly meaningless. Woo hoo, you win.<br/><br/>possible fixes:<br/>- change defense baseline to reduce hit, not negate hit. If you want to negate a hit, spend two to reduce it twice.<br/><br/>specific powers:<br/>Atomic  / Force Field -- tiny bit below defense baseline, since you also take a danger<br/>Mystic / Dark Bargain -- way below baseline, because it only reduces hit and there's no balancing upside<br/>Psychic / Psychic Shield -- above defense baseline, because it gets a hit instead of bonus die<br/>Robot / Damage Control -- Probably way more powerful than baseline depending on how you interpret it. Can a KO'd or vaporized robot use its power?<br/><br/>[there are a bunch more mixed defense powers I'll get to later]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220749/#Comment_220749" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-25T19:21:17+00:00" title="July 25, 2009  7:21PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2009 7:34PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>BONUS DIE POWERS</b><br/>Bonus Die baseline: do something particular and get a bonus die. Example: Mystic / Black Mists.<br/><br/>Several powers have a dramatic description in the fiction, but mechanically just add a bonus die, which is extremely weak. Description in play is pretty free-wheeling, so buying a power just to get to describe a particular action seems out of place.<br/><br/>Atomic / Gravity Beam<br/>Mystic / Black Mists<br/>Psychic / Telekinesis<br/>Psychic / Command<br/>Robot / Detachable Head<br/><br/>There are also movement powers, but because movement is fairly subjective they don't have clear value and fall in the same category:<br/><br/>Atomic / Atomic Speed<br/>Mystic / Teleport  (fairly powerful narratively, so not so bad)<br/><br/>possible fixes:<br/>- depends how base attack is changed. Could increase the bonus die from one to two, which might balance since these fictional powers could have non-combat utility as well.<br/><br/><br/><b>TEAM ATTACK POWERS</b><br/>Team Attack baseline: all attacks do +1 hit to designated target until fight over. Example: Agent / Primary Target.<br/><br/>Looks good at first, but if you do the math it's rarely a good buy -- it's only useful if it's going to take more than three attacks (including the bonus for this power) to take out the threat. If the characters are normally able to roll three hits on an attack this power only ties the base attack, even vs a 12 threat. Could be useful to offset resistance, but not much else. If there were threats bigger than 12, that could also work.<br/><br/>possible fixes:<br/>- if Attack power baseline is dropped to 2, no fix needed<br/><br/>specific powers:<br/>Detective / Evaluate -- slightly above average, because also tells you how many hits the threat has<br/>Explorer / Lay of the Land -- below baseline, bonus on only one action<br/>Warrior / Critical Strike -- have to have hit the target first, so you're not even getting bonus the first time<br/><br/><br/><b>PASS FREE ACTION POWERS</b><br/>Pass Free Action baseline -- give ally free action for 1 power token instead of 2. Example: Professor / Studied the Schematics.<br/><br/>It's a good power, since you're saving a power token in exchange for giving someone else the spotlight. Of course if everyone had it and just used it round-robin it would break, but only Professor &amp; Robot have it. These powers also overlap, since one is a style and one is a role, so it's bad if someone is a Robot Professor.<br/><br/>specific powers:<br/>Robot / Energy Transfer -- The power token should be lost, not given to the character who gets the free action.<br/><br/><br/><i>(to be continued -- 25 powers down, 12 to go)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220750/#Comment_220750" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-25T19:31:15+00:00" title="July 25, 2009  7:31PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's true, Doctor Abacus should be a Luddite and not use a computer at all.

Some only apply in some situations or under some conditions, but there's a danger of overlap.<br/><br/>(all "negate hits" should be "reduce hits")<br/><br/>Commando / Covering Fire -- Slightly better than baseline defense, but probably okay because it is being used on a teammate. Narratively may be hard to explain (how does covering fire save you from a car crash?). May be better to replace with a different effect, like pass a free action to someone else (you're covering them so they can go) -- same narrative issue.<br/><br/>Explorer / Shrug It Off -- Way overpowered, particularly since it has no condition and can be used on yourself or an ally. Could be replaced with something more Explorer-like, reducing hits from environmental hazards for yourself or ally.<br/><br/>Flyboy / Dogfighter -- Does 2 hits which is very powerful, but only works when piloting so somewhat balances out. If baseline attack is reduced to 2 hits, should reduce this to 1 hit.<br/><br/>Two also grant free actions, but it may be better to change them to just give free actions, not reduce hits:<br/><br/>Daredevil / Dodge and Go -- Overpowered. Overlaps with style defense power plus gives bonus free action. A better option might be just buy a free action after taking a hit (call it something like "Bounce Back").<br/><br/>Warrior / Champion -- May be overpowered. Probably would be just fine only giving a free action, since that will come up a lot for warriors (balances well vs pass free action powers)<br/><br/><br/><b>MISC POWERS</b><br/>The powers that just don't fit in other categories...<br/><br/>Agent / Covert Ops -- Cool idea, but given the structure of the game I'm not sure how often it would come up. Probably should be replaced or changed. [see "Interlude Powers" idea below]<br/><br/>Commando / Guns Blazing -- Rules for spreading attacks across threats are fuzzy, so it's unclear where this fits. Since unharmed threats get to retaliate, letting all characters spread attacks for free makes things too easy. If spreading isn't free (and I don't think it should be), this power is good as written, since you could suppress several threats.<br/><br/>Detective / Steely Gaze -- Unclear. Is threat move reduced for only one round? Using it to stop an ignored threat not as good as using an attack power to harm &amp; suppress threat.<br/><br/>Daredevil / Danger Is My Middle Name -- Overlaps style attack power. Character already took danger, so that's just a condition, not an added penalty. Replace with some other mechanic.<br/><br/>Two-Fisted / Reckless Abandon -- I'm reading this as "roll your Daredevil die along with any attack, count hits and danger as normal." If attack baseline is reduced to 2 hits, this is good.<br/><br/>Two-Fisted / Not Licked Yet -- If defense powers are changed from negate hit to reduce hit, than this is probably balanced.<br/><br/>Flyboy / Hold Together Baby -- Cool. Flyboy equivalent of Two-Fisted / Not Licked Yet.<br/><br/><i>(That's all 37 powers accounted for.

Maybe the Professor can spend a power token to upgrade your raygun, or the Detective can sniff out more clues, Agents steal secret info, etc.<br/><br/>This could be a third power to buy on each role, or a power you get for free but still need to spend a power token to activate.<br/><br/>Basic effects would be things like:<br/><br/>- introduce a second clue / plot point (or alternately a much "bigger" plot point than normal)<br/>- restore more stuff boxes, for yourself or others (Agent "acquires" gear, Professor fixes things, etc)<br/>- heal a hit box on yourself or someone else (Tell Me Where It Hurts first aid from the Professor)<br/>- heal a Bashed box from all characters (this could be a rousing speech from the Daredevil or Warrior that puts the Patrol back in action)<br/><br/><br/>specific powers:<br/><br/>Professor / Experimental Modifications -- Mark three pieces of stuff on any characters.

Presumably the idea of the baseline attack powers is straightforward: spend a power token to eliminate a minor threat. Of course I can see how it might be easier to just reduce one number on the baseline attacks than redo a whole host of variable other powers, but... I do like the whole everything-by-3s element. And, narratively, the eliminate-a-threat thing feels much more in-genre for these powers -- they're like the standard 'thing' that character does almost every episode, and are therefore totally non-dangerous, but an effective way to sweep through 'boring' low-level threats.<br/><br/>Which makes me think: why not instead of reducing the baseline attack damage, have them not do hits at all, but instead: "Spend a power token to eliminate a threat with 3 or less hits remaining" or even better "Spend a power token to eliminate a minor/normal threat." That way it doesn't matter as much how they balance with the other powers, or extra actions: the other powers are what you use for the 'real threats' -- which I think also works really well, narratively, making those threats require more exciting and varied actions. It kind of turns the over-poweredness into a genre thing, by borrowing a little from the 'mook'-style rules of games like Feng Shui or 7th Sea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220837/#Comment_220837" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T17:06:08+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  5:06PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2009 5:06PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm kind of liking that Daniel.

Now I think that fudging can be a perfectly useful tool in the gaming toolkit, when presented in a functional way in the right context. Thus, the Danger Patrol implementation. It's fudging that serves a clear purpose in the game, is known to everyone, and puts fudging behaviors in a spotlight. I hope to challenge the extreme notion that a GM who alters game mechanical elements on the fly is (always) doing something bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221028/#Comment_221028" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T16:06:56+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  4:06PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a sidenote, if that is a design goal, maybe take away the Detective's power to nail down the threat size.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221032/#Comment_221032" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T16:35:24+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  4:35PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I hope to challenge the extreme notion that a GM who alters game mechanical elements on the fly is (always) doing something bad.</blockquote>\nI'm sure you don't want to make the game some kind of manifesto or put in a lot of theory discussion, but you may want to put in some note, rather like what you just wrote (the full post), into the game so people understand that fudging's okay and encouraged.

Danger too low?  The players pour on the Danger dice and/or facilitate by rolling that d4 and trying out something their character is dangerously and comically bad at!  Disasters spinning out of control?  The GM decides that Elite Threat was actually a Major Threat, and she does it with all the players knowing up front that it's a choice she may have made.<br/><br/>Second, it's not as though the players will have pored over their characters to create the perfect tactical combination or have made really difficult tactical decisions along the way.  To me it feels like a game where you're there to serve the narrative, not waver over which Threat to take on.  Of course Andrew Mentum leaps to the attractive socialite's aid rather than attacking a Crimson Ape.

I'd be inclined to simplify things down as far as possible, and then simplify some more :-)<br/><br/>Scrap all bonuses for Styles and Roles as they stand, and eliminate all powers. Start with a clean(ish) sheet.<br/><br/>Styles. Each one has a one line description of your attributes or abilities (Psychic - You have amazing powers of the mind, Two-Fisted - You have nothing but courage and fortitue, Robot - You have a mighty mechanical body, etc). You can spend a Power Token to get a bonus die if you narrate an aspect of your style into your action ("I charge the enemy soldiers relying on my Robot Body to protect me from their fire!")<br/><br/>Roles. You get a bonus die when dealing with certain kinds of threats, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9760&amp;page=2#Comment_220759" rel="nofollow">as described here</a>. So the detective gets a bonus when dealing with The Law, a Commando when fighting multiple opponents, and so on. All roles get four bits of equipment, as currently described.<br/><br/>Powers. All Styles get four Powers. All Roles get two Powers. There are only six types of Power:<br/><br/>Attack, Defence, Move, Intimidate, Discover, Assist<br/><br/>The special effect for each one depends on the Role or Style, but the mechanical effects are the same. So A Robot's Attack is its built-in weaponry, whilst that of the Psychic is a mental blast. The Commando's Attack could be laying down a vicious fusilade of fire. Attack could always do 3 hits on a threat, Defence reduce a hit and give a bonus die, Move allow you to get from A to B instantly, and so on.<br/><br/>You could have the same power twice (A Robot Commando may have attack on both halves of their sheet, for example). If so you get to use it twice if you spend two Power tokens.<br/><br/>I confess that the mechanics of this whole approach are still fuzzy in my mind (using Move twice, for example), but the aim is to keep them simple, and force the detail from game effects into narration and player description.<br/><br/>I like things to be simple :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223599/#Comment_223599" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T00:20:49+00:00" title="August 10, 2009 12:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The existing powers already seem to inspire plenty of narration, and I think Danger Patrol does benefit from a mix of crunchiness and, er, um, smoothness.<br/>I think it's better to have many varying effects, as long as you avoid the "this power is clearly the best so I'll always take that and use it exclusively" syndrome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
