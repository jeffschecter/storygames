The GM is steeped in RobinLaws-ism and tends towards putting story ahead of everything. I'm not unhappy with that mindset at all, but we've been struggling a bit with the fudging thing.<br/><br/>We were in an underground beehive fighting Giant Mutant Devil Bees. We rolled some massive dice pools but kept getting 19s and 18s, while the GM kept rolling 20s and beating us by a hair. The amount of whiff was uncanny. It didn't help that, for every bee we killed, another one appeared in its place. In the end our level 1 party of 5 people had fought 5 bees, each level 2.<br/><br/>After the third flurry and about 4 hours spread across two sessions, we broke off and peeled out of there. After the session the GM admitted to fudging quite a bit to the PCs benefit (i.e. reporting lower numbers than he actually rolled) and that if this had been a more traditional game, he would've fudged even more because of his incredible luck.<br/><br/>Why did he do it? Simple: because he wanted us to have fun, and getting our asses handed to us by a bunch of goon bees didn't sound like fun to him.<br/><br/>In actuality, what happened was this:\n<ul>\n<li>Everyone had misunderstood the rules about fact stating. The rule is, when you get successes, each success translates into a Fact you can state about the fiction. The <i>losing</i> side will now narrate how those Facts came to be. We played this in reverse - when a player or GM succeeded, they just narrated something which contained some Facts. This means that the PCs, who tended to be on the losing side, never got narration rights and thus couldn't do anything in the fiction to prevent the ass-whupping from continuing.</li>\n<li>The fudging resulted in fewer successes for the baddies, which resulted in less extreme results. Had more extreme results been allowed to happen, the combat would've been over sooner - which would've indicated to the GM that this group of characters are not well-built enough, and their players aren't skilled enough, to handle 5x level 2 baddies on their own. It also would've gotten us back on track sooner, resulting in less "lost" actual playtime. The system wouldn't have killed us - it's just not lethal enough - and if it had, new characters are quick and easy to roll up.</li>\n</ul>\nDonjon is a very whiffy system. Much like Sorcerer (whose system is pretty much shares) it doesn't seem very concerned with accurate modelling of reality or even a gameable, predictable system. Rather, its mechanics give you unexpected results you have to deal with, and results which inform both fiction and mechanics in tangible ways. By compensating for the whiff through fudging instead of following the procedures of play to the letter, I believe our GM actually inadvertently prevented the story from proceeding instead of allowing it to proceed in the direction the system was pointing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247877/#Comment_247877" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T13:55:46+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  1:55PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, right, the actual question: Hmm.

I ran 4E for 2 groups who have never roleplayed before and another group who played 2E and Vampire.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ran several pre-made official Wizard encounters. I started with easy encounters and only scaled up when people became comfortable. The problem was that sometimes the easy encounters were deadly and the hard encounters were a breeze.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe encounters also seemed designed for maximum boredom. Monsters with high defenses so players whiffed a lot and waste their special daily powers, high hit points so combats would take forever, and monsters generally dealt small amount of damage making the players feel un-threatened until some mixture of condition combos, terrain, and luck quickly escalated the encounter to total party kills.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I fudged the dice frequently and adjusted hit points, defenses, and damage on the fly, these problems went away. I'm ok with fudging when people are learning to play or the group decides collectively to alter the game to customize it to our needs. So after they were all comfortable, I stopped fudging and let them know what I did fudge (they knew I was going to adjust the game on the fly to start).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we played minus fudging, it sucked. Everyone was frustrated. Having someone miss 5 times in a row over a 1-2 hour time span, literally doing nothing was more than ridiculous. But no one wanted to go back to fudging. A lot of these people played heroclix, magic, and video games. They felt if the games was so inconsistent, why bother. There were other games we could play. I left it up to them what level of difficulty we would play at. Same level, lower level, or higher level. This difference often felt inconsequential. It was way too random.<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely feel the system was directly at fault.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247915/#Comment_247915" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T17:17:17+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  5:17PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 9:51PM by johnzo.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Couple weeks ago at 4E, I rolled 15 dragon breath to-hits and hit with two of them.  Looking back, I wish I'd fudged those in my own favor.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>Last real fudge?  I roll dice out in full view so I can't fudge the classic way.  But a few weeks ago, I presented an encounter centered around an Eladrin Twilight Incanter and a cunningly laid-out fortress.  Our fey pal was set up to inflict some sweet badness with his at-will teleport bolt, popping the PCs into a set of inescapable birdcages.  He wanted them to kidnap their friend's baby for him, and figured they'd be easier to negotiate with if they were all in those cages.<br><br>So I'm locked and loaded -- but when the time came to pull the trigger on the plan, I blinked.  Some impulse told me that the encounter would be more gripping, fun, and appropriately challenging if the teleport bolt were a Recharge 4+ instead of an at-will.   So I nerfed my own guy, downgrading his power.<br><br>And it sucked ass.  The first teleport shot imprisoned the warlord, who got to watch the whole encounter, occasionally using a ranged power when the action moved in range of his cage.  And then the power failed to recharge until the last round, when it was too late, so I was unable to bring the encounter to the quick, decisive conclusion I'd originally envisioned and wound up with the degenerate case I specifically designed around, where 1-2 players would be bored in cages.<br><br>Lesson learned: in a challenge-based game, don't tinker with carefully designed encounters because of some weird spasm that says that the players can't handle it.

Otherwise you don't know for what purpose you're making any decisions at all. Virtually all roleplaying games with a GM have a section where they tell you what the GM does. That's guidelines.<br/><br/>But fudging isn't just "disregarding rules". In fact, "the rules" often include fudging as an explicit power of the GM. In fact, isn't that what that whole Dragon Age hootenanny was about? Doesn't everyone come around every few hours or weeks or whatever to pummel "Rule Zero" over and over with sticks, gleeful in their virtue? Of course they do. And those rules are written!<br/><br/>Plus, what if I've rolled the same NPC's skill 500 times and decide, on the 501st, that it's far too high and needs to be much lower?  Surely that's fudging, even if I decide to do this between sessions?<br/><br/>That is all nitpickery, I agree. Here is the nut:<br/><br/>I am doing something when I make a character in nWoD have 5, 50, or 500 XP.  I can give them however many I want, according to the rules. There are some guidelines ("50 XP is an established, moderately powerful character" type of thing).  What I do when I set up an NPC in nWoD is not really any different from a GM who rolls behind a screen, doesn't look at it and says "you succeed", insofar as the rules say we can do that kind of thing and they both create the same in-play outcome.  Of course there are many situations and groups for which one is acceptable and the other not, or neither acceptable, or both are acceptable, so if you want to define one as fudging and the other as not, and just say "fudging simply cannot happen before play, that is definitionally impossible", that's fine, but I think what's at stake here is <i>arbitrariness,</i> and that can happen anytime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247993/#Comment_247993" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T23:39:36+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 11:39PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 11:40PM by Moreno R..">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am losing track of the specific examples used in both thread, so maybe JD is no longer talking about DitV.

After that I tried Harnmaster and CoC "by the rules" without fudging, no matter what happened (but I still used a lot of illusionist techniques to save the players in CoC, as for example having the monster always eat the NPC first).

Here's what I see:<br/><br/>(note that this is just a metaphor, not exaggerating the discussion/argument to make a point, this is charitable and all)<br/>lacheck: When was the last time you ate dessert?<br/>(everyone talks about the one time they ate cake)<br/>JD: I eat pie ALL THE TIME.<br/>Judd: Sorry, when I said "eat dessert" I was just talking about eating cake.<br/>JD: But pie is dessert. It's just as much a dessert as cake. If you're talking about dessert, you have to recognize pie and creme brulee as well!<br/>Andy: OH MY GOD IT IS SO SO SWEET AND SO GOOD AND I HAVE DIABEETUS NOW.<br/><br/>So, the above distinction is a worthwhile discussion. I'll take it to a new thread within the hour, time permitting, because it's worth a civil look into. I definitely think that there's something to fudging the dice roll; and yet I also agree that changing stats of NPCs in rules-shifty ways (via pre-session prep or during the session) are in fact fudging as well: Just fudging the system instead of just the dice. I was positing yesterday that you could probably "fudge a setting" as well, as bizarre as that sounds, and that we probably do it all the time with impunity.<br/><br/>For now, just to keep a clear focus, <b>let's keep this thread about the last time you fudged on the dice</b>.

It seems pretty obvious to me that the term "fudging" is at its most useful when it's used for intentional breaks with the game's procedures in an effort to improve the experience. Under this definition Judd's dice-cheating is clearly fudging, while Jason's pregenerated NPCs are not. More significantly, we'll note that while a rules-set can give its blessing to fudging, it can't really change the fact that the fudge is always a break in the normal procedures of playing the game. I wrote about this in the other thread, I think - the reason for why I find cheating at dice annoying is that it leaves everything in the game up to my fiat instead of providing legitimate procedures. Whether the rules permit me to fudge is a secondary concern - if they don't, then I'm breaking trust, but if they do, I might still be breaking trust (with the games that advocate lying to the players, like the new Warhammer), or I might just be playing a badly designed game that has an unfun procedural break in it, forcing me to exercise fiat in random points. It's inefficient design, pure and simple.<br/><br/>(A word more on those pregenerated WoD NPCs: while they are not fudging in any way I understand the term, they are a sign of pretty primitive auteuristic GMing. Predetermining which conflicts PCs can win and which they can't is not usually something I consider fun. This is again a design issue, of course, but a different one; just like fudging, I just don't find it fun to waste time creating NPCs for the sole purpose of telling the other players what happens in the game. If that's the game I want to play, I'll execute it without the boring NPC-building step. I guess that ironically fudging would be my chosen vehicle for that kind of thing: I'd just pretend that I have NPC stats, while in fact I'd just decide on the spot which dice rolls the players are allowed to succeed in. Much less work.)<br/><br/>Even if the above seems contrary, at least it should be pretty clear that the reason for why people criticize Rule Zero and other fudge-tastic rules text in games is that they don't like the procedural feel of having to hobble along with the GM constantly supporting the system when it falls down in his judgment. Some folks don't seem to mind this design feature, while for others it's like a red flag.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248027/#Comment_248027" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T07:26:16+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  7:26AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>For now, just to keep a clear focus,<b>let's keep this thread about the last time you fudged on the dice</b>.

(The target number that most of the characters needed to hit required them to roll around 10-12 for this relatively simple challenge.) Her bad luck continued to grow into more and more of an outlier. I could tell she was getting frustrated. She started to dislike the game. She started to dislike the other players' ease at rolling 11s and 13s when she couldn't get above an 8. Soon she had failed 9 times in a row. For those playing along at home there is around a .3% chance (the decimal is not an accident) that someone could suffer such a run of bad luck. So the next time she rolled, and got a 7, I decided that the monster she was attacking was suffering morale loss as a result of the other monsters getting killed (by the other characters) and that a 7 was exactly what she needed to hit it. She ended the combat still "down", having established her character's bad luck as thoroughly as either of us could have desired, but without feeling like she was a complete drag on the party who would have contributed more by not showing up at all.  Thus the fudging was a complete success at helping the game and angering the Internet shadow puppets. (And also note that in 99.7% of these situations, D&amp;D's rules would have worked just fine to accomplish what we both wanted.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248060/#Comment_248060" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T09:23:28+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  9:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jason.

I'm also pleased as punch to admit that similar things happen at my own table at a not-inconsiderable frequency.<br/><br/>That this is fudging is hard to deny. However, the <i>motivation</i> seems considerably different than the motivations for fudging most opponents take issue with.

Part of it is that D&amp;D has moved towards scenarios that require success to be fun. Part of it is that the long odds scenario in Burning Wheel was a single die roll, the long odds sequence in D&amp;D was a string of bad luck over a period of time.<br/><br/>Perhaps the question is how to we do scenario prep for D&amp;D such that a string of bad luck can still be fun? Is it really the mechanics at fault or the way they are applied and how the GM and players weave the fiction from the results? I've read about Burning Wheel games with strings of bad luck (both for the group as a whole, and for individuals), yet the games are clearly still fun. I've run old school games where strings of bad luck have appeared to be fun, and have created fun stories to tell. Perhaps it was because I wrapped fiction around the increasingly improbable strings of bad luck. Of course my view of their fun is biased by being in the GM chair for those, yet other strings of bad player luck have been just as unfun for me (or honestly I think even some times more unfun for me).<br/><br/>I have fudged to keep things moving. I have fudged to avert a TPK (or near TPK). I have occasionally even fudged to save an individual PC (where I had a concern about the player). On the other hand, I have been complimented before on letting the dice fall where they may and generate spectacular failures.<br/><br/>I haven't completely dodged fudging in recent history, though one thing I have done is involved the whole group in the decision more and more. That helps soften the negative affect, but still, I think something is wrong that there is a need to avoid the TPK.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248067/#Comment_248067" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T09:48:13+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  9:48AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my part, I do pretty much mean exactly what Jason describes there when I speak of fudging. That's a classical example, in fact - the rules system fails the group's expectations as interpreted by the GM to such a degree that he would rather break the system than see the situation to its logical conclusion.<br/><br/>The conclusion I'd draw from this phenomenon is not that fudging is good, though. My conclusion is that the rules system sucks and GMs defending the practice suffer from some sort of Stockholm syndrome after having had to arbitrate between a bad game and their group for too long. I don't find this an unreasonable point of view; swap to a system that ensures a minimum of heroic competence for player characters, and there's no reason to fudge to achieve the effect. Do the same for all other reasons you might have to fudge, and voila, you have a system where fudging has no place.<br/><br/>(Not saying that a particular text of D&amp;D is a bad game, note. It's just that the exact sort of thing Jason describes is something D&amp;D is quite bad at, so we can say that it's a "bad game" for keeping Jason's wife happy. The sort of situation Jason mentions would be taken as a matter of course by a different group that accepted the vagaries of random distributions and used that as a springboard for play - that sort of group wouldn't have a need for fudging in that situation, as they would use the rules set in a different way, to play a different game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248069/#Comment_248069" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T09:53:11+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  9:53AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2009 9:53AM by lachek.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (reply to Frank) First off we can look at the different ways the players perceive the systems. In John's case, he obviously has absolute faith in BW as a system to bring awesome stories into being. Who is he to question the validity of the outcome? But in the case of Jason and his wife, they can see plain-as-day that D&amp;D is stacked to let the players win and gain renown, magical items, and XP, yet it failed spectacularly to deliver.<br/><br/>Secondly, all the things you mention in the first paragraph is totally true. The outcome of a single roll, in particular, is difficult to be resentful of. A long string of bad luck is harder to take in stride.<br/><br/>Lastly, I make a clear distinction between games where each dice roll creates a change in equilibrium, and those where each dice roll simply means the difference between "change" and "no change". I much prefer the former to the latter to the degree that I consider it to be plainly better design to have each roll result in something tangible. This is not quite the difference between "conflict" and "task" resolution, as you can have a task resolution system featuring contested rolls. DnD falls squarely in the latter category, however - many rolls, frequently more than half, will result in nothing but a "miss". This can be extremely dull in play, as no amount of free narration will help a game which does not progress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248074/#Comment_248074" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T09:59:04+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  9:59AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, do you find the fact that Jason grounded his fudging in the fiction (the monsters have a morale penalty due to being slaughtered) to be of interest at all, compared to if he'd just arbitrarily changed the result and declared it a hit?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248078/#Comment_248078" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T10:23:32+00:00" title="December 22, 2009 10:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2009 10:29AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I wrote about this in the other thread, I think - the reason for why I find cheating at dice annoying is that it leaves everything in the game up to my fiat instead of providing legitimate procedures. </blockquote>\nIs this a "slippery slope" thing?

I grabbed some NPCs from the back of a setting book and copied their stats for a group of foes for the PCs, then quickly realized they were going to mop the floor with the PCs after a round or so of die rolling.  So, I dropped their stats quickly, fudged a few rolls, let some people hit opponents and wrapped up the combat quickly.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I could have handled it differently.  <br/>* I could have let the dice fall where they may and let the party get walloped and rolled that into a new story.<br/>* I could have stopped the combat, apologized to the players and ditched it entirely.<br/><br/>But I felt, in the moment, that letting it slip that I had been too lazy to prep and create a fair and balanced combat was less desirable than faking and fudging my way past it.  I realize there is a playstyle where the players can and will run into tougher opponents and it is their responsibility to recognize and react to that situation.  I don't play that way.  I usually play games with player characters as heroes and with failure an obstacle to create a more interesting story.  Much like Eero says, I now look for systems that don't need fudging.  But, sometimes I end up running games that my playgroup WANTS to play.  And those games are set up to push my playstyle into a fudging type of situation from time to time.  It isn't optimal, it isn't my first choice.

I've skimmed it and plan to read it all, though.<br/><br/>Now, my answer.  I try not to fudge.  Usually it's not even possible because we don't normally play games with GM screens, so everyone can see what everyone rolls.  However, for the last about 9 months I've been running an nWoD game and I have been using a screen. I may have fudged (by which I mean reporting a result that the dice didn't indicate) a couple times in that time, but I'm not sure.  I still try to avoid it, and if I did it, it wasn't a significant enough event that it stuck in my memory.  It's also usually unnecessary for me to fudge because I don't usually make up NPCs ahead of time.  Unless the PCs are up against someone who was major enough that I bothered to stat them up, or they're up against something with a stat block published in a book, I'm basically just grabbing dice or assigning numbers on the fly.  I say to myself "This guy has a.... let's say 3 Defense."  Or "I think this guy's pretty keen so I'll give him an awareness pool of 6 to spot the hiding PC."  I think this is sort of fudging in a way, but no more so than when a game calls for the GM to arbitrarily assign target or difficulty numbers, I guess.  I'm making things easier or harder based on how I "feel" it would be most interesting, but I'm not coming down from on high to completely determine outcomes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248095/#Comment_248095" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T11:03:39+00:00" title="December 22, 2009 11:03AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>That's a good question.

If a game system has a 0.3% rate of failing on a single roll, it's not the same as saying that that game system work fine 99.7% of the times. Because a game system is NOT used on SINGLE ROLLS. A game system works of a succession of rolls during the game.  (think about your car: if the motor would break "only" every 0.3% of piston cycle...  meaning after a few seconds, with hundred of cycles at second... you would consider it "fine" and "not broken"?)<br/><br/>The next part is superfluous. Everybody here know, for personal experience, how frequently many "traditional" game systems need fudging rolls to work. But this is a Internet forum, so sometimes it's necessary to pull out numbers from an hat to give an aura of "fact" to something everybody already know but don't want to admit. Let's say you have (for the sake of discussion) a six player party. How many rolls for every player during a game session? I don't know, there is people who say, proudly, that they never roll dice in their D&amp;D session, but this simply mean that the system is already failing them, so let's say for the sake of the example that every player rolls 50 times every session. 300 times for the entire group.  And see how many chances you have to EVEN A SINGLE SESSION without that system giving you problems and breaking down on you.<br/><br/>It's not a question of percentages. The percentages of a "traditional" rpg game breaking down are unbelievably high. It's a matter of expectations: in this hobby, we are trained to have none. To consider "normal" a game system failure. Even "a good thing", because it differentiate a "good GM" from the "Bad GMs" that are not able to save the game from these failures...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Ya wanna know what this same group's success rate was with Primetime Adventures?

If you do, then you need to evaluate situations for fudging, and you might need to invent play conditions that allow you to execute the fudging gracefully (GM screens and such). So the upkeep of the fudging potential is a certain sort of drain for me in my GM role, which makes it preferable for me to play a game that does not include fudging as an option.<br/><br/>Just for the sake of understanding, compare: one game is built to assume that player characters win all of their combats, but it also involves a combat system that essentially randomizes winning and losing in small increments (hit points, say). Another game is built to assume that player characters win all of their combats, so its combat system, such as it is, measures time spent in the fight instead of how much you win or lose. A third game assumes that characters might win or might lose, has an incrementally random system (the same one game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> has, let's say). It seems pretty obvious to me that the only one of these games where you'll actually need to fudge the results of the combat system is the first one, as those results work at cross-purposes with the assumption that player characters are going to win all combats. Why on Earth would somebody consider this as a feature of design instead of a flaw? You could play game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, which removes the potential of PC defeat, or game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, which provides the tools for handling both defeat and victory. Playing the one game that requires you to fudge doesn't seem sane to me, I don't understand the rationale behind the decision.<br/><br/>And even with that said, if you still end up playing a game that requires fudging for it to work (people work in mysterious ways, plenty of reasons for a person to end up playing a suboptimal game), then do fudge by all means. Jason, for instance, seems to live in a gaming landscape where he simply doesn't have games that'd fit the capabilities and goals of his group well enough for them to function without fudging. It's definitely a net positive that he still cares enough to continue GMing in that situation. It's no skin off my nose if he thinks that fudging is normal and a good thing, I just happen to disagree based on my own, different experience. I should think that my own experience is sufficient proof for the fact that I can be quite happy without ever fudging a dice roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248111/#Comment_248111" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T12:58:31+00:00" title="December 22, 2009 12:58PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2009 4:44PM by johnzo.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite>Part of it is that the long odds scenario in Burning Wheel was a single die roll, the long odds sequence in D&amp;D was a string of bad luck over a period of time.</blockquote>\nThanks for contrasting those posts, Frank.<br/><br/>We play both MG and 4E at our weekly table, and I'm the DM of the 4E game.  I really like how MG makes the single roll ('test' in Mouse-language) meaningful.  Tests are rare, you have to earn them before you can spend them, they are unbounded in terms of fictional time or fictional impact, and they are <i>decisive</i>.  There are no takebacks.  A test is like typing COMMIT on your fiction.<br/><br/>A low-resolution / high-decisiveness philosophy makes it much easier to make failure interesting.  If you're some dude rolling to pick a lock, then failure is ... uh ... the lock is not picked.  But if you're a whole team of people rolling once on a days-long attempt to infiltrate a prison and spirit a condemned ally away, that's a fail cornucopia.  Was the team discovered?  Was the team too slow?  Did they have to watch the ally's execution?  Was their intelligence so bad that they picked the wrong prison entirely?  Are guys from the team now in custody?  Did the ally get tired of waiting and start talking about the team's secrets in an attempt to save his own skin?<br/><br/>(It also makes it much easier to plan scenarios, since your setting can be impressionistic instead of defined.  But that's another post.)<br/><br/>I'm trying to import this LR/HD into the 4E game.  The trouble here is that the system uses massive die-roll repetition to try to impose some predictability on the rogue  d20.  My current idea, outside of combat, is to never require more than one primary check to surmount a single obstacle, and to try to come up with obstacles that are provocative enough to inspire good failures.

You just happen to call one of the tools to deal with success or failure "fudging" and I see all those tools as equal. For some reason you're singling out the judgment of a person at the table as the one tool that nobody ought be permitted to use, whose use is the signifier of a badly designed game.  The judgment of a person at the table is not a broken tool! It is in fact something everyone who comes to the table has.

I was emphasizing the "always win" goal in Eero's formulation, or maybe assuming it where it was unwarranted. If we take 'player characters always win' as a goal, there are still good reasons to choose the system where failure is possible. For one thing, it might be important to codify how others in the game world lose, or perhaps the rewards for winning are much more robust and interesting in the third game than in the first. As with everything else in the toolbox, judgment might help with that.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that I don't see why someone's judgment is somehow an unjustifiable, illegitimate gaming tool (rather than just one that some people don't like, in the same way other people don't like die pools or naked ladies on the cover of their books).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248122/#Comment_248122" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T13:31:19+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  1:31PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero explained that pretty well, I thought.

Also, a game written to be used with fudging, but without specifying where and why it is to be used, is badly written. Furthermore, even a game that cares enough to explain where, why and how you're supposed to use fudging can be a pretty awful thing - not in any logically absolute manner, but as a simple aesthetic judgment on my part. For example, I don't find the new Warhammer a very fun game. It is theoretically defensible, but even then I'm almost certain that nigh-on anybody will be better served by either scrapping the rulebook and only using the GM guide, or vice versa - the two parts are only usable together by wilfully engaging in an elaborate ritual of pretend-play wherein grand game-mechanical structures are pre-empted consistently by GM fiat. That sort of thing can theoretically serve a purpose, but only if we assume that the gaming group gets their rocks off by a combination of ritual pretense and GM-authored storytelling.<br/><br/>(I just read the Warhammer rules a couple of days ago, which is why I'm using it as an example. The GM book includes lengthy treatises on why and where the GM should fudge. It's very logical and easy to follow, and rather insane from where I'm standing - why the fuck am I supposed to waste all that time picking the right powers for my dude if the GM's job is explicitly to ensure that whatever I do, the outcome is that my character triumphs after great struggle?)<br/><br/>But still, most of that is my own preference, experience and understanding, which doesn't particularly need to be justified. My experience is that fudging is boring and stressful, because it only makes sense in a context wherein I'm responsible for actively overriding the game we're playing to ensure that everybody has a good time. This is almost a polar opposite of what I find interesting in games: a good game should be structured to provide clear choices, oracular supports, interaction and interesting constraints for creativity. Fudging is none of these, it's just a nasty glitch that pops up when the game is ill-designed and needs to be hacked on the spot to allow it to continue. I don't know if there is anything more for me to say on the matter.<br/><br/>I guess I can see how somebody who is not me can enjoy fudging - as I speculated above in relation to the new Warhammer rpg, it seems like fudging is a fine tool for exercising GM fiat: you have an outcome you want, and you're going to get it even if it means breaking the game arbitrarily. I guess that if you find your goals more important than the rules of the game you're playing, then this makes sense. It's been a long time since I've had that sort of creative drive going into a game, though; nowadays I just go with the flow and work within the system and its goals, swapping games if a given game doesn't suit for what the group wants to do. I also find it a peculiar attitude to have meta-goals like that in playing a game.<br/><br/>Setting aside my own preferences, In the end the only illegitimacy I can find in fudging is that I'm not convinced that it has a healthy purpose in fulfilling gaming goals. Every example of fudging that I've seen seems to me like they're just the result of a flawed game design (flawed in relation to what the given group is trying to make the game do). Even GMs who swear by fudging as the only reliable way of running games mostly seem to me like they're just deluding themselves about the necessity of a physical-model rules system; if you just drop the act and stop rolling dice where the outcome is already determined by GM fiat, then there's no need to fudge. If you think that the players need to roll dice and feel like there's an impartial rules system controlling the game (this is what the Warhammer GM's guide says), is that really a healthy motivation? You're essentially saying that the best way to entertain the players is by lying to them about the internal workings of the game they're playing. That's a quite interesting claim, and I find it a shame that we don't get more people in the real world, outside GM guide sections of rpg books, defending this viewpoint. Lying to make the game better, really?<br/><br/>Seems to me that the only way to accept fudging as a valid design solution is to posit a game where the players are gaining value from the rules set even while it is only advisory for the GM, who is supposed to override the system any time it gives outcomes that do not serve his goals. Is this a reasonable position? It might be, but I've never enjoyed games like that. It seems like uneconomical design to me, to first build a rules system and then declare that anything the system does has to be vetted by the GM anyway. It's a lot of hassle, dice-rolling and immersion-breaking for the players just to create advisory data for the GM to use in his decision-making; total freeform seems much cleaner in this regard - you could even have the GM run some dice-rolling oracles if he really needs those to arrive at his decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248132/#Comment_248132" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T14:20:52+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  2:20PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2009 2:36PM by Andy.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>I tried to post a response to this thread, and the system destroyed it, because my sign-in had expired.</blockquote>\nHeya, this shouldn't be happening.

Just "fudge if you want" is as bad as "roll dice if you want" is as bad as "narration-pass if you want" is as bad as just saying "use any technique if you want". There is virtually no effort in any game published in any context that makes any effort at all to have people identify what they want.  If they do, it's usually not past "hey, talk about what you want a lot", which is super mega terrible and only better than the usual nothing that we get.<br><br>So let's agree on that.  But somehow people eventually do figure out what they want. Without that step there's no basis for fudging being justified - or any other technique, for that matter. Nothing will work unless people want something, and/or know what they want.  And eventually, somehow, groups learn what they collectively want, which is not the same as knowing what they individually want.  They've got a super sweet spot where they get and give exactly what they want, they've got some broader, more nebulous area where some people are getting what they want, and some new things that they're unsure about but are willing to give it a try, or things they're willing to tolerate to get what they want, and further beyond that there's an area of things that only one person wants, or things they don't like at all but may grit their teeth and get through if they get something really awesome later, and beyond that is the wide world of everything in gaming they hate. <br/><br/>Some groups are super picky. They have a really narrow target they're shooting at. Some groups are promiscuous. They'll be happy no matter what you do. Most people have a mixture of preferences, some super specific, some very broad, some extremely set-in-stone, others more flexible and trade-off-y. And virtually all important gaming preferences change moment to moment, session to session, year to year, I hope I do not desire the same things from gaming today as I did when I was 15, or when you were.<br/><br/>If a designer is trying to design for a lot of groups that 1) know what they want, but who nevertheless 2) want very different things from each other and/or different things than what they wanted an hour ago, then fudging is not just a highly justified tool in the toolbox, I argue that it's virtually the only thing that can keep a game functioning among all those different groups.<br/><br/>By the by, I strongly disagree that fudging is based only on physics-based systems. It's the outcome that you're jumping to. What you're jumping over is just not relevant.<br/><br/>Just to step sideways a minute: What about action/drama point mechanics?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248172/#Comment_248172" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T17:54:41+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  5:54PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting view. I agree with you that fudging is a good idea if your goal is to set up a game that allows a wide variety of different groups with different interests to play the game. However, assuming that this happens at the expense of the game's performance quality (which it does to my mind, as I don't like fudging), what's the point in siding with the Man and defending something that is not going to improve your experience as an individual gamer? In other words: does fudging have some other virtue aside from it being a flexible tool and therefore a good stopgap for a lazy designer? Because if that's it, then fudging is only going to be useful for those who haven't found an actually functional game to play and have to settle for a drifted version of some barely fitting game. Like playing D&amp;D for dramatic purposes, say.<br/><br/>I would actually consider that a pretty fair assessment, now that I think about it - fudging might well be favoured as a design rhetoric by a certain sort of '90s game company exactly because it allows you to write a game and start pushing out sourcebooks, all the while pretending that everybody playing the game is playing the same game. In actuality the various golden rules only ensure that a wide variety of <i>different</i> games are played with ostensibly the same rules set. So the financial motivation is clearly there, but that doesn't mean that fudging is a good idea for us as gamers.<br/><br/>Saying that fudging is necessary because games cannot be made functional among many different groups without it is essentially conceding defeat as game designers and saying that freeforming is the best solution - this very same argument goes double for not having a rules set at all, as that allows for the ultimate in flexibility. In practice I think we'll find that people are happy enough to be flexible and play to the strengths of the games they are offered. Some rather narrow games seem to find their players easily enough, and require no fudging. Something like <i>My Life with Master</i>, say - if picky, individual tastes were a paramount measure of successful gaming, then how many people could we really expect to be able to play this game according to its rules? In reality it seems like there are hundreds of people who've done so and had fun - I personally know of around 50 here in Finland, and that's just the ones that I've heard of.<br/><br/>Also, fudging doesn't seem to me like it's the only or even the best solution for the problem of adapting a game to a given group's desires. Instead of fudging we might modify the rules, for instance. It's pretty fair to say that modifying the rules to make the game perform might be harder to do, but the result would also be more consistent and fun (for me, as I don't like to fudge). Therefore we might characterize fudging as something that should only be done if it is too difficult to change the game to better accord with the group's desires.

There's also the fundamental difference of "my good friends are here to have fun with some game or another" and "here's this game, who's interested in playing it".<br/><br/>Our "group" plays both traditional-style games and more focused-design story-style games (I hate terminology - you know what I mean). "Group" is in scarequotes because it's more of a pool of a dozen or so players. Literally everyone have wildly differing needs and expectations. It is simply impossible for me to say "Oh lookie here, I have this copy of Best Friends - let's play that next" to a group who just came off DnD 4E. Rather, if I want to play it my best bet is to say "Okay, look, I want to play Best Friends. Here's the pitch and the caveats. Anyone else interested?" This yields me a group of players who have bought into the theme, concept and mechanics of Best Friends, rather than a group of people with pre-determined notions of the techniques and procedures of play and what they'll get out of it, requiring me to put on a song and dance so they won't feel let down.<br/><br/>Or not. Most of the time my pitches fall flat and the game continues to sit there on the shelf. That's fine, too - better, in my mind, than me having to wrangle with system design while under pressure at the table to ensure all players are fully satisfied.<br/><br/>Sometimes I wish I could get Adam, Beatrice, Charles and Dagny in the same room together, have them explain to me what they'd like to do and experience, and put together a rule system on the fly using some generic rules that'd let them enjoy themselves. In that situation, I'd totally conveniently forget to apply certain rules sometime, misapply them other times, or bump the table with a grin when someone loses a roll they really wanted to score. But I don't do that because it puts undue stress on me as a host for what amounts to merely an enjoyable social event - I'd rather supply freshly ground coffee and tasty snacks, and <i>not</i> game if I can't get Adam, Beatrice, Charles and Dagny to agree on what works for them.<br/><br/>Not everyone splits it down that line. Some members of our "group" has a third mode, which I can only describe as "I'd like to explore this setting/concept with this bunch of friends". They put the setting or conceit first, pitches that to the group of people they'd enjoy that exploration with, and thinks about system last of all. In play they tend to apply rules as they see fit - not change them per se, or alter dice rolls, but simply omit them if they feel they'd be distracting from the point of play at that time. Taken to its extreme this definitely leads to the "we played DnD and didn't roll dice at all, it was awesome" effect. I can't quite wrap my head around this approach myself.<br/><br/>Still, personal preference and conscious decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248248/#Comment_248248" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T07:40:35+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  7:40AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For this post, by fudging I mean fudging on the dice.<br/><br/>Basically, I don't like doing this.  For me, if it's not open it's the GM abrogating the chosen system's results in favour of his selected results, which tends to lead to GM-driven story, deprotagonisation and crying kittens.<br/><br/>If it is open, I prefer a mechanic for it, lest we fall into freeform diceless madness.  Drama points or whatever.  Oh, and everyone should get to do it.<br/><br/>Anyway, I do fudge on occasion.  Where I do so is when I have statted an encounter or opponent, but have made a mistake in doing so that doesn't become apparent until the dice hit the table.  We're playing, and my hardass mercenary turns out mechanically to be a wuss or my effete courtier turns out to be a bad-to-the-bone duellist.<br/><br/>Now, if I planned it that way, fair enough, but if I actually intended the courtier to be a wimp but due to my misunderstanding of the combat stats I've actually made him into Schwarzenegger, I'd then fudge.  The reason is to fix an error of my own making, a rules error committed during prep that isn't apparent until play.<br/><br/>If that happens more than once or twice, clearly I'm struggling with that ruleset, and will likely switch to another game.<br/><br/>Last time I remember fudging was with Heroquest.  I didn't understand from the book that a starting character was like a first level guy in D&amp;D, the term masteries for a start made me think characters were serious people.  The PCs created their characters, who by and large were portrayed as being experienced and competent people.  We started play, I used the resistances suggested in the book and the PCs had their asses handed to them in every encounter.  They were supposed to be experienced, but the dice said first level D&amp;D guy.  After a bit, I fudged every roll by the same factor to get the PCs to where we'd all intended them to be.  I didn't run HQ again though, I was too annoyed by the mismatch between game fiction and game mechanic that it created and the lack of clarity in the book's descriptions of how stuff worked (plus I hated bidding wars, which I understand aren't in the new edition).<br/><br/>Anyway, another data point for the thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248315/#Comment_248315" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T12:19:09+00:00" title="December 23, 2009 12:19PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><br/>I have a theory that fudging rolls, as used by old-school GMs, is actually a sophisticated narrative technique, used to give interesting color to success or failure.<br/></blockquote>\nThat's a really interesting point, and reminds me of one of my motivations for fudging when i used to do it. Often. a failed roll by a player in a boring situation was an opportunity to add drama and tension, by adding some extra details and asking for another roll. Before that failed roll occurred, I didn't know I was going to create those extra details, but often they took the game in new directions.<br/><br/>Of course I also had the, "I don't want my players to feel incompetent" motivation too (which is why I generally [refer to play systems that don't require fudging, or have system-limited forms of fudging built-in like drama points), but I do think moments of fudging were often moments of opportunity, opportunity to heighten suspense or introduce interesting narrations.<br/><br/>Interesting.

They've not thought through what may happen.  The dice roll, the result is unacceptable for the "GM's story", or would plainly be unacceptable to the group.  The GM fudges.<br/><br/>There's a few problems there though, firstly if a GM is fudging because otherwise the adventure can't continue, that suggests to me railroading is happening.  Secondly, the GM is abrogating the players' right to have an input on the result, if you want to roll the dice but there's a tiny chance of a dumb outcome - and that chance comes up, I think it would be better to openly say "let's ignore that", many old school GMs instead just fudge and so decide for the group which is problematic.<br/><br/>On the unacceptable outcome, the problem is again the GM's just assuming it's unacceptable, if they're fudging that is.  If it's a character death, perhaps the player would be fine with that.  Perhaps in fudging when characters die, the GM is leaching suspense from the game without realising (I've seen that tons of times, hell, in the past I've done it myself).  It's another kind of fudging for story, fudging to ensure things go as the GM envisaged.<br/><br/>I guess I'm suggesting it's not a sophisticated narrative technique, it's a very crude one which mostly serves to prioritise GM story concerns over group story concerns, by misleading the other participants as to the actual mechanics being applied at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248362/#Comment_248362" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T17:09:12+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  5:09PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2009 5:10PM by Graham.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, this is what I mean.<br/><br/>I played Traveller: we were infiltrating a spaceship, which had been hijacked by terrorists.<br/><br/>When we missed a roll by one, we would sometimes succeed, but get a negative consequence. We'd get through the door, but set the alarm off.<br/><br/>When we succeeded a roll, but only just, we would only just succeed.<br/><br/>When we missed a roll by a long way, we would seriously, seriously fail.<br/><br/>Although you could call this fudging, it seems to me that the system, as it was used at the table, was pretty sophisticated. It allowed for succeeding-but-with-a-consequence. In short, it did everything we do in indie games, but without explicitly naming it.<br/><br/>So, however much we talk down fudging, I think it's a pretty good technique when used well. I also think that we've developed a strawman idea of fudging, in which thousands of GMs shamefacedly ignore failed rolls. In fact, I think most GMs know what they're doing, and fudge die rolls in a pretty interesting way.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248371/#Comment_248371" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T18:03:40+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  6:03PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, it wouldn't have occurred to me to call that fudging to be honest.

And if you ask about fudging in that sense over on rpg.net or therpgsite (I grant the latter is an unlikely place for folk here to ask questions) then you'll generally find lots of people boasting about how they fudge or arguing that it's the GM's duty to fudge to avoid failure where it goes against the "story".<br/><br/>How representative those guys are is anyone's guess of course, but I don't think it's that rare.  Lots of game books openly advocate fudging failed rolls too, almost anything written by Robin Laws will generally say to ignore the results of rolls that get in the way of the GM's story, but not to tell the players.  In fact, that's why I think it's not a strawman, it's common GM advice and while nobody here probably even reads that stuff, newbies do.<br/><br/>Won't anyone think of the newbies?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248376/#Comment_248376" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T18:55:50+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  6:55PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Ah, it wouldn't have occurred to me to call that fudging to be honest</blockquote>\nI don't think I have ever eard anyone, until now, call that "fudging"...<br/><br/>It's happened, again.

There, rolling might be "hey, I'm teaching you this system you've never played in a safe environment" and the fudging is "welp, looks like that woulda killed you, see how you roll in this game? Okay, moving on."  The same is true of introductory scenarios and groups that are feeling their way through systems.

As I said in the other thread, "fudging" is effectively a blanket term for <i>whole families</i> of techniques that nobody ever talks about or writes down.<br/><br/>The problem isn't culturally valued words, it's in the fact that people need to talk about <i>what they're actually doing</i> instead of using jargon. Which requires <i>examining and thinking about</i> what they're actually doing, which a huge number of gamers (as evinced by RPGnet and the RPGSite) aren't interested in doing -- and may even become hostile at the suggestion that it might be fruitful to do so.<br/><br/>And it's a serious problem, because those whole families of techniques?
