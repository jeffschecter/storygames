Primarily what jumps to mind for me, after reading the rules and then listening to your impressions, is the use of hit points/health/psyche points which I find distracting and unpleasant in a LARP environment.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the highlighting player-empowerment rules was brilliant.

It sounded like y'all scanned the TOC, saw "Character Creation" and jumped to that... and got buried in confusion. Which I would expect because the whole book layout (again, just for the STD) is hyper front-loaded. In essence, the whole STD is a Glossary that steadily builds on previous terms.

The model of the mechanics is virtually identical, though highly streamlined for action-LARP-specific play. Further, No one would have had the cheek to try to take One-Legged x2 AND Ponderous:<br/>* One-Legged x2 = Can't walk (or stand, jump, or run).<br/>* Ponderous = Walk slow.<br/><br/>Obviously, Ponderous doesn't "actually increase the risk to the character or limit the character" that is already no-legged; so no Exp would have been granted for buying Ponderous. (Heh... Ponderous is even used in the example in the RAW of a disingenuous Defect purchase! LOL)<br/><br/>Also, being no-legged will make you an SC (as it says) and so you could only use Stare Attacks (which would have been prohibitively expensive in Exp). But hey, it's a concept!<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that I have every intention of building the book with more of a "start simple, build in detail" approach. But that will mean a LOT of repetition and cross-referencing, and I don't want to get to that level of verbiage when I'm still uncertain if all of the rules will stay in.

The practical outcome in combat is that it's very rare for Drain to impact speedy melee. It's kind of more like something folks sort out once the violence is ended (e.g., "Yeah, man, did you notice that Drain 2 the Lich hit you with, before you use Reserve to Restore Alacrity?").<br/><br/>And there's no 'soak Abilities' for Psyche, so it's just a stat. No defense, one offense (Scar). When you hear folks calling out "Shock!" in actual melee, then the tendency is for players to run into the woods!<br/><br/>So, yes, one must keep three "resources" in one's head to play fairly and react at the precise time when your character's situation would demand it. BUT... It's LARP. We KNOW folks miss math, don't feel hits, etc. Anyone with more than three weekends of LARP would just float past that vagueness. If shit gets totally pear-shaped, a GM calls a Hold and a short discussion ensues, followed by a restart (NOTE: Holy, cow! I didn't write Restart procedures!!)<br/><br/>And you might also notice that the physical resource has a lot of 'angles' from which it can be managed or bolstered... but the mental is more limited... and the emotional is bare-assed.

I was trying to figure out the best way to respond without sounding like the jerk I apparently am and was busy doing my own work. I'll respond to each point you made by number and marked the original points with a number for reference.<br/><br/>1. We actually read from page 1 to ending, then got confused and just looked for a place that made sense to start. We never tried to cheat the system to find the cliff notes first.<br/><br/>2. GURPS does have negative traits and we referred back to that frequently to explain our position on your game. The only experience I had with players using GURPS and other systems like that are ones that abused the system to find any bonus points they can and your current version of GLASS is rife with them. Don't even use my example because that is a common trick telepathic players did in games like GURPS. The only ways to remove abuse is with GM Fiat (which is usually too subjective), or clear limitations on character generation (like only have 3 negative traits, .etc)<br/><br/>3. A person can walk with their hands and there are crippled people who are able to move as a stump. Not far mind you, but can move and ponderous would explain everyone wrong with a person who didn't have any limbs. It is only with GM Fiat that prevents those negative traits from being taken, which goes back to my point in the podcast that this game relies on too much GM Fiat to be my kind of fun. I can still see the enjoyment that can happen though, so I'm not declaring it as garbage. I would just prefer actual guidelines beyond GM decides what is going too far. It allows for GM tyrants and that's no fun for anybody but the GM.<br/><br/>Again, sorry for the delay and I forward to talking about your game. Really consider having a limitation on quirks and a large portion of your game will fix itself since the system won't be able to be abused.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388572/#Comment_388572" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T09:02:49+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  9:02AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2012 9:36AM by David Artman.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again for the feedback!<br/><br/>I'm not sure what I can do to reduce GM Fiat, as the whole system is predicated on GMs totally customizing the genre and power levels, possibly even Packages and Templates, and only <i>rarely</i> letting players create abilities from scratch, with careful perusal of those with Warnings. In this way, it's basically like Hero System--one can do anything; but one rarely plays with anything available to anyone.<br/><br/>GLASS can never be a "fire and forget" system for LARP. A particular GLASS <i>Game Type</i> can be such, though; and it will resemble nothing so much as a bog-standard, points-buy, pick-list RPG (e.g., classes, races, professions, canonical abilities). Some game types might even be GMless (e.g., genres with no NPCs and no "line crawls" or similar prepared content--for example, a basic WWII war game type that's 100% PvP).<br/><br/>So I guess the best way I could make GLASS "your kind of fun" is to say, "OK, wait for complete GLASS-based game type rules to come out; and just buy the one or two genres that you'd play." And then grab shotGLASS (for free) so that you have the basic rules reference for procedures of play and effects (the game type will tell you what you can buy and how and with how many points; but, because my current CC license forbids reprinting any rule content in shotGLASS or GLASS, the game type won't have that basic stuff in it).<br/><br/>They should be available... before the end of the decade. :}                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388578/#Comment_388578" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T09:49:17+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  9:49AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2012 9:50AM by David Artman.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RE actual legless players walking on hands, and limbless players inchworming around.... Um... MAYBE I'll address that, in the discussion of Defects. But frankly, my inclination is to say that such a player would be at far too great a risk, in actual play (viz the Safe Characters rules, in general--they're built to protect BOTH disabled players AND the able players who might not notice someone below waist level.)<br/><br/>As for a PC that "simulates" being an arm-walker or inchworm... I'll give that some thought. It's pretty hard for verisimilitude, to have someone be "legless" but have no wheelchair and so they are standing there saying, "I'm actually on the ground, but that's unsafe to do all the time, so I'm standing here."<br/><br/>So, yeah... not Ponderous. Ponderous is, literally, for behemoths, zombies, etc--things that WALK, but do so very slowly.<br/><br/>In closing, it's a well-known rule of LARP design: no rule system can contain cheating or system-abusing players. Whether GMs are in the loop or not, players have to self-regulate (and regulate each other) constantly in LARP. Hell, if your LARPs whole rule set was contained by the rules for hide and seek, there'd still be some players going out of bounds, or picking a hiding place that only a very tall person can reach, or whatever. The beauty of LARP is that it self-regulates so well--cheaters and abusers eventually are known by the whole troupe, and IGNORED if they insist upon misengaging the rules (e.g., ignoring hits in combat: opponent just stops fighting, say, "I'm done with your cheating" and walks away; that happens often enough, no one engages with the cheater and they get bored and quit).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388600/#Comment_388600" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T12:43:44+00:00" title="August 28, 2012 12:43PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks again for the feedback!<br/><br/>I'm not sure what I can do to reduce GM Fiat, as the whole system is predicated on GMs totally customizing the genre and power levels, possibly even Packages and Templates, and only <i>rarely</i> letting players create abilities from scratch, with careful perusal of those with Warnings.

For me, the whole reducing GM Fiat means fixing the character creation so GM control isn't needed as much or at all. I understand that is what you asked of us when trying to break the system, but from what I noticed, the more specialized our characters were, it looked real easy to say, 'You can't that. That's too much cheese for your character.'<br/><br/>That was what I was getting at with a limitation of either limitations, or detailed explanations on how far you can go when designing your characters. Personally, I would chop up character generation and ability selection into two handouts or two sections instead of the way you have it now. That was a hint of what we were getting at when we dicussed the layout could use some work.<br/><br/>As far as my kind of fun, it wouldn't require the fixing of GM Fiat, just a very clear understanding of what my power is in the game because I'll be quick to tell a GM he's crossing the line if they abuse their power. After that, it looks nice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
