But I LOVE the DMG. Quotes:<br/><br/>"One of the cornerstones of improvisational theater technique is called \u201cYes, and . . .\u201d It\u2019s based on the idea that an actor takes whatever the other actor gives and builds on that. That\u2019s your job as well."<br/><br/>"Being the DM doesn\u2019t mean you have to know all the rules. If a player tries something you don\u2019t know how to adjudicate, ask the opinion of the players as a group. It might take a few minutes, but it\u2019s usually possible to hash out an answer that seems fair."<br/><br/>"You shouldn\u2019t be afraid to delegate some of the job of running the game to your players. If you don\u2019t want to break your narrative stride by looking up a rule, designate another player to be the rulebook reference expert. Players can make the DM\u2019s life easier in a lot of little ways, from never making you pay for pizza to helping to flesh out the background of the campaign world. You have enough to do, delegate what you can. When a group of players shares the responsibilities of running the game, everyone has more fun. Best of all, the players feel as though it\u2019s their game, not just yours."<br/><br/>"A single DM is great because . . ."<br/>"The weaknesses of a single DM are . . ."<br/><br/>"Multiple DMs are great because . . ."<br/>"The weaknesses of multiple DMs are . . ."<br/><br/>"A campaign game is great because . . ."<br/>"The weakness of a campaign game is . . ."<br/><br/>"An episodic game is great because . . ."<br/>"The weakness of an episodic game is . . ."<br/><br/>"An On going game is great because . . ."<br/>"The weakness of an ongoing game is . . ."<br/><br/>"A One-shot game is great because . . ."<br/>"The weaknesses of a one-shot game are . . ."<br/><br/>"Come to a consensus about food for your session. Should players eat before arriving, or do you eat together? Does one player want to play host? Do you all chip in for pizza or take-out? Who brings snacks and drinks?"<br/><br/>"Most players enjoy many aspects of the game at different times. For convenience, we define the primary player motivations as types of players: actors, explorers, instigators, power gamers, slayers, storytellers, thinkers, and watchers."<br/><br/>X player is...<br/>Engage X player by . . .<br/>Be sure X player doesn\u2019t . . .<br/><br/>"One-Hour Preparation"<br/>"Two-Hour Preparation"<br/>"Three-Hour Preparation"<br/>"Four-Hour Preparation"<br/>"No Time to Prepare!"<br/><br/>"Problem Players"<br/>"Setting Expectations"<br/>"Out-of-Control Players"<br/>"Prima Donna Players"<br/>"Rules Lawyers"<br/>"Balancing Player Tastes"<br/><br/>"Event-Based Adventures<br/>If a good outdoor adventure map is a sort of abstraction of a dungeon map, then the \u201cmap\u201d for a purely event-based adventure is even more so. But the idea of a dungeon map as flowchart is a great metaphor for how to structure an adventure around events and decisions instead of around physical space. An event-based adventure focuses on the things the characters do rather than the places they go."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146401/#Comment_146401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T09:58:55+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  9:58AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2008 9:59AM by misuba.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do they actually say about rules lawyers and prima donnas?

Many people did it anyway and thus elevated their game to a living, breathing and exciting roleplaying experience. With its shift in design ethos 4th Edition seems to channel its players' creativity in a different manner than earlier editions. It'll be interesting to see what adventures and campaigns in D&amp;D4 "feel" like (for lack of a better word), once people have grown comfortable with the game and start to move beyond what the books cover.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146511/#Comment_146511" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T15:59:24+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  3:59PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AfT: I was just quoting the various kinds of theatricals performed on the fora I know, I don't agree with any of them, pretty much. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146516/#Comment_146516" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T16:44:00+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  4:44PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2008 4:46PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I know, and I wasn't trying to suggest that you were approving of any of the usual hysterical internet caterwauling; it's more that I was, personally, actually beginning to <i>worry</i> about whether the battlemaps and miniatures would be ditchable or not, and was pleased to see that they probably are.

The beginning of the PHB states that D&amp;D miniatures and a battle grid or dungeon tiles are optional. But many people who have skimmed the PHB have assumed that meant that tracking position on a grid was optional. This is incorrect using the rules as written. All they mean is that you can use graph paper to track position or some other method. But fixed positioning indicated in a manner that can easily be tracked by all participants is part of the game. From the combat section: <br/><br/>"The combat rules assume that you use D&amp;D Dungeon Tiles, a poster map, a gridded white board, or an erasable, gridded mat to show the area where a battle takes place."<br/><br/>And step 2 of combat is:<br/><br/>"Establish positions. The DM decides where the combatants are positioned on the battle grid. For example, if the PCs have just opened a door into a room, the DM might draw or arrange a depiction of the door and the room on the battle grid and then ask the players to arrange their miniatures near the door. Then the DM places miniatures that represent the monsters in the room."<br/><br/>The DMG states several times that the Battle Grid is a required part of the game. <br/><br/>I've also heard that in previous versions of the 4E DMG, they actually had an option to run combat without a Battle Grid but they took that out of the final version. Several playtest groups (many which hate using maps) even ran 4E without a Battle Grid and found it too slow and that it unbalanced the classes and powers. <br/><br/>That being said, it's not impossible. But 4E is a tight game that has been playtested the hell out of. I wouldn't want to play it without the grid. If I don't like miniature combat, I can't fathom why I would want to play 4E. There are so many amazing games that run similar settings without grids that are far more story based (Burning Wheel). <br/><br/>Back to the thread, the DMG is fantastic. I bought 4E just for the DMG. <br/><br/>In terms of playing, it's very exhilarating at first with all the amazing power options. But as you level up, you quickly realize so many of the powers are all essentially the same and the winning combos become apparent quickly where what was first perceived as an abundance of choice quickly feels strained and narrow. But the game has a lot going for it. I love how combat works, I love the power categories, and I love how easy and rewarding it is to level up. Plus the game is far easier for the DM to run. Which is always a good thing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gorsh" title="Gorsh"><img alt="Gorsh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gorsh">Gorsh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146535/#Comment_146535" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T18:36:11+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  6:36PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just stop by to say: "Yes, And"... someone go tell Graham W, i want to see his reaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146536/#Comment_146536" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T18:43:20+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  6:43PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Where's the difference between these situations?</blockquote>\nThat's it's socially acceptable (even expected) in gaming circles to claim minis "get in the way of roleplaying" or "lack imagination", and thus it's de rigeur to talk about not using them?<br/><br/>I don't get it.

It's taken as evidence of shoddy game design that he felt he needed/wished to do that.<br><br>Over here (and elsewhere on the internet), I keep hearing about how folks are planning to dump the minis rules/map usage from D&amp;D4.0, and it seems like it gets a pass. To me, that looks like exactly the thing Corley was talking about doing with oldVamp.<br><br>Where's the difference between these situations?</br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nThe difference is that JD Corley is awesome, and makes me want to play Vampire now that I know what I'm doing, and using the game as more than a tool for chasing hot goth ass.<br><br>More seriously, though, the idea that was coming up (and it's only Valamir as far as I can tell who is doing task-taking, mind, not "folks"; interestingly enough I simultaneously agree and believe in both of their viewpoints; I contain multitudes) was that Vampire says the game is about X, Y, and Z, and helps you also do things on the tracks of U, V and W as well. But from a point of view, it doesn't focus on X Y or Z clearly, and seems to hae a kind of schizophrenia about addressing those topics with the rules. To which the stately retort-argument is, "The setting is in fact as important as the rules (perhaps moreso), the setting IS the game, as much as the numeric dice rules stuff and humanity tracks are."<br><br>Here, with 4e, the differences are lining up like apples and oranges. From what I've seen of the books, there is no "setting material" in the core books. Vampire has pages and pages of fiction to draw you in. The 1st edition even has an awesome comic throughout the book which tells a beautiful little vampire story. It has tons of setting material to explain the game and how its played, once you get past the dross of the rules.<br><br>In 4e, there's no setting material, no set settings and the like. We just have a world of crunchy rules with little or no flavor text. The only thing to measure the "feel" and "direction" of the game in the way we'd look to the setting and fiction sections of Vampire or Tribe 8 or Blue Planet, is a lot of color art, a few god names, and just a feel that the rules exude in the way the characters are made to be heroic and not peons via the powerz and the like.  <br><br>If 4e had more setting material in the books, then it might be comparable on that front.<br/><br/>The other front is the rules: Vampire provides a ton of rules that you may or may not ever use, but expect you to use the core mechanic in some form or other. Provides humanity, but doesn't expect you to force your adventures to use that mechanic Uber Alles (the game text from 1e was all about a Forever Knight-style vampire cop who uses vampire powers to catch bad guys)., nor does it expect you to slavishly follow the combat rules or whatever. Truth is, it's probably because you may see vampire games at conventions and the like, but you won't see "vampire tournaments" where knowing and enforcing the rules are super-important. On the other hand, 4e is wired so tight with the board that it's like (as described above) playing Settlers of Catan without a board. Or Monopoly. <br/><br/>Everntually, someone might be able to hack together an alternative. Perhaps using a variant of "zones" or something, something where you can draw a few circles on a sheet of paper, and not worry about squares and Shifts. But going for 4e without graph paper or a board seems kinda naieve to me. At that point, I'd think you'd be just as good off playing another game that focuses more on the non-combat stuff that you want.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I'm gradually going over to JDCorley's "The developer got hit by a truck" philosophy, I think.</blockquote>\nHeh, I wasn't gradually going there.

Since it's our decision what games we play or don't play (which will probably include dozens of the hundreds of other awesome RPGs out there, since we're always trying out different systems), if we see enough coolness there, then we're just going to go ahead and strip out the battlemat stuff and probably still have an awesome time.  <br/><br/><br/>Personally, I could see enjoying the unaltered system if the GM really got off on drawing accurate maps (and could whip 'em out quickly), and especially if everyone at the table was equally psyched about moving the counters around; but I already know that this isn't the case with all of my friends, and that's fine, too.  We've had plenty of fun with looser, less-well-defined maps, so for our purposes I expect that it won't really matter whether the book calls for a battlegrid and markers; if we can ditch them and still have fun, they'll get ditched.  We'll just do what we always do: sketch out something not-to-scale, and negotiate and re-negotiate the fine details as they become necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146583/#Comment_146583" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T23:28:26+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 11:28PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite><br/>I see the opposite.

Which aspect(s) of the roleplaying game do you enjoy using your creativity in? Maybe it's expanding and developing a character's personality. Maybe it's extrapolating and affecting situations tactically. Maybe it's building and upholding the tone and style of the adventure, you're playing. There are some things that 4E leaves wide open, and if it's one of the aspects you are comfortable creating in, making the game your own should be fairly easy. There are some other things; namely extrapolating from a given situation to gain a tactical advantage ("If we know that there is ABC, that must mean according to the setting there must also be DEF; which means we can do GHI to get what we're after.") that D&amp;D4 doesn't explicitly encourage to do and doesn't leave as wide open as 3rd Edition did.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean, that it cannot be done in 4E. But if you're not used to doing it like this, don't know what you're looking for or find even the slightest limitation by the rules intrusive, 4E will be a hard game to like for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_146585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146585/#Comment_146585" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T23:43:01+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 11:43PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>E.

Some DMs like to add a sixth hat to that stack: rules designer. House rules are variants on the basic rules designed specifically for a particular DM\u2019s campaign. They add fun to your D&amp;D game by making it unique, reflecting specific traits of your world.<br/><br/>A house rule also serves as a handy patch for a game feature that your group dislikes. The D&amp;D rules cannot possibly account for the variety of campaigns and play styles of every group. If you disagree with how the rules handle something, changing them is within your rights.<br/><br/>This advice can\u2019t turn you into an expert game designer - we\u2019d need more than a page for that. Instead, this is a basic introduction to the concepts behind rules design.

It makes sense to me on a really practical level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146623/#Comment_146623" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T06:58:08+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  6:58AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Andy, <br/><br/>Can we start a new thread to talk more about the hot goth ass? <br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[4e] DMG - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6594/4e-dmg/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[4e] DMG - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6594/4e-dmg/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: merb101Hey Andy, Can we start a new thread to talk more about the hot goth ass?

handy.  Then, no battlemat, and you can use whatever you want for markers, as long as they're of a consistent size (poker chips spring to mind).</blockquote>\nFunny thing is that is the way things worked back in the 3.0 days...

Some DMs like to add a sixth hat to that stack: rules designer. House rules are variants on the basic rules designed specifically for a particular DM\u2019s campaign. They add fun to your D&amp;D game by making it unique, reflecting specific traits of your world.<br/><br/>A house rule also serves as a handy patch for a game feature that your group dislikes. The D&amp;D rules cannot possibly account for the variety of campaigns and play styles of every group. If you disagree with how the rules handle something, changing them is within your rights.</blockquote>\nThat advice will fuel a few delusions - and is probably the result of delusion itself, rather than just ill chosen words.<br/><br/>I have the right to do with these people as I wish, DMG?<br/><br/>I can anticipate responces I might get here "Oh, they don't really mean that, you just use it for some small changes like X,Y,Z". No, picking and choosing a 'reasonable' way of interpreting that is no better. Even if you whittle it down to some very small 'right' to change some really tiny modifier, the right was never given in the first place to be whittled down.<br/><br/>It's like a book about girls thats <b>texts</b> will tell you when you have the 'right' to kiss a girl. Text doesn't grant that right, the girl does. Or doesn't, as the case may be. Even if you whittle down that 'right' that book gives, it's still working from a deluded idea that the book gives you some sort of right. And consent, whether it be in kissing or roleplay, works the same way.<br/><br/>Eh, not that I haven't seen this in just about every roleplay game (yes, plenty of it in indie games too).

Also, I think one of the primary purposes of these guidelines, and others like them in trad games, isto reduce the likelihood of coercive, authoritarian behavior at the table.  Growing up in the hobby, finding someone at the table who tried to shout down others and dictate playstyle for everyone by appealing to the rules was a very common problem, and having a passage in the rules that said, it's your game, and you can do what you want with it, had real value in putting a stop to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146848/#Comment_146848" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T07:36:33+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  7:36AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Georgios</cite>That has nothing to do with delusion, though.

Pointing out that the book actually says that the rules are subject to change or interpretation was often very freeing for them.

Some of the best GMing / play advice from any book I've read ever.  There were bits and pieces here and there that scraped me the wrong way, bits that sounded more like "this is the way you should run your game" and less like "here's a bunch of suggestions on how you might want to run your game."  However, I find it a bit strange that the DMG chose to go that route when what I've seen of the PHB is clearly taking a much more focused approach to the kind of play it's trying to create.  The DMG implies that there are lots of different kinds of play that could be potentially supported by D&amp;D4, but the PHB seems to strongly point towards a more specific style of play than other editions.  And the DMG is less good at explaining exactly what kind of play this new, more focused D&amp;D4 is best at and how to get the most out of it.  So, yeah, it's surprisingly awesome as a general text on GMing and running a game.  But as the corebook explaining how to run this specific game?  I'm less sure. I'd want more advice like Andy/Clinton's comments about the kinds of settings that would work with this, where some others might not, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146973/#Comment_146973" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T21:39:23+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  9:39PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2008 9:43PM by Kuma.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the advice in the DMG is premature, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've had a chance to read a lot of it over, and it seems like they're talking in the DMG like there are already a hundred different modes of play described in the canon: The idea that there's already a <i>Blue Rose</i> swords-and-ponies version of 4e out there.  As I'm reading the PHB, I see almost nothing in it that suggests support for a mode of play other than a concrete/tactical approach. Even the warlock, easily the character class with the most out-of-combat possibilites with rituals, has nothing listed that I would describe as more than a daily power.  Nothing ... campaign-wide, I suppose would be a term I could pull out of my hat.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that such things won't or can't be added on later - I can see a whole range of possibilities for things like courtly intrigue with this new power system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey just don't exist *yet*.

RPGs are, in general, very complex games with a lot of rules and a lot of pages dedicated to them. D&amp;D is certainly a very complex game. While I love playing boardgames and in the majority of them the rules fit in just a few pages, D&amp;D starter rules span over 3 big books. Furthermore, the weight of knowing them is often on the DM's shoulders almost alone. This can be daunting and being told that it is ok if the rules vary from group to group can be comforting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147033/#Comment_147033" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-31T15:43:03+00:00" title="May 31, 2008  3:43PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have found the PHB to be a reference during play and the DMG to be something the DM uses during prep.

But the fact remains that there's no mechanical support for those other modes of play.  Yes, they exist.  No, they're not supported in the PHB, and for that matter not supported to a large extent in the DMG.  Non-combat encounters are broken down into: skill challenges, puzzles and traps.
