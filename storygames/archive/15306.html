One of the people we had at the festival, was an old Dakota chieftain. He made a very strong impression on me. He told the story of his people, but not the story of oppression and hurt. He was committed to preserving their heritage, to give as much as he could of it to the younger generations. So he told stories of leadership, work and pride, philosophy and culture, and great myths. He told us the Dakota and Lakota indians were people of the great plains.<br/><br/>- <i>Like a Sioux</i>, asked I. <br/>- The indian looked at me, all serious, and said: <i>No, not like a "sioux". The word sioux is from my language, he said, and it means "dog". That is the name the white people put on us. They took our word for dogs, and named us by it. We do not call ourselves dogs.</i> <br/>He said it with no malice, and I wondered how a man could say such a thing about his own life and identity, and be so calm.<br/><br/>That chieftain is still a hero to me. His calm answer to the ignorant question of mine, is one of the greatest lessons I've ever had.<br/><br/>When I googled the Dakota indians tonight, i found a site for children, answering questions about the "Dakota-Lakota Sioux Language". I was perplexed; how come this sioux-word is part of this site? I suppose it's a clouded issue for both indians and whites alike, today.<br/><br/><b>Anyway: <br/>- my challenge is for you, the Americans amongst us here, to make role-playing games about indians. <br/>You may, of course, choose to make a game on any indians, in any time, with whatever theme you deem to be the most interesting.<br/>Pluck up your courage, and go forth calmly.<br/>Show leadership.</b><br/>______________________________________________________<br/><br/>BTW: <br/>I wrote a suit of poems dedicated to this Dakota chieftain some years later, telling the story of how his eagle-form graced the streets of Oslo, and learned our spirits to fly. They were part of a book I published in 1996, called <i>Mouthfullmoon</i>. The particular suit of poems dedicated to the Dakota chieftain was called <i>The History of Flying Technique</i>.<br/><br/>This is one of the poems (my translation):<br/><br/><i>We are frail beings<br/>fleeing the gravitation.<br/><br/>Dancing eagles<br/>on snowy boardwalks,<br/>covering the heavens<br/>with our wings.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_347912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347912/#Comment_347912" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T23:59:31+00:00" title="November  4, 2011 11:59PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had some whispers here, but fear that people are too emotional to discuss this theme openly now, at least with me.

I'm happy therefore to be corrected, but my understanding is that in the US the term Indian is seen as offensive when used in this way. I think the preferred term is Native American. Happy to be corrected though as I say.<br/><br/>More pressingly, your posts on this subject have smacked to me of exoticisation, which is a form of racist depiction. Making people an other, perhaps in some ways a better other (wiser or whatever) but an other. The approach seems each time to be about us engaging with them, which presupposes that they are not us.<br/><br/>Finally, and most importantly, you ask Americans to write a game about Indians. That language strongly implies to me a dichotomy. Two separate groups. Americans and Indians. The thing is though that Native Americans are Americans. To create the artificial separation your language implies is to put them again in that position of the other, which historically didn't go so well.<br/><br/>You invite Americans to make roleplaying games about Indians as if one cannot be both. Your language, to be blunt, seems racist to me.<br/><br/>All that and frankly it just seems in plain bad taste. Essentially you're asking the victors of a historical struggle to make up games about the losers of that struggle. I find that distasteful. If you want to know more about Native Americans there are some excellent books on the subject, some by academics and some collating folklore and oral accounts. The key is that those texts don't objectify, which I think you are.<br/><br/>Apologies if I've harshed the vibe. I don't mean to. I just find these posts troubling and felt it worth saying why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347932/#Comment_347932" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T05:42:45+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  5:42AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What term people use depends on who is talking.

I am a white American, but I have never oppressed anyone. I was not involved in the historical struggle between natives and invaders, but I expect that if I had been, I'd have probably died defending the former, because clearly, what was done to the native Americans by Europeans was wrong. However, I don't think it is racist to make a game about native Americans, even if Tomas calls them Indians.<br/><br/><br/>For another example, I was ashamed the way the media made a circus for months after president Obama was elected, about how exciting it was to have our first black president. I was ashamed for my country, frankly, that it took as long as it did before there was even an electable candidate who was non-white. And then to celebrate his black-ness for months after the election seemed like a huge self-pat-on-the-back to me, as if to say, "See, we're really NOT racist!" I just shook my head. I thought to myself, "Here is a guy who has excellent values, a strong presence, and looks to genuinely be interested in doing some good for his country, and all anyone seems to care about is that he's a black man..."<br/><br/>More to the point, I really feel like you, and almost everyone who has been arguing against Tomas, are focusing on the wrong thing. You seem to also be arguing against a position he doesn't take. Tomas never said that "Indians" were somehow different from others in some way that, say, Finnish people and Irish people are not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347936/#Comment_347936" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T07:07:12+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  7:07AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I consider myself a "white american", but my mother is a quarter Cherokee (making me 1/8th native american). I have to agree with Joseph on this one. I've been biting my e-tongue not to jump into these conversations about how "racist" Tomas is. There is nothing racist about wanting to incorporate indians or native americans into games. They have an amazing and admirable culture and history, and there's no reason we shouldn't consider them just as much a target for story telling as European, African, or Asian cultures. I, for one, often play native american characters in games like Shadowrun and Deadlands. Why? Because they're fucking cool. Doesn't mean I'm racist or that Shadowrun is racist, but rest assured, someone out there will take it upon themselves to be offended just to be offended. There's someone out there to get offended about just about anything. And then there are people that are actively seeking to be offended, or actively seek to point out how offensive someone else is being. Most people <b>thrive on conflict </b>(especially on internet forums) and accusing people of racism is a perfect tactic for them because they'll always look and feel like they're the one on the moral high ground.<br/><br/>There is nothing inherently racist about the term Indian either. People call the indigenous americans "Indians" because Colombus thought he discovered India when he landed in North America and the name stuck. It's not a slur (unless you have something against East Indians), it's just inaccurate. Since then, seeing as how "indian" is a misnomer and most people don't like to be labeled something they're not, they've come up with more politcally correct terms like Native American, but even that name is not accepted by every tribe or person. There is no 100% correct catch-all term so most of us use whatever we're familiar with or whatever we understand will offend the least amount of people. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>More to the point, I really feel like you, and almost everyone who has been arguing against Tomas, are focusing on the wrong thing.

It's like everyone <i>wants</i> Tomas to be racist so they can tell him how horrible his ideas are. I mean, seriously, give the guy a break. Stop trying to insist that he has a point of view that he keeps telling everyone he does not have. He may not be the most informed person when it comes to politically correct terminologies, but that doesn't mean he's a biggot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347940/#Comment_347940" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T07:17:52+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  7:17AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2011 7:18AM by Dave Hallett.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People, although this discussion seems pretty sane and reasonable (hooray!), I'm not sure this is the place for it.<br/><br/>I don't see any point in Max publicly addressing Tomas in this thread when Tomas has explicitly stated that he's not going to respond (which I think is a sensible choice given recent events).

Why are we calling for conversations to be shut down?  Storygames has run for years without any need to silence subjects or people.  I don't think it is a good idea to start doing it now.<br/><br/>I agree very much with the general sentiment of UserClone and SentientGames.  At the same time, I had a similar reaction as D-503 to the original post.  <br/><br/>On the one hand, Native Americans can make for all kinds of cool characters in a wide range of settings (personally, I always seem to lean towards a modern, crime setting for one where it would be cool to play a Native American PC; Unknown Armies comes to mind).  <br/><br/>On the other hand, this excessive romanticisation is kind of weird and seems a bit fetishistic.  Why would I want a game specifically about Native Americans any more than one about Dukabors or Jewish immigrants coming to Montreal at the turn of the century?  [Actually, now that I think about this, how would such a game be any different than Grey Ranks?  Why  does that game get a pass from this community, but not a similar game about Native Americans?]<br/><br/>I haven't read the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1491:_New_Revelations_of_the_Americas_Before_Columbus" rel="nofollow">1491</a> yet, but I suspect that might be the coolest way to have a game about the indigenous people of North America.  Just set it in their world with a sick setting book and get involved in all the political and social conflicts, exploration and adventure that they may have had back then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347970/#Comment_347970" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T12:40:32+00:00" title="November  5, 2011 12:40PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Voicing my disgust is participating.

There are so few games that do justice to indigenous peoples, be they Native Americans or whomever. Off the top of my head, aside from an interesting take on religion, deities and fantasy in the AD&amp;D 2E "Legends and Lore" chapter on Native American culture and religion, or the guising' it up in fantasy cloth in Dark Sun (many of the city-states are actually fairly honest culturally-rich recreations of real-world cultures done up in fantasy: I dunno why such talented authors got together and decided that this setting would be the one where non-Western societies would be portrayed so culturally rich) and other such campaign worlds, there's the Tibet RPG (which is more about bullet hit location and armour than about culture clash and history, admittedly) and more recently "How We Came to Live Here" ( <a href="http://galileogames.com/how-we-came-to-live-here/" rel="nofollow">http://galileogames.com/how-we-came-to-live-here/</a> ).<br/><br/>By all means, the challenge (perhaps not as presented, but it's spirit): Design a game about Native Americans, learning about them in the process, is a solid one. This isn't really a game designer-focused forum, but even in play in existing systems the challenge could still stand (a 1700s-era scenario for the three Leni Lenape tribes using "Lady Blackbird", etc).<br/><br/>But...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>How about if you don't like the subject or find it offensive, you don't participate.  Why are we calling for conversations to be shut down?  Storygames has run for years without any need to silence subjects or people.  I don't think it is a good idea to start doing it now.</blockquote>\n...I agree with Judd. He didn't really call for moderation, or a thread-lock. Truth is, this topic would not have been problematic if it were posted 4 months back or 4 months in the future, even by Tomas. Just on the heels of all the other business, this comes across more as a half-earnest challenge, and half of a "I want to publicly vindicate what people might be feeling about me here (with personal stories and poetry), because I lack a facebook/livejournal account where I can do so elsewhere." I'll be nice and pretend that it's more for the former reason than the latter. But still, in the middle of a kind of kerfluffle? Not very decent, but whatever.<br/><br/>So I won't nuke this thread. Again, the challenge underlying all the... other stuff... is a sound one. I'd ask that if you believe in the challenge and want to take it up, that you do so elsewhere and post your results later, feel free to create your own threads detailing your efforts: If you have a game, we'll read and playtest your game, give you feedback on both the game and the spirit in which you wrote it, the care you took in addressing the issues present in the game, and so on.<br/><br/>And even though the thread won't be closed (at least for now, we'll see if things change), if you believe in the intent of the thread, then focus on that, and simply do it elsewhere. No further discussion here is really needed or called for. It is, in fact, too soon.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348080/#Comment_348080" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T05:52:23+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  5:52AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um.  There is a game, I helped illustrate it.  Its called Totems of the Dead for Savage Worlds.  Now, granted, it is very sword and sorcery, but the Americas it depicts is pretty solidly researched as far as I can tell.  I'm no expert.  But my best friend in high school is now an archaeologist at Cornell.  He studies Iroquois-colonial time period at a few digs.  The illustration I had to do concerning the Iroquios, I went to him for research.<br/><br/>If *I* was a game designer, and I wanted to really seriously tackle an Americas RPG, I think the emphasis would be on trade between tribes.  My friend found a bead in a site near Geneva, NY (top of Lake Seneca).  This site was a dual colonial-iroquis site, both were living there, it was a trading town. It also has the distinction of being the first found in that time period with no defensive palisade.  Both tidbits I find really interesting!   Back to the bead.  The bead is made of stone and it could ONLY have come from Baja California.  That bead travelled!!!  That is kinda cool and suggests a very robust trading network across the whole north continent.  I've read some other theories in the last few years that seem to support a very sophisticated trade network in both continents.<br/><br/>My last bit comes from an NPR article that I heard about 10 years ago.  There was this tree researcher/expert at Michigan University.  He studies trees primarily in the "ohio valley".  When white colonials came to the Ohio valley, they said a squirrel could leave Maine and travel all the way to Indiana by tree limb and never touch the ground.  That is how dense and primeval the forest was in the Ohio valley.  I was told as a lad that my neck of the woods use to be nothing but untouched, natural, old growth trees.  That the whole Ohio Valley was made of this amazing old growth forest.<br/><br/>Not so fast.  Our tree expert from Mich U understands that tree growth in fallow fields follows a certain, specific pattern.  The ohio valley?  Fits exactly that pattern.  His theory;  The entire Ohio Valley was cleared and was farms and agriculture from Ohio to Connecticut. Prior to white explorer's coming.  When they did come, they didn't see old growth trees, they saw trees that were 200 years old.... which syncs up perfectly with the ravaging diseases that raced across the continent and depopulated the population... allowing those fields to go untended...allowing the trees to grow back in the same way they grow now when a field goes untended.  <br/><br/>Again, pointing to a much more vast quiltwork of tribes and civilizations than the first western explorers could have dreamed of.  By the time they got there, it was all buried under trees.  <br/><br/>So.  My take on a cool native american campaign would be to center on a hardy band of traders, travelling from tribe to tribe, exchanging stories and goods.  But I have to be very honest with myself.  That would be such a cool campaign in my head, but oh by all the gods of gaming, that would be a aircraft carrier amount of work and prep.  And there aren't really a lot of sources.  Some regions have some pretty good research into them (Pacific NW, Mesa Verde area, history after whites make contact), but others, are only just now starting to get any scrutiny at all.  I seriously doubt my ability as a scholar or a gamemaster to pull off such an undertaking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348082/#Comment_348082" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T06:31:30+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  6:31AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Storn:<br/>As a fellow Western NYSer by birth, I'd say pretty much anything having to do with the Longhouse League is worth exploring gamewise. <br/><br/>Certainly the diplomacy surrounding Iroquois entry into the AWI ( and the internal divisions caused by it) is well worth exploring, especially when you mix in the different approach to the position of societal power of men and women within Iroquois culture, and the different pressures on different nations within the League, what it means to politick within a society based around consensual democracy, as well as just plain old personality differences among the players involved.<br/><br/>As for what colonists discovered in different areas, IIRC, the book <i>The Invasion of America: Indians, Colonialism, and the Cant of Conquest </i> goes into a it of that, although focussing more on the eastern seaboard areas rather than the Ohio Valley. The book is a bit dated now and definitely a product of the early 1970s. it would probably make a nice companion/comparison piece to that work on the Ohio Valley you were talking about, however.<br/><br/>Tomas, if you're still reading this thread, that ight be one worth checking out, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348084/#Comment_348084" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T06:54:55+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  6:54AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, I'm sure you mean well, but you may want to reread Andy's last post.
