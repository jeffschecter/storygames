You may have to buy them from time to time and you'll probably run out of spells before running out of material components. Doesn't matter if you just learned the spell five minutes ago, if the components are cheap they will probably be around somewhere, and you might not even need to roll Spot to find them.<br/><br/>Because going on with the story is of course more fun than watching the wizard waste time on a really stupid sub-quest. Well, having the cleric find diamond dust to resurrect a party member may count as fun, but who has sent a party to look for bat guano, while the kingdom confronts a dragon invasion? I know it sucks enough as a magic user to run out of spells, so running out of components must suck twice as bad.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering what's the fun here? has anybody used scarcity of material components as part of the game? Maybe once at low levels? How did it went, it was fun, it was a disaster, too distracting, it was a nice change of pace? Would you try it? Would you do it again?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427972/#Comment_427972" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-04T20:28:16+00:00" title="February  4, 2014  8:28PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The trick is to have the material components come in not at casting time, but rather at memorization. In general it's a nice idea to make spell memorization subject to a bit of strategic tension: can you, or can you not, do it in camping conditions, or do you need to get back to base for it? Consider:<br/>- Lugging the spell book around is difficult, and it's pretty expensive a tome even if you don't artificially inflate prices because of magic.<br/>- If memorization requires magical ritual, as it does with me, that could be easier to accomplish in a controlled environment. Your controlled environment might even have prepared tools and aids that further improve the efficacy of the memorization process.<br/>- Memorization takes time, and that time doesn't need to be a tactical amount; it can be e.g. a hour per spell level, in which case it begins to become strategically interesting whether you'll want to stick around in the woods outside the dungeon while the wizard spends the entire day memorizing spells.<br/>- If spell memorization takes material components, and those cost money and cause encumbrance, then that's one more logistical challenge involved in bringing the magic on the road.<br/><br/>In my conception material components are a nice fictional detail and logistical complication, just like e.g. encumbrance or the shortening length of the day as winter solstice approaches. Our D&amp;D gaming is up to its ears in this shit, so material components don't look that much out of the place. We don't do long-term spreadsheet stuff on the logistics, though, so for the most part these are topics that are discussed, principles, rulings and strategic practices are drafted, and then they're set aside until some new ideas come up. So in practice things like material components to magic come up only occasionally, when the magic-user is doing something particularly new or interesting or different from the usual routine.<br/><br/>The next time I'm running a campaign, chances are that I'll set a new expense: memorizing spells costs 1 rupee per spell level in consumable material components. Further details depend on the magician's specific cultural practice, and I imagine that the magician could scrounge the components at about 1 rupee's worth per hour, should he need to rely on picking herbs or whatever. In practice I think I'll track this material expenditure in the abstract, just have the player write down how much money they want to put into the assorted material components. This rule idea might make more sense when I mention that our games tend to be very low-level (like, I've had two characters survive to 2nd level over a year of weekly play at this point), and it is not always obvious that you have enough money for even such modest expenses.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427973/#Comment_427973" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-04T21:16:48+00:00" title="February  4, 2014  9:16PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2014 9:27PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>strategic practices are drafted, and then they're set aside until some new ideas come up.

I think the value of issues like Spell Components (when present*) is color and strategy.  Usually one time through exhausts these.  We get the color, we solve the problem, and no need to ever bother with it again.<br/><br/>Depending on the particular solution employed, the GM may resurrect Spell Components as an issue if some situation arises which effectively creates a brand new problem.<br/><br/>I find this logic holds true for countless things in challenge-based fantasy adventure gaming: marching order, travel schedule, swamp wear, river crossings, night watch shifts, camping alarms, dungeon trap-testing, pre-fight shield and weapon prep, torch prep, cooking and transporting meat, sending letters, and on and on.  After a dozen sessions you can just assume such things are taken care of, but getting to that point is part of the fun of gritty low-level play.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you don't enjoy solving such mundane problems, and want to devote every minute of play to dramatic stuff, then I'd advise you to just say, "We've all been adventuring for a while.  When logistics come up, if the characters have probably dealt with this issue before, assume they're already set up to achieve what they want, and move on."<br/><br/>Whichever end of the spectrum you pick, just make sure the GM and the players are on the same page about where the challenge is going to come from.  It sucks when the GM introduces "midnight campsite ambush" as a challenge and the players want to assume they've already set something up to make ambush impossible.<br/><br/>* I must admit, I've never played through any fun color and problem-solving around Spell Components specifically.  My groups initially treated it as mere bookkeeping.  Of course we then dropped that, as we got nothing out of it.  We had lots of fun with cooking and torches, though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427978/#Comment_427978" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-04T23:14:54+00:00" title="February  4, 2014 11:14PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played and run a few games where resource scarcity was a real issue.  In my Dark Sun game, spell components were hard to find and illegal to buy, which mattered for the caster character and would have mattered more if he wasn't even more concerned about food and water.<br/><br/>In a lost in time and space game, a caster's lack of access to spell components (and later, spellbook) was a major plot point--as was my cowboy character's lack of access to bullets and gunpowder.<br/><br/>Another great use of spell components is to suggest action on the part of PCs.  You find several chunks of unpolished onyx.  You could sell them to a merchant for a handful of silver, or you could... raise the dead!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427979/#Comment_427979" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-04T23:15:13+00:00" title="February  4, 2014 11:15PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2014 11:19PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In high school, we handled material components the same way we did pretty much everything else: the most excruciating, finicky, micromanaging way we could. Wizards and clerics kept detailed lists of what components they had on hand, how much, where they kept them, etc...and spent time after any caster fight scavenging the components off of their foes. It was just...man, we had a lot of time on our hands back then, that's all I'm saying. And we were probably kind of dumb.<br/><br/>When 3e came out and my current group started playing, we took the rulebook's advice and only tracked material components that actually cost real money. If a spell needs bat guano or a feather or salt and you haven't been kidnapped or arrested or otherwise robbed of your gear? Congratulations, you have those components! You can say your pockets are constantly stuffed full of bat guano if that's how you like it. But if the spell's component is a pearl worth 100gp or 50gp of powdered silver or 1000gp of diamond dust, go buy it and write it down in your inventory, and mark it off when you use it.<br/><br/><br/>The "not kidnapped or arrested or otherwise robbed of your gear" part was what added some slight theoretical value to Eschew Materials as a feat -- taking away components from a spellcaster was one of the first things you did if you needed to hold one for any length of time, because it limited them to spells that didn't need any. It's nice to know that whatever happens, the guy won't be able to chuck a fireball at you. Not really a game-changer, but y'know, after my high school gaming experience, I was all for any answer that said, "let's not make a big deal out of this." As David_Berg aptly puts it above, usually one time through exhausts all the color and strategic options inherent in tracking something like mundane spell components. No reason to go through it again.<br/><br/>(Eschew Materials still wasn't as generally useful as Silent or Still Spell, but it was colorful, and sometimes that counts for more. I think we did have a sorcerer who took it for just that reason -- he wanted to taunt wizards about how their fingers always smelled like bat poop.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427985/#Comment_427985" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T05:50:03+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  5:50AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm finding "deduct the GP cost of any expensive material components from the party's loot" to be a perfectly effective way of managing components.

But I think it could be done with slight adjustments (some fine examples of this up there in Eero's post).<br/><br/>I'm thinking of something like "the spice" in <i>Dune</i>. It has both a strategic and a thematic importance in the setting, and is highly valuable. <br/><br/>If material components are mundane things like a feather and a pinch of dust, I'd probably say that we might as well just simplify matters to something like this:<br/><br/>* Under normal circumstances, assume that a wizard has access to all the necessary components.<br/>* If the wizard has been captured/had her components bag stolen/sabotaged, then this becomes an issue: you need to get that bag of components back!<br/>* Charge the players a certain amount to restock the component supply, whether on a regular basis (once a week) or per expensive spell (as Deliverator suggests, above). This adds an economic aspect to spell use.<br/><br/>However, if certain types of magic require different types of components, and these have some kind of special relevance to the setting or the people in it, then things become interesting.<br/><br/>Let's say that divination spells require the consumption of a mind-altering and addictive drug, which also happens to be illegal. Maybe buying it or even carrying it is against the law. Or its smell attracts some kind of monster/spirit/otherwordly attention. Now we're facing interesting choices:<br/><br/>Are you willing to face addiction in order to use this kind of magic?<br/><br/>Is it worth it to you to carry this component into the city with you, even though you could be arrested if it's discovered on your person?<br/><br/>Will you risk carrying the component with you into the lower level of the dungeon, even though its smell could attract a certain type of monster?<br/><br/>If you don't, you'll be safe... but you won't have access to your divination magic. Choose carefully!<br/><br/>Or maybe your necromantic magic requires a human or humanoid's eyeball to cast. (And those are probably not very easy to preserve or carry around.) Now we can have difficult situations like: the Orcs are attacking the village, and there's no way to hold them off. Unless, that is, the wizard can raise an army of the dead to scare them away. Okay, who's willing to give up an eye to save the village? Will the wizard gouge out his own eyeball, sacrificing himself? Or will another hero? Maybe the village Elder's young daughter, selfless and pure, is volunteering to lose hers in order to save everyone she cares about. Or will the PCs decide to kidnap and kill someone - maybe someone they think deserves it - during the middle of the night, with no one the wiser?<br/><br/>I find this kind of logic hard to apply to D&amp;D straight-up (particularly if we're concerned with game balance), but it's the kind of dynamic I would be interested in seeing with spell components in a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428010/#Comment_428010" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T12:34:15+00:00" title="February  5, 2014 12:34PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so that's more or less my experience too, it's more of color or a footnote rule that can be used to put an additional problem to the magic users and have them worried abouth something else from time to time, that might backfire a bit if the party learns to use it against NPC magic users that haven't prepared in the same way. Use it once and that's it.<br/><br/>Makes a ton more sense in a campaign with resource scarcity. Perhaps it's something that should make it's path into a random list of spell failure effects.<br/><br/>Anyway, I do like the idea of using material components a bit more heavily but in a very specific setting conditions/system hack:<br/>-Low level campaign, or one with a slow level progression.<br/>-More OSR oriented, perhaps with a simplified character creation method.<br/>-No spellcasters, but anybody can use magic if they learn how to make the somatic/verbal component somehow and has access to the material components, which now could become part of the loot.<br/><br/>Anybody tried/heard of something similar? Any setting or module that has tried this?

The components become an integral requirement/part of their task. You don't track them, because they only become an issue when you're attempting a ritual.

You don't need them to cast the ritual, but you need them to make the ritual easier to cast. By default, rituals are crazy difficult to cast.<br/><br/>This puts all the onus on the player to find components that make sense for the ritual. Now the rules don't have to say that <i>spider climb</i> requires a piece of bitumen. Instead, if you want to cast a ritual that lets you climb like a spider, you have to be creative and suggest that a piece of sticky bitumen added to your ritual gains you a +2 casting bonus from <i>affinity</i>. Then it's a side quest to find some bitumen.<br/><br/>It's all about the side quests. Components aren't interesting unless they generate adventure.<br/><br/>I'll go so far as to say that (at least in D&amp;D), <i>Nothing about your character is interesting unless it generates adventure.</i> Want to name a law of gaming after me? That one.<br/><br/>Really, that's the philosophy behind my suggested spell system. It's a spell system that generates the kind of adventure PCs already want to go on. It furthers play in the same direction as everything else. The spellbooks are dungeons. The spells are monsters.

I am confident that barring entirely intentional and ludicrous changes, it would be impossible to take a pre-3rd edition text of D&amp;D and manage to unbalance it by messing about with the material components of magic. It's already so unbalanced in such a multitude of ways that I can't imagine anybody managing to make it more so by accident.

I think we're just looking at the same thing from a different angle. For instance:\n<blockquote>the absolutely worst thing you might accomplish by trying out new material component rules is that you discourage anybody from playing magic-users (or encourage everybody to play magic-users) until you reverse the changes.</blockquote>\nThat's precisely the kind of issue I'm talking about. I can see it being a pretty minor issue in a game like yours, but a pretty major issue in, say, a carefully-balanced later-edition D&amp;D game which is mostly setpiece combat. If your version of D&amp;D includes balanced encounters expected to deplete 25% of a level-appropriate group's hit points, but now you've decided that the wizard's useful combat spells can't work without a virgin sacrifice, something's not going to work the way you've been used to it working.<br/><br/>This can play into more meta-level concerns, as well, however, like having to spend a great deal of time at the table dealing with the party's wizard's material component issue (tracking, expending, restocking) in order to be an effective dungeoneering team, while (let'say) the group Fighter is left with nothing to do but wait.<br/><br/>These are not particularly difficult challenges to solve, of course; I'm just pointing out that they exist.<br/><br/>The reason I find the kind of logic I outlined above difficult to apply to "straight-up D&amp;D" has to do with a real mix of these issues. If your Detect Magic spell requires a component which you've made into a problematic campaign setting issue (like an illegal, addictive drug which attracts monsters, and is considered sacred by a local cult), you're not necessarily going to have a great time playing the -same encounter-by-encounter-fight-the-next-monster-and-disarm-that-trap-before-you-run-out-of-hit-points D&amp;D you were used to: you're changing the direction of the game pretty dramatically.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428033/#Comment_428033" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T14:27:22+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  2:27PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2014 2:27PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I'm curious: when you talk about the player-GM negotiation maintaining balance, are you talking about tweaking the rules, tweaking the fiction to avoid situations where the rules would make a mess of things, both, or neither?<br/><br/>I've had plenty of success negotiating balance <i>without</i> old D&amp;D rules in the picture, but <i>with</i> them, I found the mechanics to be central to balance (i.e. we <i>had to change the rules</i> for the Tunnel spell and tons of other stuff).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428036/#Comment_428036" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T15:01:32+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  3:01PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean a very simple thing when I discuss negotiation as the means of balancing challenges: the GM comes to the table with a proposed challenge ("Hey, do you want to attempt to escort <i>this</i> caravan over <i>this</i> desert with <i>these</i> resources you have, to win <i>this</i> reward?"), and the other players have a real negotiation position from which they can approach the suggested challenge. A game in which such a negotiation position consistently exists ("You can actually say no to this caravan and do something else, if you think that it's too dangerous or too little of a reward.") is essentially locally, dynamically balanced: if the players get into something that is over their heads, then that's on them, and if they get into something that proves easy, then good for them and isn't it a relief. (In practice it's of course not quite that simple; most challenges, the vast majority of them, <i>adapt</i> naturally via discourse and process of play, meaning that challenges that prove absolutely too hard or absolutely too easy in hindsight only happen once in a blue moon.)<br/><br/>A game in which the players do not have a real-world negotiation position on whether they'll engage the challenge imposes a moral duty on the GM: if this game is to be fun for the players, I have to make it so that this challenge I'm planning is just so, suitably challenging without being unfairly overwhelming. (Note that this does not need to have anything to do with illusionism, simulationism or other stuff like that; you can have a challenging, hardcore gamist game without negotiated balance, even if I suspect that other solutions are not as good for adventure rpgs specifically.) As you can see, the need for game balance directly follows from the reduction of player rights; the infantilized players who cannot themselves determine the fates of their characters quite rightly expect that the GM takes full responsibility for the fun.<br/><br/>This dynamic process of balance obviously won't work on new-style D&amp;D. It's not so much a mechanical issue as an issue of procedure, as the content is prepped wrong, chargen is done wrong, campaign framework is developed wrong, reward cycles are wrong, player psychology is wrong... (I'm not attacking your favourite game, I just mean wrong for the purposes of using dynamic negotiated encounter balancing.) You can just about strip down 3rd edition by ignoring the vast majority of its own procedures and replacing them with old-school ones to implement negotiated balance; with 4th edition I suspect that it's impossible, but some sort of hybrid solution might be possible with massive prep.<br/><br/>Regarding how rules play into this, I don't consider them a balance issue in the kind of game that uses negotiated balance: you can set up e.g. the magic system in full accord with your aesthetic sensibilities, both mechanical and fictive, and then just let the cards fall as they may. If the resulting mechanical environment is such that Tunnel makes underground dungeons trivial, well, it's time to negotiate on some new challenges then. "Now that you have conclusively proved that in this campaign setting a traditional dungeon is an idiotic prospect thanks to the Tunnel spell, how about we see what's up with those wacky left coast pirates? I've got this new array of challenging maritime adventures here, and I think that if you'll either have your characters travel there, or create new ones, you'll find that Tunnel is not the end-all solution to all problems."<br/><br/>I should note that my disbelief in the need for a meaningful mechanical "balance" doesn't mean that I think that a lop-sided (I use that term specifically to differentiate from the theoretical connotations of "balance") milieu of any sort is necessarily a good idea; it just has nothing to do with game balance, and everything to do with framing an interesting and varied challenge environment. I mean, you can totes play in a setting where Paladins get all the coolest bling-bling, and the player characters don't even need to be paladins themselves (just look at Star Wars), or just some of them might be paladins, but if you go into ludicrous extremes, then interesting, fictionally flavourful challenges start disappearing: "We will again have our paladin PCs journey to the point of contention and use their annihilation beams on any resistance. Meanwhile, these other characters in my stable decide that they want to be paladins as well, so they go sign up for the correspondence course."<br/><br/>Also, I of course agree with Paul: if you're playing 3rd or 4th edition, and reading the rulebook like it was a combination of the US Constitution and the Bible in terms of authority, fully believing that the only moral succor for the GM is that when anything goes wrong he was "just following the rules!", then it is a patently bad idea to mess about with the mechanical details. Not only will you lose the moral protection of "just following the rules!", but you also run a pretty good chance of causing a lot of frustrating busywork for everybody. Perhaps the worst part is that the relationship of the players to the characters and setting is so different in those games: by nerfing wizards you're personally attacking this guy who's sitting at the table so they get to play a wizard, and they've been grinding to get to Nth level, dreaming of unleashing their magical might, and now you took away their toys, and you're a total asshole for doing that. In that sort of environment it is indeed deeply problematic to install more elaborate and interesting material component rules. As Paul correctly surmises, my comment was just a counter-example of a style of D&amp;D where the problems range from insignificant to nonexistent.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428039/#Comment_428039" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T15:38:44+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  3:38PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2014 3:42PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with you on offering multiple mission options; been doing that for years.<br/><br/>This here is the part I was wondering about:\n<blockquote>(In practice it's of course not quite that simple; most challenges, the vast majority of them, <i>adapt</i> naturally via discourse and process of play, meaning that challenges that prove absolutely too hard or absolutely too easy in hindsight only happen once in a blue moon.)</blockquote>I've found that certain mechanics can make adaptation more difficult, and "too hard" or "too easy" more likely.

They've got a party of like a dozen armed people, escorting a caravan of 40 camels and 20 handlers. Suddenly, the forward scout the party wisely set for the caravan comes cantering in, warning them that N members of a local robber clan are lurking at the cliff pass, cutting them off from the safety of the oasis (which is, of course, controlled by civilized people who will provide security for passing caravans).<br/><br/>How many bandits are there, and how this influences the nature of the challenge? In a challenge-negotiating game the GM does not determine the number based on what would provide the challenge that he wants; rather, he will determine that according to the demographics, logistics, and his understanding of the social dynamics of this particular caravan route in this particular setting, it makes sense for there to be say 4d20 outlaws.<br/><br/>Let's say the GM rolls 4 outlaws, rolling '1' on each individual die. The scout says that he could only spot a couple of suspicious-looking spotters, but he suspects that there has to be more of them out there. The party debate the matter and decide that they'll need to send a hard-hitting heavy scouting party in advance of the caravan to find out the extent of the danger. They might or might not realize that that a low number of outlaws could be scouting for a larger force stashed somewhere a bit farther - it could be that the nomads have a camp a couple of miles out, say. All this means that the challenge has now been defined: can the PCs find out that the danger is actually not there, and can they prevent the escape of the 4 outlaws? If they can, then no big deal (although approaching and apprehending 4 local bush rangers is no mean task for a scouting party); if they can't, the GM will probably roll another check to see if the escaping bandits did, indeed, warn their friends, potentially bringing in a larger encounter in a couple of hours or couple of days.<br/><br/>However, what if the GM rolls the average result, giving him roughly 40 outlaws? That's a pretty respectable force, probably more than what the adventurers can outfight, assuming their party is of low-level and essentially equal to 1 HD ordinary men. Their scout will e.g. state that they noticed some enemy spotters, but they were themselves seen as well, and they saw nomad cavalry on the dunes. The players decide that they will have to attempt something risky to succeed here, so they order the caravan to start to immediately backtrack, while the escort party chooses a defensive position from which to treat with the bandits; if they can make the bandits believe that they're a disinteresting heavily armed yet poor troupe, they might get an opening for a surprise attack, or an opportunity to take the caravan to the last ford, where they can choose a different route and hopefully avoid the bandit nomads without them being any wiser. In the worst case they might have to overcome 4:1 odds in their impromptu defensive position, in which case let's hope they have a magic-user with <i>Sleep</i>, or at least enough sense to throw down their weapons rather than get killed.<br/><br/>Furthermore, what if the GM rolls 80 outlaws, the maximum? That's a large force, and should the PCs find out the truth before it's too late, they will likely determine that they have no chance of success against it. The options are stark: either sacrifice themselves (likely their lives, certainly their freedom) to delay the bandits, attempt to have the caravan scatter behind the dunes so that maybe some of them might escape, attempt to escape the environs before the bandits become aware of the situation, or stone-cold escape with their own skins and leave the heavily-laden camels and mules to their own devices.<br/><br/>What was the point of my listing these alternate outcomes? It is to illustrate how challenge adaptation happens naturally in a negotiation-oriented game: while in some other game like say 3rd edition D&amp;D the GM pre-designs encounters where the appropriate strategic choice is to attack immediately (and thus there is, in fact, no real strategic layer to the game: 3rd edition D&amp;D is generally railroaded, and for good reason), here no such guarantees have been given; it is up to the players themselves to plan their intelligence gathering, determine the nature of the opposition, and then choose their goals depending on the facts on the ground and their own tactical senses.<br/><br/>I could illustrate this same thing in reverse as well, by having the challenge itself be static while comparing it to parties of different strength: will the troll under the bridge prove reason enough to turn back altogether (can we turn back, or are more drastic solutions necessary?), or a risky proposition for combat, or a relaxed roleplaying encounter, because our party can totally take a troll with our eyes closed? Depends on the party, and how that party themselves measures their means against the troll.<br/><br/>The most important point that I hope to have demonstrated by the above is that when a game text tells you that encounter balance is key to fun play, it is outright lying insofar as the general adventure rpg scheme is concerned: I just took three inordinately differently-strengthed bandit encounters (4, 40 and 80 bandits), and sketched in quick terms how the party might approach the situation to make for a meaningful and exciting series of events in each case. It simply is not the case that a reasonably structured, fluid game needs balancing challenges in advance; what it merely needs is a sufficient flexibility of play (something that rpgs are known for!), so that the players can redefine their goals depending on the situation. Encounter balance is only ever a problem if you don't allow this natural rebalancing to occur, by insisting that all encounters have to conform to a model of an instant heroic charge followed by quick mop-up. That's how 4th edition D&amp;D works, and that's why it can't use dynamic, negotiation-based balance in its procedure of play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428041/#Comment_428041" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T16:21:00+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  4:21PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2014 4:21PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious about this, too.

Really, I could tell anything at all from our last session of play, and it would likely involve dynamic challenge adaptation in some way.<br/><br/>Like, in the last session of <i>Stonehell</i> (it's this minimalistic megadungeon) that we played we faced the challenge of scouting the 2nd level of the dungeon to find out what kind of place it is, and whether the wizard's laboratory we are seeking might be in that direction. For resources we had four Persian NPC fighters with somewhat similar goals,  3 PCs and about 5-ish henchmen - a total of about a dozen 0-1 level characters.<br/><br/>Thing is, however, that the way to the 2nd floor tends to be guarded by a tribe of underpeople, and we haven't yet really formed solid relations with them, so this entire plan is a bit sketchy - if we go to 2nd floor and then the underpeople e.g. bar the stairs back up, we'll be stuck on the 2nd floor for good.<br/><br/>This prospective goal of ours, to scout the 2nd floor to get a sense of what's going on there, that's under negotiation in this sort of situation. The referee may, should they feel like it, be proactive in this sort of negotiation, but in this case Heikki had no need to be: we have very sharp goal-orientation in what we're doing, and we had alternatives, so Heikki mostly just had to sit and wait for us to figure out whether we'd want to try this, and how.<br/><br/>An important facet of our manpower situation is that the Persians are not just following us around, rather they're mapping the dungeon at a ridiculously slow speed and detail. We like having them around because we have the same security interests in not getting eaten by a grue, but the differing goals mean that we can't have them for everything we do. For example in this case, the Persians are quite clear in that they want to map the dungeon in order, and they're not going to the 2nd floor before they've mapped the first, which'll take several more days at their speed.<br/><br/>A very important point in our negotiation of the challenge came when we went to see the underpeople with the Persians, and it proved that the underpeople were <i>much</i> more manageable than we'd been fearing. My character as the party diplomat (Anaxandros knows all languages, that's his thing) got along surprisingly well with the underpeople. This meeting encouraged us to try the 2nd floor: we were like 85% sure that the underpeople wouldn't become hostile on our way back (always a tricky thing, but particularly so if you have any injured or other weakness), so we could detach the Persians and proceed to the 2nd floor with our local forces.<br/><br/>What makes this into negotiation, why do I call it that? Well, it's negotiation in that we have alternatives (we could have gone into the mausoleums, or tried to talk the underpeople into letting us cross their territory to who knows where), and we're attempting to balance risks and rewards against our resources. The reveal about the attitudes of the underpeople was ultimately what sold us on the plan to go to 2nd floor in the last session. It's not negotiation in the sense that the GM would have actively and intentionally attempted to lure us to 2nd floor, but it is negotiation in that the elements of the fiction, as they are established, influence the decision-making, and adventure may only begin once we've discovered a viable adventure to run: had the 2nd floor been out of reach in our current situation, we would have had to look for something else to do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, you can also see challenge adaptation constantly going on in this snippet from our last session: relying on the Persians all the time would be too easy, which is why the referee is taking their commitment to slow mapping so seriously; meanwhile we agree that it's too easy, and therefore are not being stubborn about waiting around for the Persians to finish their maps so we can take them with us to the 2nd floor. In other words, the challenge has been adapted by reducing the forces we take to the 2nd floor. If we didn't have any henchmen, we would stick to the Persians like glue, or go find some poor fools to accompany us into the dungeon, all in an effort to negotiate/adapt the fictional matter into a balanced challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428044/#Comment_428044" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T18:22:50+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  6:22PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2014 6:23PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my stab at what's required for this sort of play:<br/>1) The opportunity to opt in at <i>all</i> levels of challenge.  Not just the mission (macro), but also the encounter (micro).<br/>2) The ability to acquire enough info to make <i>informed</i> opt-in decisions.<br/>3) A procession of <i>many</i> available challenges; if you opt out of this one, or find a clever way to render it easy, don't worry -- there'll be another one soon.<br/><br/>Would you agree?<br/><br/>In this schema, sure, an unbalanced Tunnel spell, despite maybe having a huge impact at a given moment, will have an overall negligible effect on the flow of finding and facing challenges (unless Tunnel is good for <i>everything</i>, as you said with the paladin annihilation beams).<br/><br/>I've run this sort of game, but I find there's frequent pressure to mutate it in another direction:<br/>1) GMs who manage a world tend to develop some authorial vision.  Suspending this instinct on the macro mission level is easier than on the micro encounter level.  Once the players agree to tackle bandits, the GM will often form an expectation of a bandit encounter.  If the players opt out or find an easy way around, the GM will be very disappointed, and will endeavor to make future expected encounters less optional.<br/>2) GMs who prep challenges don't want that prep wasted.  Most D&amp;D GMs I've met do some prep.  Same problem as above.<br/>3) "Boom, the challenge jumps on you, what do you do?!" is a common GM instinct.  No opt-out or alternatives this time.  If it's too hard or too easy, you're stuck with it.<br/>4) Not every GM is adept as signalling the relevant factors when they're needed.  "Oops, I forgot to come up with a way to make it clear there's loot up there," or "Oops, I forgot to show that the cave is actually just a death trap for bottlenecking purposes, not an alternate route," are common in my experience, especially when challenges are ad-libbed rather than prepped.<br/><br/>Have you encountered these problems?  Found any solutions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428046/#Comment_428046" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T18:59:45+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  6:59PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you on all points of your analysis.<br/><br/>I combat the authorial vision thing by generally being extremely cynical of literary ambitions related to D&amp;D worlds. I ran a campaign for two years on nothing except improvisation, disregard for geography, and an endless flow of historical anecdotes. I'm sure that it helps that ours is a generally pretty culture-associated circle of gamers; we don't have those frustrated authors, because if we want to be authors we <i>write a book</i> instead of playing the game.<br/><br/>I combat the prep issue by prepping tools (instead of prepping an adventure, prep a random table of adventures), and by using a wide array of stuff other people have created. I find that as long as you don't have your authorial vision tripping you up, you can find an unlimited amount of creative material that can be easily riffed off for your campaign. When I was running the sandbox myself a while back, I generally had something like a dozen adventure modules or such at my fingertips; that might sound like a lot of work, but if you've read the adventures earlier, you really don't need to worry about them for years at a time until they're finally used. The players actually chew through a relatively small amount of material in detail as the campaign progresses, so you need that reserve to be able to provide options and fill the world, but merely because you'd be wasting anything; any good stuff that doesn't get used today will just get a new chance tomorrow, up until the players specifically tap that stuff and either consume it or deny it.<br/><br/>(Compare with Jim Raggi: the poor guy is pretty aesthetically picky about what he runs, so he actually has to work from week to week to prep something new for each session, and generally speaking his campaign has to run on a string-of-pearls model for it.)<br/><br/>I combat the issue of sudden, unavoidable challenge by working with the players to develop an intimate sense for how the setting works, and by talking with them straight about the potential dangers involved in doing this or that, to whatever degree their characters would know about the matter. I also strive to be "constructive" in developing challenges, which is a principle wherein you make choices that are actually challenging (that is, set choices on the players), instead of choices that are non-challenging. Because of this constructiveness principle I rarely run into a situation where the players can do nothing except roll the dice and die (that's not very challenging), and when we do come up with that sort of a situation, the players always had theoretical prospects for expecting the danger and preparing accordingly, because the setting is not "wizard did it" - things happen causally and realistically, generally speaking, and even when you go into the unknown, you <i>know</i> that you're going into the unknown.<br/><br/>For example (because that was possibly not as clear as it could have been), the traditional "boom you're dead" challenge is a trapped corridor. However, in my conceptualization of D&amp;D it's not the corridor or the trap that's the challenge, but rather the risk-management of going into a place that could have traps in the first place. For this reason, given that we've properly shivered at the prospect of penetrating the mummy's tomb, it's no longer a violation if a character steps into a trap and dies, just like that; they knew that they were on hostile ground, and should maybe have chosen differently in earlier stages of the process that led to their death. So having a trap is not a problem because a trap is not a challenge, theoretically speaking; for it to be a challenge is not enough for it to be something you dice over; dice are incidental, a challenge lives in the choices the players make.<br/><br/>Regarding your last issue, of signalling... I guess I avoid that by fostering a consistent communication scheme and a hygienic method of adventure design. The hygienic method is that you don't design for functional teleological purpose: you don't design a corridor to be a bottleneck, or specifically hint at treasure - those are all methods of a GM who's taking sides in the matter. With proper hygiene you just show what is there, in a way that makes sense, and let the players determine where they look for treasure or whatever. You're not responsible for that part of play! (I exclaim because I find this important; it truly is the most important difference between old school and trad playstyles, that the old school game presumes that the players are equally responsible for the outcomes.)<br/><br/>Of course you sometimes make mistakes in e.g. explaining things clearly enough. In those situations you apologize and go on, trying to do better; when something of import was affected, perhaps you'll negotiate an extra saving roll or something to make up for your error. And of course the entire group understands two things: 1) you are human, and therefore fallible, and 2) the proper procedure is up to the players as well as the GM, and thus they share in the error to some degree when the GM forgets something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428055/#Comment_428055" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T03:11:53+00:00" title="February  6, 2014  3:11AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just here to +1 Eero's posts. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428059/#Comment_428059" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T05:41:03+00:00" title="February  6, 2014  5:41AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is off topic from the original post but: I'm convinced, <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>.
