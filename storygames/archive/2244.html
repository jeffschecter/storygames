You mean Brennan, right? Or did he have a friend helping out? I think his wife helps out in some ways, occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
It's really just Brennan, I think. I don't think I'm betraying some trust by making this public. I think that Brennan does an astoundingly good job for a one man operation.<br/>
<br/>
The point, however, is that if he's ill, or out of town, or...well anything that would keep you or I from work...then "IPR" is unavailable until he's back. So I'd say that a little patience might be in order.<br/>

                            There may well be a second guy... seems to ring a bell. Though I could be thinking of Key20 (I think Jason might have a guy, or his wife helps out full time or something). Or of Key20 when it was Jason and Jason Blair.<br/>

                            From a thread called <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/forum/index.php?topic=372.0" rel="nofollow">Shipping Problems</a> from the IPR forums, Brennan says:
<blockquote>Hey, everyone! As you can probably tell from the rash of "My Order" posts on this portion of the forum, there were some issues with fulfillment at the beginning of this year. Here's why:<br><br>IPR has just switched to a new warehouse and fulfillment center, and there was some delay as all the stock got shipped to the new location. After this, there were some predictable kinks to work out of the shipping situation, which should all be resolved now.<br><br>Until recently, I was filling orders by myself, and the volume had grown to a level that I could only get to it on Saturdays. With the new arrangement, we can get two shipments out a week, which will help with delivery times.<br><br/>Unfortunately, there was another mixup with some of these orders and they were sent media mail, rather than priority mail as IPR usually does. This means there will be a few more days added into the delivery time on some of these.<br/><br/>All of the orders from Jan 1 through Jan 16 have now been shipped, however, and will be arriving soon! Sorry for the delays, but these problems won't be repeated.<br/><br/>Thanks for ordering!</br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>
Plus all the rest.<br/><br/>You may wanna try posting to the <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">forum</a>, on the off-chance that your emails aren't getting through or something, also.                        </div>

                            Hey, everybody! It was a confluence of evil influences. I switched to a new fulfillment house, as mentioned above, at the first of the year, but I think we have all the issues there worked out. Then, I spent all last weekend feverishly doing the 2006 books (accounting is the reason I got into RPG publishing!), and I had a big project due this week at my day job and didn't get to e-mails in as timely a manner as I usually do.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a big list of excuses! The upshot is, I am sorry about the poorer-than-usual shipping times and customer service, but it should not be repeated.                        </div>
