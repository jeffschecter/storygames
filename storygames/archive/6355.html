But 1) there are already at least two Doctor Who RPGs out there, and 2) you don't have the rights to the IP.<br/><br/>How far can you go? Can you expect a cease-and-desist letter if you post a free PDF on your site? Has anyone ever done anything like this? Most of the indie games I run across are created from whole cloth, but surely someone has designed and published something along these lines...<br/><br/>Of course, I know that there are few lawyers here, and I'll probably consult with one before I start actual work on this pet project. But, just wondering. Thanks!<br/><br/>-- Rafael                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140710/#Comment_140710" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T15:39:53+00:00" title="April 21, 2008  3:39PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/projects/avatar/" rel="nofollow">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> game, despite being unfinished, gets the most hits of anything on my website.  It's been up for over a year, maybe two, and I've never heard anything from anyone.  Really, it depends on the IP holders and how big an internet suppression campaign they run.  In general, though:<br/><br/>1. If you do HTML and not PDF, I doubt you'll ever hear anything.<br/><br/>2. If you do PDF download, you probably run a higher chance of receiving a cease &amp; desist letter.  But it still might never come.  Definitely avoid distribution through another source, like RPGnow or IPR, even if you're giving it away for free.  Link to it from your website.<br/><br/>3. The only way I can imagine you actually getting sued is if you started selling something with someone else's IP in it.<br/><br/>This is just the common practice of the internet nowadays, as I see it; not real legal advice.  I say go for it, but don't sell it and, if you want to be extra careful, just put it up on a webpage, in an attractive format that's easy to print out.  Or go for a free PDF and see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25" title="vertigo25"><img alt="vertigo25" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://vertigo25.com/junk/supesavatar-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25">vertigo25</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140716/#Comment_140716" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T16:13:30+00:00" title="April 21, 2008  4:13PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothing really to add to the actual topic... truth be told, I wish I knew the answer, too (I think, really it depends on the lawyers who bravely protect the particular property... Paramount got all upity back in the early days of internet fanfic, for instance, wheras Joss Whedon seems to not mind as long as you're not trying to sell it). I also wish I knew how one would actually secure a *real* license to do commercial work. I'd love to make something for, say, Francesca Lia Block's work (along with about a hundred other things).<br/><br/>What I mainly wanted to ask, though, is if Rafael is aware that there's a new Doctor Who RPG coming out.<br/><br/>It's by <a href="http://www.cubicle-7.com/" rel="nofollow">Cubicle 7</a> and judging from some of the comments made by the developers on RPG.net, it looks like it may be pretty good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140721/#Comment_140721" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T16:38:33+00:00" title="April 21, 2008  4:38PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, heard about that.
