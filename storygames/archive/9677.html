I'd say that aerobic/anaerobic, with regard to Story Now, sounds like the difference in immediacy between Dead Like Me and Six Feet Under - in one, the character has to deal with death because she herself suddenly dies, and then is causing it. In the other, the character's father dies, and he inherits the funeral home run by the family.<br/>Well... even then, both of the relevant deaths that kick things off happen in the first episode, so it is pretty up-front.<br/>It sounds like apples and apples, more or less.<br/>The examples of "anaerobic" you use sound like bad writing, IMO <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Sounds like the main character from Dead Like Me and Rosie Cotton from LotR, respectively!<br/>*reads some relevant articles*<br/>OK, sounds like anaerobic is what Ron has called "97%ing", which is when the conflict is almost resolved when the story begins. That's filed under dysfunctional Story Now play, because it takes all the fun out. Super-extensive backgrounds that leave little room for development, or just a character with a very clear track that the player is loath to deviate from - - the character is at 97%, and is almost all done.<br/>Yeah, right there with you on this.<br/>Secondly, what the hell is up with BW's BITs? Traits I get, but Beliefs and Instincts seem like things you should figure out as you go, unless you have one hell of a well-determined ... character... hm. I'm having a thought.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that this is why BW was called "Timid Virgin" play - so much thought on thematic stuff has to happen before play begins that you may end up asking yourself "what's left?" provided you can even get that far. I had a hell of a time coming up with B's and I's for sample character creation that I've done; where am I basing this, exactly, but for the most generic, derivative "um, okay. Orcs. Okay, what do they believe...? Hmmmm" thought processes. Blech <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Wow, glad to know that folks know about 97%ing! I mean, anaerobic play!<br/><br/>Anaerobic = bad writing. Almost worthy of a sig!<br/><br/>***on another note, have you been reading my thread about my Greek game? (apologies if you've commented and I forgot that you have ^_^) I ask because I was thinking that players could start with up to two "colored dice" to add some Hubris and Aegis to their skills. If I left that starting number open as a "dial" for the group to determine, then the number of "tweaked" dice you get at the start would translate into how quickly the characters are visited by the gods or, well, smitten by them.

Sure, you can tell you're emotionally manipulated, but you still get close to tears in almost every 20 minute episode, by the time it ends. You just need to be a really good writer for it not to come off as Deus Ex Machina. I think what they do there is not exactly anaerobic actually, they just try to push the "Aerobic" into 15 minutes instead of into 300.<br/><br/>The thing about serieses like Six Feet Under and why it's aerobic is not because you don't have the theme not-front loaded, but because the theme and more importantly, its <i>resolution</i> do not occur almost immediately, the 3%. You have a kicker, and then you spend a long long time exploring it, rather than the kicker being the starting point and the end-point being in sight (anaerobic), the kicker is the starting point of a long journey.<br/>Think of it as the Oddyssey, sure there is a kicker and the theme of journey is present from the get-go, but it is only fully realized and explored after, well, an oddyssey! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>The thing about Burning Wheel is likewise: First, Beliefs and Instincts can change, and there's an advice to only write the last instinct and belief after the first session, when you see where your character is at. Think of instinct mostly as something that describes the character's personality, it shows you what they're like, indirectly.<br/>As for beliefs, don't think of them as themes that happen, but as motivators. They are what gets you ON the journey, they in no way resolve the journey, or tell you if the theme will be resolved or subverted.<br/><br/>A character can have the belief of "I will bring down the King, my father's killer." and then they will begin a campaign trying to realize that, but if they debase themselves to worse than the king in their endeavours, the character(s) are engaging in a game where the theme is not only revenge, but revenge at all costs, or turning into a monster to stop another. And should they fail to kill the king, then the theme is subverted, and becomes one of a failed revenge.<br/><br/>Unless you create all your beliefs so that they could be resolved ASAP, it's a far cry from anaerobic. It's front-loaded in another sense: You get to see what the themes are from the get-go, you get to strive towards them from the word "Go!", but you don't get to realize them, not just the goals, but the themes, immediately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214984/#Comment_214984" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T01:43:25+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  1:43AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How does this concept apply to games that are intentionally short in their time frame?<br/>A film only has so much time to work with, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214986/#Comment_214986" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T01:51:02+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  1:51AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 1:52AM by Thunder_God.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think films work in percents: This part of the movie will be exposition, where we introduce the theme and/or twist of normal life. This part would be exploring how things change as a result of this twist.<br/>Then we get two minutes of everything going to hell, and then the last 30 minutes are the real movie, where you get issues being resolved, whether the theme is subverted or accepted, where you get emotional moments that were lead up to slowly with build-up from before.<br/><br/>Funny thing is, it almost always is 30 minutes, whether the movie is 90 minutes or 150 minutes long.<br/><br/>In a game, perhaps something like Robert Bohl's game, <a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a> with its classical plot development. Have the game have these sections, and specify how much of your session, or how many scenes, each part should have.<br/><br/>In a movie, it all goes into stretching, or in a sense, the opposite. Giving each scene as much meaningfulness and making it relevant to as many future-moments as possible. Or just focusing on a narrow theme and cutting down on the non-major characters. When all you have are 4 characters in a movie, or 3 (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775529" rel="nofollow">The Savages</a> where it's 2.5), it's much easier to have every scene relevant to all the characters later, than when you have two dozen and most look the same (I so couldn't tell the difference between different characters/actors in Black Hawk Down).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214989/#Comment_214989" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T02:42:40+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  2:42AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just had a thought, regarding a particular tool I see in TV shows and movies, which I'm not entirely for when it occurs in RPGs.<br/><br/>I like to call it "The Inexorable March to Inevitibility". Or they show you the bait, and instead of giving you a "switch", they keep baiting you with switches that never occur.<br/><br/>You see a bad thing is going to happen to someone who doesn't deserve it, usually not the protagonist but someone for whom they care, the "Innocent NPC". And then they show you how things build up towards it, and you keep saying to yourself, "If only they knew they didn't do that..." and "Ok, here's a chance for them to realize their mistake!" and it never happens. The shit-storm continues to near the undeserving and often unintended target, and by the time it hits, you are attached to what has happened in a way you wouldn't be had they shown the mistake/beginning and the shit-storm hitting the poor target.<br/><br/>In a TV show, it usually takes 20-35 minutes, or an RPG session, in a movie it takes 5-7 minutes. But in both cases it's something of an aerobic tool, building the theme, but in one it's compressed. In the movie version, I'd guess I'd have it be a montage-esque narration by someone who tells you all the attempts that fail, or something.<br/><br/>I'm not really for this in general in an RPG if you have it be inevitable by mechanics, because while in the story it's all written by one person and I know the strings are there (and I hope not to see them), in an RPG I get to see the strings, and I'd rather not have the strings shoved in my face every time I realize it's inevitable.<br/>Then the theme is more in the retelling, where the strings of the mechanics fade from the foreground and you're left with the thematic inexorable march towards the inevitable of the undeserving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215009/#Comment_215009" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T07:05:32+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  7:05AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 8:13AM by timfire.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OH FOR THE LOVE OF GAWD PLEASE DONT START USING SUCH STUPID AND COMPLETELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TERMS!!!<br/><br/><i>ok... that's out of my system now...</i><br/><br/>Seriously, why are you making up terms to describe play styles we already have terms for? If I hadn't caught the other thread I would have absolutely no idea what "aerobic" and "anaerobic" is suppose to refer to. Just call them "front-loaded (theme)" vs "emergent (theme)", it's immediately clear what those terms are describing.<br/><br/>This isn't a new phenomenon, this distinction has been talked about for a number of years now. Prior to maybe '04-'05, an emergent style was pretty much the default, but since then front-loaded designs have become the norm among indie games.<br/><br/>Emergent play is much, much more emotionally fulfilling than front-loaded play. PERIOD. The down side---it takes a lot more time and setting it up takes some additional skill, compared with front-loaded play.<br/><br/>Front-loaded play has become popular for a couple reasons, but the big one is probably the time issue. You can jump right into the heat of it all in a single session, rather than waiting 3-4 sessions for the drama to simply <i>get started</i>. In some ways, front-loaded play might be considered "easier", as you can just look at the charsheet or in the game book to see what issues you're suppose to be addressing, rather than waiting and nurturing potential issues in play, which takes a certain skill to do well.<br/><br/>I also don't want to give the impression that front-loaded is "bad"---front-loaded play can be very good, as evident by the wide array of games that utilize it. But it's very, very difficult to get the same type of visceral emotional reaction from front-loaded play that you can from emergent play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215011/#Comment_215011" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T07:18:35+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  7:18AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 7:19AM by timfire.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>I'd say that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">aerobic/anaerobic</span> [<b>emergent/front-loaded</b>], with regard to Story Now, sounds like the difference in immediacy between Dead Like Me and Six Feet Under...</blockquote>\nYou know, I'm normally big on comparing &amp; contrasting RPGs with traditional story-telling media, but this is one of those play issues where I don't think it's useful.

You can make a pretty good guess what "emergent/front-loaded" mean, but "aerobic/anaerobic" takes some explaining or at least a bit of thought. "Emergent/front-loaded" has some history, but by all means, if you can think of better terms, go ahead!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>I think that anaerobic role-playing are necessarily front-loaded, but front-loaded are not necessarily anaerobic.<br/>As can be seen from my discussion with Zac regarding presenting the themes from the get-go, I think you can present the themes, and then let them mature and nurture during play.

Are we just talking short-term vs long-term? If the answer is that with anaerobic play we don't develop issues in play, but in aerobic we do allow issues to evolve, then that sounds exactly like front-loaded/emergent to me.<br/><br/>Part of this debate is going to come down to how we decide to define and categorize certain phenomenon, and at the risk of arguing about words, I'm going to say that I don't think the phenomenon you're describing is really "front-loading".<br/><br/>Take something like Kickers in <i>Sorcerer</i>. That's often called "front-loading", but I don't think that's the case. A Kicker doesn't really define what dramatic issues are going to be addressed in play. Rather, they establish what you might call an "arena of conflict". The player is basically establishing thematic boundaries, and saying, "I'm interested in exploring any issue within these constraints, but everything else is off-limits".<br/><br/>I think a lot of the flag-type mechanics we see in games---including Keys---are intended to create these "arenas of conflict", rather than pre-define dramatic issues. I think they sometimes get used to pre-define issues, but that's not their sole purpose.<br/><br/>Again, though, that might just be arguing about words. Maybe you still want to call it "front-loading". Or maybe you would call it some sort of emergent/front-loaded hybrid.

I guess there was a flurry of discussions around November/December '05. Here are some highlights:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2005/11/to_the_land_of_.html" rel="nofollow">To the Land of Sudden Metaphors</a><br/><a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2005/11/dip_das_in_indi.html" rel="nofollow">DIP &amp; DAS in Indie Games: One Player's Experience</a><br/><a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2005/11/developing_stor.html" rel="nofollow">Developing Stories Through Play</a><br/><a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2005/12/qien_es_mas_mac.html" rel="nofollow">Qien Es Mas Macho?</a><br/><br/>It's interesting to read those old discussions. '05 was when the generic "Forge-style" game first really got established. You can tell some people simply weren't as used to that style of play as they are today.<br/><br/>"Front-loaded/emergent" was definitely part of the discussion, but general focus or intensity was also a factor in the "aerobic/anaerobic" distinction. "Anaerobic" play seemed to involve high-intensity bang-driven play, while "aerobic" play seemed to involve low-intensity, uh, "meandering" play, maybe.<br/><br/>Re-reading those discussions, I'm not sure the "aerobic/anaerobic" distinction---as defined back then---is really still relevant. The standard for what might be considered "front-loaded" or "emergent" ("developed in play", as they called it) is probably different now than it was back then. There is still a desire to get away from bang-driven play---just look up "structured freeform"---but it's my impression that the goal is to explore non-conflict play while maintaining a high degree of focus/intensity.<br/><br/>So it would seem to me that if you wanted to keep using the "aerobic/anaerobic" distinction, you would have re-define what the terms mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215114/#Comment_215114" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T13:45:23+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  1:45PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, I'm going to present my experience with the terms as two situations of fictional dialogue to illustrate the distinction. These are generally inspired by actual play events, but not verbatim or anything - I didn't have a recorder at the time. System is generally being left ambiguous here, but if you picture it as Primetime Adventures for the first one, you can't go wrong.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Situation 1: Anaerobic (formatting thanks to Vincent)<br/><br/>GM: Okay, so what kind of character do you want to play?<br/><br/>Player 1: Oh, I want a hardcore badass space marine.<br/><br/>GM: Awesome! What do you want the character's Issue to be?<br/><br/>Player 1: I think it'd be interesting if he had to deal with his insecurities, so I want him to doubt whether or not he's really useful to the rest of the team, making a contribution, is worthy, etc.<br/><br/>GM: Hey, great. Let's roll.<br/><br/>In the first session of this game, there are a few combats where Player 1's character is explicitly put in a position of having to doubt his contributions. An NPC also comes into play who is also a badass space marine, who seems to do a fair number of things just as well or better than Player 1's character. At the end of the session, Player 1's character drops the bomb to the other teammates that his character is going to quit the team. The other players generally expect this and go nuts when he pays off his pre-session banter.  Dramatic music. Credits.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Situation 2: Aerobic<br/><br/>GM: Okay, so what kind of character do you want to play?<br/><br/>Player 1: Oh, I want a hardcore badass space marine.<br/><br/>GM: Awesome! What do you want the character's issue to be? (yes, lowercase on purpose)<br/><br/>Player 1: Dude, I don't know. I don't even know who this guy is yet. I have to play him for a while first.<br/><br/>GM: Okay, cool.<br/><br/>The GM and players start the game by doing what's in their mandate, bopping around to different planets and solving problems in the name of the Star Expeditionary Corps. One of the NPCs in there somewhere is also a space marine that does things about as well or better than Player 1's character. Over time, combats happen and surrounding interpersonal interaction happens to where Player 1 realizes that his character is starting to become extremely concerned about his real worth to the team. This builds up to where several sessions into the game, Player 1's character drops the bomb to the other characters that he's quitting the team. The other players look back on the buildup and totally see it, and go nuts over the new story development. Dramatic music. Credits.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>This example only hits the tip of the iceberg, of course. I consider the distinctions not only useful, but potentially two different paradigms of Narrativist play. At least, I know folks invested strongly enough in the basic assumptions of each that the other way seems utterly wrong-headed to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215117/#Comment_215117" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T13:56:47+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  1:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 1:57PM by misuba.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People, if the terms' definitions can't fit into a post in <i>this thread,</i> they're too poorly defined to be useful and shouldn't be here.

A subtle but very important distinction. <br/><br/>I had this driven home in a fantastic Orcs-based campaign I ran last year. Two players were playing Orcs and had done a good job of staking out "this is stuff I think would be cool to do" type Beliefs: one player wanted his character to fight his way up the Orc tribal heirarchy, the other wanted to explore this kind of insane, bumbling persona he'd been thinking about as he went through creating a shaman character (which, in turn, was prompted by his desire to check out the magic system and see what it was all about).<br/><br/>The third guy, though, right? He has a troll character. The player actively dislikes how emotional attributes kind of pre-sketch the character's story arc so he didn't want to deal with Hatred. Also, he liked the monstrous stats and combat-focused skill set on the back end. Okay, cool -- I knew he was old-school and was prepared to accommodate him in the game. But here's the kicker: When it was time to come up with his Beliefs, he simply could not (maybe <i>would not</i>) approach them from a "what do I want my character to do" perspective. The only way he could get his head wrapped around Beliefs was from a "what would this troll care about?" perspective.<br/><br/>And it totally and completely fell apart.<br/><br/>There are, of course, a thousand reasons why this may have happened -- the different agenda in character creation was a red flag, certainly. But once we were actually in play and doing stuff, I'd facilitate good BW Best Practices type play and challenge his Troll's Beliefs. The player was completely and unrepentantly meh on the whole experience. Just because he thought he'd figured out what the troll "cared" about, the player could not make himself care about those same things.<br/><br/>So, anyway, a thought on the Belief concept. Thinking back on it, I have to wonder if the whole "what would my character think?" process was, in fact, just another form of play-before-play or 97% or whatever. I think there's a strong argument to be made that if you're coming at your Beliefs as a player (what do I want to explore?), you're much, much earlier in the process than if you come at your Beliefs as the character (i.e. you've already done the exploring, maybe).<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215211/#Comment_215211" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T20:55:37+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  8:55PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair point that it's the player's desires, not the character's actual beliefs, that I should focus on, but that doesn't really take away from the problem I have with the setup - maybe it's because I've only set up for one-player-one-GM games of BW, but it's just kind of tough to come up with ... okay, well, I just have a hard time setting aside *all* Actor stance in character creation, I suppose.<br/>Not that the character couldn't change over time; far from it.
