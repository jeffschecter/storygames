It was a blast. I facilitated/moderated all ten games, but only four players managed to actually play all ten: Lacey J., Daniel T., Daniel E., and Ronald R. Me and Mark U. played in six apiece.<br/><br/>We started off, an hour later than intended, playing Chris Bennett's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/151239/#Comment_151239" rel="nofollow">The Believers</a>. This game was a huge hit, and produced a delicate tone throughout, always somewhat creepy, but alternating as well between poignant and lightly funny. Highlights included hearing two sides of a panicked conversation about a possible space whale, a redneck's story about the abduction of his prized hunting dog, a stoner's paranoid testimony, and the sad, panicked tale of mistaken identity leading to an accidental shooting in the wake of the aliens' arrival. In the end, all but one of us chose to go with the aliens, despite their apparent penchant for replacing or changing their abductees.<br/><br/>The first game took a little over 30 minutes including learning the rules (our group moves slow and often gets caught up in digressions). My original plan had been 2 games per hour getting us done in 5 hours total, but we ended up taking 6 and a half hours to complete the ten. Which is... not that bad, all things considered.<br/><br/>Next up was Mathijs Holter's <a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/11/25/the-orc-in-the-well/" rel="nofollow">The Orc In the Well</a>. One thing we missed in our playthrough was the idea that the story should cover only about 15 minutes in our orc's life. There was a pretty early jump-cut to "later that afternoon" and then we had jumps of much much longer. As such, the story got a little more gonzo than intended, I think, but it was still a lot of fun. Our orc, a once-proud warrior named Throg, named each of the cursed slippery stones lining the well after all the warriors he had defeated in battle, made out with a frog, was for a time mocked by a sarcastic tree, and was haunted by dreams of an enemy prophet who had confused him with strange elliptical wisdom. Good times.<br/><br/>Our third game was <a href="http://gamepoems.gizmet.com/2010/07/game-poem-29-mask/" rel="nofollow">Mask </a>by Marc Majcher. We told the story of our group meeting and interacting with a strange new friend named Pat, who had just moved to Greeneville from New Mexico, believed they had an allergy to gluten, and for a while moved in with Daniel and Lacey. This game was a highlight actually, and seemed to highlight and illuminate certain things about our group's dynamics in a provocative and funny way. In the end, Mark, who intended the mask harm, was given the mask. He didn't destroy it, but he did annotate Pat's face with some of their goofier quotes. ("It's okay, I'm from New Mexico." Though my absolute favorite moments were the whole "I guess I'm a vegetarian now that I live with you guys" conversation with Lacey and the confrontation scene with Pat's unperturbed "Yeah, and I feel all itchy.") We assume Pat eventually stopped hanging out with us.<br/><br/>Fourth: <a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/going-galt/" rel="nofollow">Going Galt</a> by Anders Nygaard. This game didn't go over quite as well, and ended up derailing us for quite a while as we debated the merits of socialism and imagined the reverse game: Going Christ, in which the world increasingly rejects and isolates the main character, who eventually sacrifices themselves for the good of others. I think the game's didactism is part of the reason it didn't work well for us- it's a game that has a point to make, and worse for us, it's a point that everyone in our group already agrees with. Coming up with good scenes proved difficult, and without anything like a turn order or whatever a lot of us seemed kind of adrift. That said, I think the game does get it's message across very clearly, and does portray the shadow arc of the Galt fantasy; namely, a crazy narcissist gradually isolating themselves and becoming more and more unhinged.<br/><br/>The fifth game we played was <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/331203/#Comment_331203" rel="nofollow">The Perfect Caper</a>, also by Chris Bennett. This game didn't work quite as well, though I think it could be great with a little tweaking. One of our problems was a little mismatch of genre expectations, I think (our caper ended up being somewhat supernatural in nature) and some of our "things that went wrong" contradicted each other, though we managed to resolve most of those contradictions in conversation. One thing I did really like was how the monologues about how the criminals were going to spend their share of the loot humanized the characters very quickly and added just a tinge of pathos. By the end, as players were arguing out of turn about who screwed up the worst, I felt like the game and the scene were humming in a way that it hadn't up until that point, but then the immediate resolution felt a little flat, especially since it was pretty clear that all of us were ready to sell the others out for a pack of M&amp;Ms. Pretty fun, nonetheless.<br/><br/>(continued below...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445826/#Comment_445826" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-28T19:27:42+00:00" title="June 28, 2015  7:27PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2015 7:53PM by amphigorist.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Up next was <a href="https://leaveittome.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/when-the-giant-comes/" rel="nofollow">When the Giant Comes</a> by Dave Cleaver. The planning sequence was a lot of fun, the sensual details were great ("the taste of liquid courage"), but I felt like the execution section faltered. I think maybe it would be better if there was a little more guidance for the players who take on the role of the giant, and the simple die mechanic can lead to some very flat results (we basically rolled 4-6s all the way around, leading to a pretty uneventful march to the giant's doom). I don't think I put enough focus on the idea of creating a whimsical sort of plan, as what we came up with was pretty straightforward. Passing around the map of the plan was great (I let everyone who wanted add details to the giant), though again I didn't put enough emphasis on drawing something for your step. Daniel E. suggested that maybe something like opposed rolls might help, something that allowed the giant to do damage or become more dangerous as the plan progressed. I dunno.<br/><br/>I was the final giant player, and after one of the players critiqued a detail I added (unfairly, I felt) I had a pretty strong emotional and defensive reaction, though I didn't say anything. I did call for a break though, and realized that it was probably tiredness that was provoking my feelings (it was a pretty mild critique, all told), and decided to drop out of the game-playing from there on, focusing on the less vulnerable effort of facilitating the games. From this point on I just explained the rules, moderated, ran timers, etc. Mark was falling asleep by this point too, so he moved over to the couch and drowsed off.<br/><br/>The next game was <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/146106/#Comment_146106" rel="nofollow">Boredom</a>, by Lasse Lundin. This also proved to be a huge hit. The mechanically enforced pauses do a really great job of simulating/generating boredom. It proved really difficult for the group to observe them. They would try to jump in with their objections to the proposed suggestions immediately, or try to relieve the boredom by laughing, commenting on the game, counting down the timers. Eventually two of them decided to die, and the last two agreed on a suggestion of just going to take naps a few seconds after the timer ran out.<br/><br/>Eighth up was <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/downloads/index.php?file=/free_games/hot_lamp.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Hot Lamp</a> by Jason Morningstar. The characters the group came up with were fantastic and hilarious. Quite a few very nice little character moments. And the semi-larpy bits of it proved to be a lot of fun. But the complicated interplay of the principle of agreement led to a situation that didn't make a ton of sense (everyone was a little tired, drunk, or both at this point). Also, the players didn't track the focus on communicating their responsibility, that is, the suspects spent time considering why their character couldn't go to jail, but they didn't spend a lot of time conveying that information to the other players clearly. Same for establishing the details of the crime. <br/><br/>The story that ultimately emerged was an interesting one: a first-generation college kid from a poor and disreputable family became friends with an ambitious criminal operator  he met in some class, The operator, looking for new employees, managed to connect with his sister (a poor mother of six), who in turn recruited the college kid into the operation. When the two of them got caught, the sister insisted on trying to pin everything on the operator, but the scared college kid sold her out and her kids got sent to the foster system. The "bad cop" wanted to help her and wanted to get to the bottom of things. Despite his aggressive front, he gradually becoming more sympathetic. Meanwhile the "good cop" maintained a relentless focus on the convictions that he could secure, and set up the deal to put her away. That was all interesting, but a lot of it only became clear in post-play conversation and debrief.<br/><br/>I'd like to try this again when people are a little more alert/on point. Lacey, who enjoyed the game but found it mildly frustrating, related a great story from her school days that she says almost put her off RPGs for good: Her teacher had her class do a mock trial based on the crime from Edgar Allan Poe's Tell-Tale Heart. She was the defense lawyer (or the defendant? Not sure. Either way, as established, it seemed pretty impossible since the main character confesses...). Anyway, she did all this preparation, working strictly from the details provided in the short story. The day of the trial, the prosecuting attorney shows up with a pile of evidence they had completely made up. Most significantly, they'd used desktop publishing software to print out a murder weapon! They'd mocked up a bloody knife and submitted it into evidence. She felt completely blindsided, nobody found a knife in the Tell-Tale Heart. How could she defend against that? Anyway, it amused me and got me thinking. I do think commitment to "yes, and" and clear communication of expectations can alleviate that "we're playing different games by different rules" feeling, but it's something to consider.<br/><br/>The ninth game was <a href="http://groundhoggth.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/tech-support.html" rel="nofollow">Tech Support</a> by James Mullen. We essentially played this game twice, each pair of the remaining players going once. The first story was fairly straightforward and silly, about a woman who bought a steak knife to make alterations to her shoes. Lacey and Daniel E. killed it with their spot-on portrayals. Then Daniel T. and Ronny told a story that started fantastical and ended up super-depressing, as Ronny's caller asked why drinking from the Fountain of Your Greatest Destiny didn't seem to make his life any better, and together they discovered that his Greatest Destiny was just brutal and depressing loneliness. It was heart-breaking and fantastic. Tech Support is great at setting up exactly what the character's options are and allowing those options to produce functional and surprising stories. One of the most well-designed games in the bunch, in my opinion.<br/><br/>(concluded below...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445827/#Comment_445827" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-28T19:28:05+00:00" title="June 28, 2015  7:28PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Final game of the evening, and my personal favorite despite not actually playing: <a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2008/04/09/three-poems/" rel="nofollow">A Trip Through Time as Seen Through the Eyes of a Fir Tree</a> by Lasse Lundin. The tower of dice never collapsed, but the stories our trees told were beautiful. Daniel T. was the oldest tree in the forest, and he told stories about the sheer joy of witnessing life and gentle physical pleasures. His amusement watching the migration of the salmon upstream and the families of bears chasing them down, the pride in housing nests of newborn birds, the physical relief of shedding his cones each year. His final narration was angry and frustrated, though, as a hunter shot a squirrel that lodged in his branches, and couldn't even be bothered to retrieve it. Daniel E.'s tree lived more on the edge of the forest, and expressed anger about the destruction of his neighbors for the winter celebrations of the humans, but eventually focused his anger to build an indomitable will to live, and finally came to peace and a sense of resignation about the cycle of life. Lacey told the story of a sapling, struggling to understand the point of her stationary life, but taking strength from the elder's stories, and eventually coming to appreciate the beauty and the sadness that she was allowed to witness. Ronald's tree, meanwhile, became more frustrated and angry about all the things he couldn't see and the things he couldn't control, the things glimpsed and heard but never understood. He took more and more to sleeping and ignoring the world and the trees around him. He ended the whole story by narrating himself waking up for a moment to see a young couple on a picnic, who carved their initials and a heart into him before he fell back to sleep. <br/><br/>It was a profoundly gentle and moving experience. At least for me as a facilitator and audience.<br/><br/>The whole night was a lot of fun, and I'd recommend trying the challenge to anyone (I would suggest getting started earlier than we did, tho). There are so many great RP poems out there. So many more I'd like to play, though there isn't one of these games I wouldn't play again, save maybe Going Galt. I'd want to tweak A Perfect Caper and When the Giant Comes, too. Different players expressed different favorites, but Mask, The Believers, Boredom, and Tech Support were all among the biggest hits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445828/#Comment_445828" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-28T19:30:16+00:00" title="June 28, 2015  7:30PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's great to see all these Game Poems getting an airing in some actual play; I hardly get the time to play mine, what little face-to-face gaming I can schedule right now tends to be taken up by longer games, so thank you for giving these a little time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445843/#Comment_445843" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-29T13:43:16+00:00" title="June 29, 2015  1:43PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds wonderful and exhausting!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445861/#Comment_445861" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-01T06:41:03+00:00" title="July  1, 2015  6:41AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing!
