We read through the PC vs. PC conflicts section, and it raised some questions.<br/><br/>1) There doesn't appear to be a way to turn on another PC and attack him during an encounter with the aliens. The text treats a PC vs. PC conflict like other encounters, starting with dominance and moving on from there. Nesting one encounter within another doesn't seem to be supported by the text, so we decided the troopers had to wait until the aliens were dealt with before fragging the Captian. Is that right?<br/><br/>2) The summary of PC vs. PC conflicts (pages 45 and 46) indicates that Strengths and Weaknesses can be used as normal to win or lose a PC vs. PC conflict. Does this mean that a PC can use a Strength to out-and-out kill another PC? Presumably the target PC could use a Weakness (if they have one) to potentially save themselves and end up only seriously wounded or something. But could that Weakness also be used to "lose on your terms" and declare that you manage to kill the attacking PC, too, before you die? <br/><br/>3) What if a PC is attacked by a couple other PCs - could he use a Strength and declare that he kills both of his attackers? <br/><br/>4) In PC vs. NPC conflicts, can a PC similarly use a Strength to kill the NPC? Could this method be used to off the Brigadier? Speaking of which, the text states that field promotion is the only way to get the Brigadier rank, so do you have to be a Colonel to get the promotion, or can a lower-ranked PC skip up to Brigadier just as other field promotions allow you to skip ranks?<br/><br/>We decided to allow the use of a Strength to kill the Captain (who did not have an available Weakness). We'd be very interested in how you handle these issues.<br/><br/>Thanks for putting together a great game.

You say... "This round. Fukc the aliens, I'm stabbing the Captain." and if you succeed you're going to cause a Kill (note... a single "Kill" not an outright "Dead") on him but you are not removing any Threat Tokens or otherwise opposing the aliens. Of course, he might decide on hearing your intended action that he wants to change what he's doing this turn. All fair and above board. You go around and decide what you're try to do then roll.<br/><br/>I had someone try this wrongly/sneakily in a game I ran, and you have to watch out for it. They say... oh, I'm using FA implying they're killing the aliens, then wait for the Captain to go before backstabbing him. It's bullshit (I made his knife light up with "FRIEND FRIEND FRIEND" as he stabbed and "FOE FOE FOE" when he plunged it into wood). If the target character in that case had known that the sneak was trying to stab him then he could have cancelled on his higher roll. So make sure they say up front what their trying before they roll.\n<blockquote>2) The summary of PC vs. PC conflicts (pages 45 and 46) indicates that Strengths and Weaknesses can be used as normal to win or lose a PC vs. PC conflict. Does this mean that a PC can use a Strength to out-and-out kill another PC? Presumably the target PC could use a Weakness (if they have one) to potentially save themselves and end up only seriously wounded or something.</blockquote>\nYes, they can kill another PC using a Strength -- if the Strength's single kill causes the PC(s) to be "Dead" then they're Dead. Otherwise it causes a single Kill -- might Mess or Cripple, say -- and then the encounter ends where they heal. But you won, got what you wanted too, just you can't straight take someone straight down from Fully Healthy to Dead, right? This is why Weaknesses are so useful, as they can save your ass in that situation. Strengths can't as you can't respond to a Strength with a Strength.\n<blockquote>But could that Weakness also be used to "lose on your terms" and declare that you manage to kill the attacking PC, too, before you die?</blockquote>\nHow, in any way, is that a loss. You're getting what you want, right? Your opponent dead as he attacks you is not a loss. \n<blockquote>3) What if a PC is attacked by a couple other PCs - could he use a Strength and declare that he kills both of his attackers?</blockquote>\nIf you have an attack that can cause kills to multiple targets (hey, suddenly upgrading Hand-to-Hand from 1 is desirable!) then you can do so. Just it's one kill as before, so you might make some really Dead and others only a Mess or Crippled (and pissed off!).\n<blockquote>4) In PC vs. NPC conflicts, can a PC similarly use a Strength to kill the NPC?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely, and NPCs have fewer "Health" boxes than PCs too...\n<blockquote>Could this method be used to off the Brigadier? Speaking of which, the text states that field promotion is the only way to get the Brigadier rank, so do you have to be a Colonel to get the promotion, or can a lower-ranked PC skip up to Brigadier just as other field promotions allow you to skip ranks?</blockquote>\nI carefully wrote The Brigadier and who the inner circle meeting with the Brigadier was -- The Colonels. My take is you have to be a Colonel yourself to step up, otherwise the GM can happily make an NPC Colonel the new Brigadier. Once you have a PC Brigadier, well that opens up Field Promotion to anyone who's a PC... I have never seen a PC Brigadier. Ever.\n<blockquote>We decided to allow the use of a Strength to kill the Captain (who did not have an available Weakness). We'd be very interested in how you handle these issues.</blockquote>\nThat sounds fine -- though the player may feel stiffed if you straight aced him to Dead. I saw someone kill his opponent by allowing the alien attack to cause a Kill, followed by his own TPK bomb... then a Strength. Ouch.<br/><br/>Learn to love your Weaknesses and hold on to one at all times. It stops you getting stiffed like this... it's why I always grab a Weakness before a Strength when levelling up... of course, it just opens the door for Force Weakness and Induce Weakness but such is life in the 3:16...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179676/#Comment_179676" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T11:00:03+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 11:00AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor,<br/><br/>Thanks for the replies. It seemed to make good sense to just be able to attack another PC during a conflict with the aliens, so I'm glad to hear that you intended it do be so.<br/><br/>My other questions were imprecise - I was referring to making a PC or NPC Dead rather than just inflicting a single Kill. So we did have the PC Captain end up Dead after a PC trooper used a Strength on him. We'll be sure to apologize next session for not giving him the full opportunity to fight for his life ; )<br/><br/>So a target PC use their Armour to absorb the Kill caused by Strength, right?<br/><br/>If the aliens are in a conflict, too, when PCs go after each other, does the PC have to choose whether to use their Strength to give a Kill to the target PC or to wipe out the aliens? If they've got an E-Cannon can they do both?<br/><br/>The text indicates that a player wins the conflict when they use a Strength (and also removes all alien threat tokens, which wouldn't apply in a PC vs. PC conflict). While your explanation makes good sense and prevents the instant-Dead that happened in our game, I don't see a way to get to your result from simply reading the current text. Winning the conflict strongly implies making the target PC Dead, not just wounding them. I'd suggest adding these issues to your FAQ and considering revision of the PC vs. PC conflicts section to spell out the different effect of Strengths when used against someone other than the aliens. <br/><br/>Your explanation of the Brigadier issues is great. We'll keep him out of sight until someone makes Colonel. Then, though, all bets are off.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179690/#Comment_179690" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T11:53:58+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 11:53AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cheers Eric<br/><br/>I think it's more dramatic if you don't just kill a PC outright from Healthy with a Strength (especially if the character using the Strength is A Mess or Crippled). It would sure stick in my craw if it were my PC, you know? A Mess and Crippled before Dead are there to pace your demise. But if the group totally buys into a Strength being a clean take-out in PC vs PC conflicts then that's going to be re-inforced by the group. I'm dubious over whether anyone I play with would buy that, though.<br/><br/>Oh, NPCs typically have one "Kill" box, with Officers having two, so that they last beyond a single roll or victory for their opponent. It's to pace their opposition. So for normal NPCs you could kill 'em straight out with a Strength. For Officers I think it's only fair that you soften them up first...<br/><br/>Armour: If someone used a Strength to cause you a Kill in such a way that Armour would make sense, then maybe you could use it. It would use your Armour up for that planet and maybe the guy using the Strength would be happy with that. The point is that the person using the Strength won the conflict at hand on their terms. Do they allow you to use Armour?<br/><br/>If your PC is fighting in an encounter then you should be clear before you roll the dice who you are fighting. That affects the decision making of people with better (or worse) rolls. Since they might use up a Flashback or Cancel or go ahead and succeed at what they had planned.<br/><br/>Ta,<br/>Gregor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179713/#Comment_179713" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T16:26:41+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  4:26PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a similar situation come up in our game.

Otherwise, the <i>conflict</i> is not won on anyone's terms - causing one kill is not a win, and the conflict will probably continue (thus it would not be an end to the conflict).<br/><br/>I honestly prefer to be taken out by a Strength entirely, rather than getting one Hit.

Lx has succinctly restated my own position, but Eric makes a very strong case as well. I felt like the decision came down to a pretty basic philosophical design question: are characters so precious that they must be granted exceptional protection (IMO delivering a single kill via Strength, when a Strength can clean out an entire ENCOUNTER, is exceptional), or are Strengths so precious that they must be carefully preserved for high-drama moments (i.e. choosing between the power to clear out an encounter or kill another character)?<br/><br/>If 1 Strength = 1 human kill, I can't imagine anyone ever using it, ever, for that reason. Why not just keep shooting/shouting at the other guy 'til he's down? Just to avoid rolling?<br/><br/>In any case, for a game where it seem abundantly clear the point is to promote eventual character-v-character conflict, the rules for doing so are unacceptably vague as written.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179979/#Comment_179979" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T03:56:49+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  3:56AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look, your group is completely happy with how you played it out.

Alexander is happy as a clam that someone used a Strength to kill his character and I don't have any problem with that at all.<br/><br/>For the people I play with they would be pointing at the Replacements page asking that they get all their Health boxes and so on to keep them alive before they accepted they were killed. I personally prefer to have a struggle and a character being placed in peril before being taken out, rather than just the first person to shout that they are using a Strength and killing off someone else's character.<br/><br/>A Strength on its own cannot kill an entire planet of Threat Tokens, it removes the Threat Tokens in a single encounter. A Strength resolves the conflict at hand -- a battle not the war.

My take on it, personally, is shit happens. Something happened in both your game and mine that Gregor didn't account for in the text. He probably should have, but he didn't. I'm going on the assumption that the omission is accidental, though that may not be the case. <br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, a discussion of this possibility as a dial, in the text, that can and should be set by the individual groups would help avoid issues in the future. Can we agree on this? It's more a failure in the text than the design.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don't really get is the vitriol. Why are we getting this bent out of shape? I flipped through the rules, didn't find anything to clarify the question. I hmm'd over it for a moment, then saw the words "Don't be afraid to kill the player characters" (or something along those lines; I don't have the book available at this moment) and made a judgment call. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turns out, my judgment call happens to have been the same as your group's, and different than Gregor's. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, sure.. We're all about the design matters concept. We expect that our indie games are complete, without gaping holes in them needing to be filled with house rules, which traditional gamers expect. But seriously, it's one hole in an otherwise very tight design. It may be that the tightness is what makes this hole seem bigger than it is, but it's a 1-in-3 chance that anyone gets tangled in it. Fight it out, and you never have to worry about it. Don't get into PvP, and you never have to worry about it. Only if you want to use an all-powerful Strength in PvP does it raise it's ugly head. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I'm just too trad. I expect to make judgment calls without getting mad at the design.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I'm the guy who got agitated at purposeful design choices in Burning Wheel, so maybe I'm not one to talk.<br/>\n<br/>\n(edited for clarity)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180057/#Comment_180057" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T12:01:34+00:00" title="November 24, 2008 12:01PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it's this bit from the FAQ that's deepest in my craw:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton in the 3:16 FAQ</cite>I am not changing any of the text in the book. I think that when you look at the rule wordings in the book in the context of where you are in play and what is happening in the fiction/at the table they are actually clear. When you play out an encounter following the steps in the book you'll find them guiding you through it. The exact wording of the present rules was something I worked pretty hard at and got a lot of feedback on.</blockquote>\nThere's not just one hole, and this issue is not the first hole. There are several, but the gushing reviews and "shun the disbeliever!" nonsense is so loud that, frankly, I feel like we need to shout to be heard.

I've been down that road with other games, and when it's clear that that discussion is part of the exercise, it's easy enough to play along.<br/><br/>If I really unpack it, the sequence of events goes something like this:<br/><br/>1) We try 3:16 and have a pretty good time with it. Some rules questions come up in play, as they always do in every early play of every game.<br/><br/>2) I post those questions. The reply I get back is either a directive to RTFM or frothing from overenthusiastic fans.<br/><br/>3) Questions answered, we play again. This time we understand that most procedural issues are, in fact, addressed one way or another, but they may not be clearly linked in the text. We're willing to extrapolate functional answers from our growing understanding of your design intent.<br/><br/>4) Your FAQ goes up, and you've firmly planted your flag in the sand that working "pretty hard" on your text and getting feedback prior to publishing means there's no need to consider revision or clarification. Having worked full-time in this business for a decade (about a decade ago), my eyes can't roll up <i>far enough</i> at this statement. <br/><br/>5) In response to your FAQ position, I post a question in which I identify a clearly broken -- not unclear, outright broken -- bit of language in the text. Again I get the RTFM and fanboy dogpile. Eventually, someone other than me agrees on my point. Only then is my issue taken seriously. It's your outright <i>resistance</i> to receiving input that's getting to me at this point.<br/><br/>6) We play some more, and now I'm wondering if we've played deeper into your game than anyone else has since none of the published APs seem to address high-officer hijinx. That's fine, but now we have to trust you've provided a workable means of getting where the game is supposed to take us.<br/><br/>7) Finally we have a session where your signature mechanic (flashbacks) bumps up against the behavior you've clearly aimed to produce (character vs. character conflict). This, to me, doesn't strike me as an unusual or wacky edge case -- from my perspective, <i>every</i> game of 3:16 will eventually produce this moment of play! But the rules say nothing on how to resolve that procedure. We have some differences of opinion at the table, so we decide to post more questions. This, despite being told to RTFM twice, and being dogpiled twice. I'm more than a little reluctant to deal with that bullshit again, so Eric agrees to post up.<br/><br/>8) The answer you produce can in no way be extrapolated from the text provided. It's <i>new material</i>. You've had to produce new material to explain your intent behind what seems like an inevitable event in your game. <br/><br/>And that flag of yours is still, as of the last post, firmly planted. What I'm hearing is, "I'm happy with the text as it stands, even though the text does not provide guidance on perhaps the most important event in the game."<br/><br/>Am I mad? Not really. Disappointed. The longer I spend thinking about this, the more I think there's a fundamental cultural problem at work in the indie scene. That's probably worth a separate thread, but I don't look forward to the dogpile that will ensue.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180238/#Comment_180238" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T09:13:18+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  9:13AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The roots to my reaction are from this thread, which is my first experience with the game being discussed on the forum. (With my medical complications I've not been as active online as I'd like to be). <br/><br/>But the laconic, lackadaisical comment: "...your group is completely happy with how it played out. So what is the problem?" seemed (to me) to completely ignore and discount all the social dynamics that went into making the choice (which to me is a large part of how it played out), and focused instead on the in-game fiction and the final rules choice (which to me is a small part of how it played out).<br/><br/>And since a game text is supposed to minimize, if not eliminate, play confusion and rules disputes (especially of a kind that is likely to come up in play - pvp using a strength), well, I'm frustrated with the lack of clarity in the text (and furthermore shocked that you're unwilling to change the text). <br/><br/>A part of my frustrations at this point is motivated by my own choice to reconsider the text for my game, where I decided to go through all the threads and questions about the game and figure out how best to address said things in the text. I can't see why a game designer would not do that, I can't see how a designer could be happy with rules text that causes this much confusion. It confuses me. <br/><br/>(I'm also confused at your rules interpretation. Yes, a Strength wipes out every threat token in an encounter, threat tokens which normally are taken out by hits, one at a time. Similarly, characters have hit boxes, which are taken out by hits, one at a time. So it seems fitting that the threat tokens of an encounter are the hit boxes of that encounter, and a Strength takes out [i]all of them[/i] and the encounter ended. Similarly, using a Strength against a character, which has its own hit boxes, it seems to follow [i]all of them[/i] should be removed as well, otherwise the encounter is not ended - and will continue - after the use of a Strength. It's difficult for me, at least, to see your interpretation justified using the text as it reads.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180290/#Comment_180290" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T12:59:19+00:00" title="November 25, 2008 12:59PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.<br/><br/>If your group spends an hour debating a rule, I'm not sure the problem lies with the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180291/#Comment_180291" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T13:02:03+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  1:02PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

Call it the Libra in me or whatever. After about 10 minutes I had offered up a temporary solution, but there was clearly more to be discussed at the table so I let it go. We can be pretty eggheaded about design talk, so the time involved wasn't unusual. Emotions ran a little high, but my take on that was it was more exasperation than, you know, seething nerdrage.<br/><br/>And was it really an "hour"? I don't know; the time didn't really bother me much because I thought both Eric and Lx had strong arguments, neither of which had any formal basis in the rules text. So a lot of that hour was taken up teasing out the intent of the game. In the end, we really couldn't decide if the game's intent was to make characters disposable, or only to <i>talk as if</i> characters are disposable, while providing mechanical support for a play style where characters are by no means disposable.<br/><br/>Whichever way is fine, and I'm sure all my players would agree. The "the rules are an inkblot" approach was amusing in Lacuna. All the yapping about how tight and smooth 3:16 is, however, didn't really set us up for dealing with such a big gap.<br/><br/>I think it's Ralph who says a guideline of good design is that the players are never left wondering how to resolve what happens next at the table. Or something like that. I'm almost certainly misquoting him but I think that's the gist. That's where we are with the text of 3:16. If it were an edge case, well, it'd be an unfortunate oversight but easily remedied. If it were about something utterly insubstantial -- are MB suits camo or brightly colored? -- y'all could happily ban me for being stoopid. <br/><br/>It's not those things. As a result, I'm dumbfounded that the situation didn't come up in playtest. Now I'm wondering what else didn't come up in playtest.<br/><br/>At this point, a simple entry into the FAQ along the lines of "A Strength can be used to inflict a single Kill on a PC or NPC" would be absolutely and totally fine. It might open some other, also interesting, conversations (i.e. why is inflicting a character Kill considered "resolving an encounter"?) but then it'd be just ruminating and noodling.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180314/#Comment_180314" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T14:26:23+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  2:26PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also should point out that there was no between-player animosity in our argument/debate.

That's disappointing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have to say I'm rather sympathetic to the notion of spending an hour hashing out the rule and trying to parse the designer's intent.  I seem to remember a group doing that with Poison'd once upon a time with much less satisfactory results than you achieved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've not had this issue arise in my games, but the logic Alexander lays out above is exactly the sort of logic I would have used to try and resolve it.  So FWIW I would have ruled differently than Gregor as well, though I probably would have found it more unsatisfying a solution than you guys did and so am also sympathetic towards Gregor's interpretation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll also say, however, that the point has been well and truly made and further hammering on it likely crosses the line from valuable feedback to petulance...and I say that from experience with full awareness of all Pot and Kettle issues thereof.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
