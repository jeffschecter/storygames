Will do.<br><br><i>Blood Red Sands</i> is Ralph Mazza's newest game.  He knocked out the alpha as he was taking a mental break from <i>Robots and Rapiers</i>.  Ironically, <i>Blood Red Sands</i> will be done before <i>Robots and Rapiers</i>.  Do not despair, those of you waiting for R&amp;R!  It will be coming out.<br><br>But now to <i>Blood Red Sands</i>.<br><br>Each player has a Hero in a swords and sorcery world ruled by the Five Witch Kings of Abalone.  Gameplay is divided into ordeals.  During an ordeal, one player will play his Hero, and the rest of the players will construct Factions who are each pursuing goals of their own.  The idea is that the Hero enters an existing situation, figures out what is going on, chooses sides, and proceeds to kick serious butt.  Of course, the various Factions try to get the Hero to align with their goals, trying to earn Victory Points by achieving their Goal and inflicting damage on the other factions.<br><br>Over the course of several ordeals, the weaker Heroes will begin to retire from the game, until only one is left.  The player of this Hero will then enter the final ordeal, which is against one of the five Witch Kings.  Whichever player earned the most VPs will get the Witch King faction.  The other players are then assigned the other factions in the ordeal.  The epic struggle commences until either the Hero or Witch King emerges victorious.  This player is declared to be the winner of the game.<br><br>The system is a weird conglomeration of <i>Dirty Secrets</i>, <i>Polaris</i>, <i>Universalis</i>, and <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>.  Essentially, a player holds the role of Chronicler, telling the story of the Hero and his ordeal.  He continues to narrate until he says something that is intolerable to one of the other players.  He may address this in one of two ways:<br/><br/>1) He may Challenge the Chronicler's narration.  He does this by rising to his feet and Challenging the narration.  Unless another player rises to defend the narration, the Chronicler must yield by saying, "As you will" and changing his narration.<br/><br/>2)  He may invoke conflict.  He does this by slamming his hand on the table and saying something like, "It shall not be."  Then the game goes to dice.<br/><br/>The dice system is based on the Dogs system with a couple of twists.  First, dice used to Raise and See aren't lost, unless the player Took the Blow.  Rather, they accumulate in a Used pool and can be returned to play by damaging one die.  Second, certain dice are given colors, which indicate special abilities.  For example, Red means Force and inflicts extra damage.  So, conflict has something of a CCG feel, where you're using dice combos to overmaneuver your opponent.<br/><br/>We're still working our way through an alpha playtest, but I have a good feeling about the game.  It's uber-macho, which works for me, and it's a ridiculous amount of fun.<br/><br/>I feel like I essentially yammered in your direction for a while.  Got any particular questions that I can answer?<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118383/#Comment_118383" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T19:19:31+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  7:19PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ye gods, it's full of stars...<br/>\n<br/>\nEr, no, that's fine.

Fallout is replaced with Damage, which is caused the same way (having to block with more than 2 dice) but which is resolved by rolling the damaged dice.  Even dice are lost only for that conflict, odd dice are lost for the whole ordeal.  In addition, while most of your dice are "white" some are "colored" which have special rules.  There's a play mat to sort dice for those who don't have enough dice of the actual colors.<br/>\n<br/>\nRed Dice - Force and aggression:  Attack and Defend (raise and see) normally, then regardless of the result damage one additional opponent's die (even if on the defense)<br/>\nYellow Dice - Finesse and style:  Attack and Defend normally, then recover any of the dice used so you can use it again.<br/>\nGreen Dice - Deception and Cunning:  Attack normally, then after seeing what your opponent did swap out the die for a different die, or reroll a die on defense<br/>\nBlue Dice - Attack and Defend normally, cancel one of your opponent's colored dice of your choice, except purple sorcery dice<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are Purple Sorcery Dice,  Sorcery in the game is all powered by souls.  Drain the soul from your victims and use it to power your spells.  The truly powerful tap into the very "soul" of the world, turning the world into barren wasteland.  Each flavor of sorcery has slightly different special rules, but the color effects are all narration.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoul Stealing Sorcery steals your opponents dice and adds them to your own.<br/>\nTormentor Runic sorcery (Tormentors torture their victims until they achieve the ultimate torment, they then brand or tatoo a rune in the shape of their victims contorted body onto themselves to steal their power), you can play the runic die as a third die in an attack or defense without it counting as a third die.<br/>\nSoul Forging (Forging artifacts by hammering the souls of your victims into items of metal) automatically damages all opposing dice of lesser value on attack or defense<br/>\nTotem Magic (stealing the souls of animals and beasts and binding them into a totem for their power) Can reroll the dice to get a better roll and each totem has 2 of the regular color abilities<br/>\nBlessed (the only "good" magic, the discipline taught by the goddess of good who taught man all of the arts and crafts...until the Witch Kings slew her and used her soul to kill the rest of the gods) Cancels all colors, including sorcery, and if the opponent has sorcery dice is automatically set to its maximum value instead of being rolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hero is created like a PC, the Faction Players all get a bunch of Resource Points to spend to create stuff during play similarly to Universalis Components.  If you inflict long term damage on another player you win more Resource Points.  Faction Players also gain a Victory Point towards seeing who will play the Witch King in the final ordeal.  Hero players instead gain a Legend Point towards the end of the Ordeal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ordeal (scenario) ends whenever the Hero Player says it does, but the quality of the Epilogue depends on how many Legend Points the hero earned.  The hero then gains 1 Legend Die equal in size to half the points.  The hero player cannot end the ordeal until they have at least 8 points (a d4) but if they do, the epilogue is essentially a total tragedy, the hero's presence made it worse.  d6 (12 points) is a total tragedy except 1 good thing.  d8 (16 points) is mostly good except 1 bad thing.  d10 is all good.  There is also a d12 (24 points and the only way to get a d12 in the game) but the hero must have made a vow and kept it during play.<br/>\n<br/>\nA vow is the only way for the hero to get lost dice back.  Make a vow, regain your lost dice, but if you fail to keep it you gain Doom. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we've been playtesting it pretty heavily for a couple of months now, and its working very well.  I think it will be ready for outside playtest soon, maybe this coming weekend.  If you want to try it out, shoot me your email and I'll send you the latest version.  I was planning on bringing it to Dreamation, but work's gotten crazy the last couple of months, and I'm not sure now whether I'll make it there.<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118404/#Comment_118404" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T22:02:04+00:00" title="January  7, 2008 10:02PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!<br/><br/>(Ralph, I often forget that human beings created Universalis, and that it didn't always exist as the Ur game.

Drain the soul from your victims and use it to power your spells.  The truly powerful tap into the very "soul" of the world, turning the world into barren wasteland.  Each flavor of sorcery has slightly different special rules, but the color effects are all narration.<br/><br/>Soul Stealing Sorcery steals your opponents dice and adds them to your own.<br/>Tormentor Runic sorcery (Tormentors torture their victims until they achieve the ultimate torment, they then brand or tattoo a rune in the shape of their victims contorted body onto themselves to steal their power), you can play the runic die as a third die in an attack or defense without it counting as a third die.<br/>Soul Forging (Forging artifacts by hammering the souls of your victims into items of metal) automatically damages all opposing dice of lesser value on attack or defense<br/>Totem Magic (stealing the souls of animals and beasts and binding them into a totem for their power) Can reroll the dice to get a better roll and each totem has 2 of the regular color abilities<br/>Blessed (the only "good" magic, the discipline taught by the goddess of good who taught man all of the arts and crafts...until the Witch Kings slew her and used her soul to kill the rest of the gods) Cancels all colors, including sorcery, and if the opponent has sorcery dice is automatically set to its maximum value instead of being rolled.<br/><br/>The Hero is created like a PC, the Faction Players all get a bunch of Resource Points to spend to create stuff during play similarly to Universalis Components.  If you inflict long term damage on another player you win more Resource Points.  Faction Players also gain a Victory Point towards seeing who will play the Witch King in the final ordeal.  Hero players instead gain a Legend Point towards the end of the Ordeal.<br/><br/>The ordeal (scenario) ends whenever the Hero Player says it does, but the quality of the Epilogue depends on how many Legend Points the hero earned.  The hero then gains 1 Legend Die equal in size to half the points.  The hero player cannot end the ordeal until they have at least 8 points (a d4) but if they do, the epilogue is essentially a total tragedy, the hero's presence made it worse.  d6 (12 points) is a total tragedy except 1 good thing.  d8 (16 points) is mostly good except 1 bad thing.  d10 is all good.  There is also a d12 (24 points and the only way to get a d12 in the game) but the hero must have made a vow and kept it during play.<br/><br/>A vow is the only way for the hero to get lost dice back.  Make a vow, regain your lost dice, but if you fail to keep it you gain Doom.<br/>Ralph</blockquote>\nThis sounds awesome. To me, just from reading the text, you've brought strategy and resource management back to story-games in a way that won't make strategy-shy people (like myself) risk head-explody. I like how different types of magic have distinct effects. <br/><br/>By the way: PCs get magic, right? And inevitably PCs must fight other PCs for the chance to take out the Witch-Kings, is that right? Or are they fighting each other through Heroes and Factions the whole time? I got confused.  <br/><br/>And I'd love to playtest it, but I have no groups available who would be interested. And suddenly that makes me feel bad...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118889/#Comment_118889" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T19:24:41+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  7:24PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PCs can indeed get magic.  Balancing the purple dice is currently one of the things that we're looking at.  They can be brutal!<br/><br/>Heroes never fight.  Instead, at certain times in between ordeals, you check to see if one of the Heroes retires.  I don't remember the exact procedure off-hand, but it's tied to having the lowest Legend score.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118897/#Comment_118897" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T21:18:20+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  9:18PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the better you do as a hero during your Ordeal (i.e. the more damage you inflict on the other players' factions) the higher Legend you earn.  After each player has had a chance to play at least 1 Ordeal as the hero, all remaining heroes dice off with their Legend Dice.  The low rolling hero gets retired...they had their moment and a tale or two was told about them, but then they fade into the mists of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefor when you are playing a faction when its someone elses turn as hero, you are motivated to make sure the hero doesn't do well...so they don't accumulate more Legend Dice than your hero.  On the other hand, when you play a Faction you gain victory points when you do well, and when you achieve your faction goals...you also want the other faction players to do poorly so they don't get as many victory points as you...and the hero is a huge mass of effectiveness that you can use to help bludgeon the other factions if you can get them to work with you.  And while the hero is pretty powerful, he isn't powerful enough to take on all the other factions (the exact ratio is currently being balanced)...so the hero player needs to ally with a Faction to survive long enough to earn Legend.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the part I think is pretty neat.  While the scenario provides some motivations and goals for the factions, and in setting terms certain factions are "bad guys" and others "good guys", there is a lot of meta game strategy in the sense of which other Faction Player is ahead in Victory Points, which hero is ahead in Legend Points and so on...so there are meta motivations layering on the scenario motivations that provide rationale for players to stab and betray or make strange bed fellows.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately the Hero with the best legend fights the Witch King and the player with the highest Victory Points plays the Witch King and everybody else plays to avoid being last...because if you come in last...then the next time you play, even if its with another group years later you have to take the "Vanquished" Trait and suffer the humiliation of having lost.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118991/#Comment_118991" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T12:01:43+00:00" title="January 10, 2008 12:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br/>Ultimately the Hero with the best legend fights the Witch King and the player with the highest Victory Points plays the Witch King and everybody else plays to avoid being last...because if you come in last...then the next time you play, even if its with another group years later you have to take the "Vanquished" Trait and suffer the humiliation of having lost.</blockquote>\nThat's a ballsy rule, and I love it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
