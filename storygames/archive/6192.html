I have been able to carry the gospel of GNS to many corners of the internet under the clever guise of generally disputing the details.<br/><br/>I am pleased to report that my recent masquerade as Chango Chi, notorious troll, has succesfully driven our arch-nemesis the RPGpundit to resign from his tenure at "enemy headquarters", theRPGsite, as posted today on his blog and on that site.<br/><br/>I will state my concern with the recent behaviour of agent Mearls.  I was under the impression that he was "deep cover", and was expected to act subversively.  However, over this last year, I have seen him openly spreading Narrativist techniques, without even the standard cover posture of "something I dug out of all that weirdness".  This vexes me.  I am vexed by this.<br/><br/>At present, I am undertaking a personal mission among the (turn, spit) traditionalist players of Dark Heresy, attempting to solve the minor rules problems of that game by introducing certain indie techniques to the common body of practice.  I believe that I can report significant success on this front.<br/><br/>The rogues, Donoghue and Hicks, continue to suspect nothing.<br/><br/>Forward the Revolution!<br/><br/>-Levi                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137456/#Comment_137456" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-01T11:30:30+00:00" title="April  1, 2008 11:30AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The collective thanks you for your hard work in bringing us this encouraging report, Brother Blow Torch of Immaculate Serenity.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl7mnP6mR_E" rel="nofollow">Forward the Revolution!</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137491/#Comment_137491" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-01T12:42:01+00:00" title="April  1, 2008 12:42PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9633" rel="nofollow">Only now, when it is too late do they realize how far our claws are into D&amp;D's so called 4th edition.</a><br/><br/>Once a new generation of gamers puts on their black leotards and talks about their feelings in order to kill some orcs - our mission, to destroy all fun wherever it might rest its head, will be complete.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
