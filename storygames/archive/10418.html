Not so much the actual word "beta", but the concept of beta testing software is reasonably well-known and, importantly to this particular discussion, provides the end user with a reasonable expectation of what he or she is getting.<br/><br/>Now, I've never produced an ashcan, but I've run a number of beta tests in my life. It's not exactly what you expect, so maybe some guidelines from beta testing might be of some use to those who actually do make ashcans. (If not, well, electrons are cheap).<br/><br/>First, what does "beta" even mean? There are many definitions, but two are fairly common. The "alhpa" stage of software is when all the features are written. This is "functionally complete". It may not have seen much testing, but every base you wanted to cover is covered. At this point, testing is still mostly internal. Some companies release alpha software, but not many. When all the<em>serious</em>problems you know of are handled, you release "beta". The expectation is that you may still need to change stuff, but the final result will at least recognizable what is in the beta.<br/><br/>In order of importance, the rules of thumb for beta testing are:<br/><br/><strong>One: Find Problems</strong>This sounds obvious, but is easy to forget in the middle of it all.<em>Everything</em>you do has to be filtered through the lens of "is this helping me discover flaws in my product". This is much harder than it sounds.<br/><br/><strong>Two: Triage</strong>Vet<em>every</em>problem you hear about, with the realization that many of of them<em>are not worth solving</em>. The quickest way to kill a beta is to treat everything as important. Many things will not be. Some things will be, but fixing them will do so much collateral damage that you are better off not bothering (for this version, at least). It's rare, but you may also run into a deal-breaker issue: a design flaw so jarring that you need to head back to the drawing board. (This is rare, but every time I've seen it happen was because of misunderstanding what the user's needs were.)<br/><br/><strong>Three: Keep Costs Down</strong>Don't print documentation if electronic will do. Don't burn CDs if downloading will do. Don't pay bribes unless you have to. Don't advertise unless you have no other choice. Don't spend time with people who aren't helping you if you could be spending it with people who are.<br/><br/><strong>Four: Control the Product</strong>The type of control here refers more to control of the product's destiny than its content; that is, managing the "intellectual property rights" and market share. How this is done will be<em>radically</em>different depending on the product and circumstances. For some products, this means super-secret betas with NDAs signed by everyone. For others it means massive public betas for maximum exposure. If there is an art to beta testing, figuring out the right mechanism for control of your product is it.<br/><br/><strong>Five: Finish</strong>The beta is useless if it never ends. A common mistake is to set a "finished condition" based on the problems found, such as "when all issues of Medium severity or higher are fixed". Done this way, either the beta will never end, or it will end only because issues are managed artificially to meet the condition by a certain time. Generally, a timed deadline works, and everything else doesn't. The goal isn't a perfect product; that doesn't exist. Instead the goal is to make the the product the best that you can make it in the time allotted. If you aren't proud of the result, no one else will be either; have the decency to kill it and move on to the next thing.<br/><br/>Of all of these, most of the techniques used in the software industry would work for RPGs. The big exception is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, as the mechanisms for controlling software different than those controlling RPGs. (You can, for example, make software expire, a trick not really tolerated in the PDF world.)<br/><br/>In any case, the point here is that when customers sign on to a beta (whether voluntarily or paying for the "privilege"), there is a clear indication of the quality they can expect and what they are in for. This thread suggests that (right or wrong) that same expectation isn't universally held regarding ashcans.<br/><hr/><br/><b>Posted By: David Artman:</b><br/>Thanks, Lester, for that very useful parallel. I tend to apply a SLIGHTLY different metric for Alpha/Beta:<br/>* ST - System Test; really only applicable to modular or generic/universal systems; ready to play, but no guidance (maybe this is the "tools" stage of a computer product?)<br/>* Alpha - Full system and playable content; in an RPG, that would mean all system components and enough of setting to get started.<br/>* Beta - Full system, full (mostly) content; just looking for the silly shit; in RPGs, this is typos, weird tweaks to rule combinations, maybe points-cost balances.<br/>* Gold Master - This Is What I'm Shipping--is it broke? (This would be a proof stage for a publication.)<br/><br/>I might be skewed some, though, because my system is a generic one, intended for LARP.

Based on that, I'd suggest that developing all the way to the end to a finished game is an important part of understanding what features need to exist in the engines and tools (and, by analogy, a generic game system). There are a lot of ideas that seem good on paper that run into problems when you try to put them into practice, and things that come up when you try to make real games that people didn't think of when designing the engines/tools. Real usability testing requires people to fully use the product the way the product was intended to be used. Some of the features of our engine/tools seemed really compelling when you just "played around" with them, but really didn't work when you went deeper and tried to fully employ them. (I'm being a bit abstract there, since I don't want to badmouth the company or the friends that still work there). I don't know if the analogy works exactly with what you're designing, but it seemed relevant to the topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231781/#Comment_231781" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T12:46:43+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:46PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Charlie Gilb</cite>One obvious difference I can think of is that when talking about RPG beta testing, any 'bugs' that you find in the system can be immediately hacked or skirted around by house-rulings, ignoring results, or ignoring rules entirely.

Good point.  How do you think releveant knowledge factors into both these fields? For example, do you think it's worthwhile to have people who have never played RPGs before do beta-testing? What about the same for people who are going to beta-test the newest first-person shooter? Do these two things have different prerequisites for experience, or should each game be judged on a case-by-case basis?<br/>\n<br/>\n((David, if you think those questions might de-rail this thread, just say so.))                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231785/#Comment_231785" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T12:54:41+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:54PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The alpha/beta playtesting thing has been discussed for a number of years, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9386#Item_29" rel="nofollow">my most recent attempt</a> was a few months ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231788/#Comment_231788" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T12:58:12+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:58PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, designers were referring to Alphas and Betas long before Ashcan got adopted.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me an Alpha is:  Ready to playtest with my own group.<br/>\nBeta is:  Ready for someone else to play test.<br/>\n<br/>\nA "pre Alpha" is:  Ready to playstorm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231789/#Comment_231789" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T12:59:15+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:59PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>Real usability testing requires people to fully use the product the way the product was intended to be used.</blockquote>See, I know that iterative process is how it's done with engine design for a particular interface and gameplay. But doesn't that basically just mean that, for a generic product, it has to get out as a System Test and be used in every way that users can imagine? I can easily build a high fantasy or post-apoc "game" using the core system... but I've already MADE the core and pretty much tried to consider every genre convention in the course of setting up its elements. I won't FIND "problems when [I] put them into practice" because I won't make false assumption or try to shoehorn a particular element into a role for which another element was really intended (nor will I try to support a style of play that the whole engine has no support for--no "building a platformer with a driving game engine").<br><br>So that's what drives me to release a System Test document, not to mention the VERY hard task of thoroughly testing something inherently "massive multiplayer" with an "in-house team" of a handful of LARP friends in town. And the need for that core system test drives straight to the acceptance that the core rules will always be free (but that's off topic, except for how free PDF system rule may or may not draw additional blind testers).<br><br>I would very much like to observe another group take the system and test it--external testers (or focus groups, maybe? A bit of both?). But if I guide them, it's no better than a developer looking over a testers shoulder and saying, "Well, you aren't supposed to equip that item yet because you need two hands free to wall-crawl." Better if I can just WATCH the tester equip the item then flagellate against the wall for ten minutes, wondering why wall crawl stopped working. (Ug, horrid example.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>I don't know if the analogy works exactly with what you're designing, but it seemed relevant to the topic.</blockquote>That's fine--the point of the thread, really, is to compare and contrast.

What about the same for people who are going to beta-test the newest first-person shooter? Do these two things have different prerequisites for experience, or should each game be judged on a case-by-case basis?</blockquote>\nTesting isn't free (whether you pay in money or just time and effort), so the kind and quantity of testing you do needs to be based on Return on Investment. I think it probably depends on the target market. FPSs, as hardcore games, can probably assume that the majority of their customers are coming into the game with a basic knowledge of how to play FPSs. A casual game, on the other hand, needs to be playable by anyone. I think there are some analogous factors in RPGs.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>See, I know that iterative process is how it's done with engine design for a particular interface and gameplay. But doesn't that basically just mean that, for a generic product, it has to get out as a System Test and be used in every way that users can imagine?<br/></blockquote>\nSort of. It depends on how much development happens on top of the generic system to produce a "game". I think it makes sense to go to all the way to the end at least once in a focused, controlled, observable manner before opening the floodgates. It may be that you've done that already, that's the danger of working with analogies and abstractions.\n<blockquote>I can easily build a high fantasy or post-apoc "game" using the core system... but I've already MADE the core and pretty much tried to consider every genre convention in the course of setting up its elements. I won't FIND "problems when [I] put them into practice" because I won't make false assumption or try to shoehorn a particular element into a role for which another element was really intended (nor will I try to support a style of play that the whole engine has no support for--no "building a platformer with a driving game engine").</blockquote>\nI think the danger I'm pointing out is the difference between "I tried that and it works" and "I thought about that and I'm pretty sure it will work". In theory, there's no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is. On some of the products I worked on there were plenty of legacy features that worked great in theory but that were a pain in the ass in practice. It may be that this is less of an issue for a lower-complexity product like an RPG.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>David, I don't mean to be unhelpful, but I'm wary of trying to map RPG development/lifecycle to software develop/lifecycle too closely. I just think they fundamentally work differently, on pretty much every level.<br/></blockquote>\nCould you talk a little bit about why you feel that way? I have worked in both software development and hardware development, and there were a lot of things that I learned in one that could be applied to the other. It isn't obvious what would make tabletop game development so different (especially since it can be compared to video game dev).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231886/#Comment_231886" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T17:07:35+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  5:07PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another data point: I'm with Tim.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232241/#Comment_232241" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T09:51:05+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  9:51AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2009 9:56AM by David Artman.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not a poll, but thanks for taking the time to tell us we're wasting time! :x                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232420/#Comment_232420" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T05:19:41+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  5:19AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2009 5:20AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty dumbfounded that people can't find points of comparison in David's post for games. We're not talking about software vs. rpgs. We're talking design process and production methods. A lot of the current fashionable software design processes were ported over from the automobile industry. If the software industry is smart enough to learn design processes from the automobile industry, I think we can find parallels here in our biz too.<br/><br/>I've had a lot of luck using things I've learned from software design in working on my game, specifically some video game design processes I've seen. Like John, I've been thinking of my game in terms of Alpha (internal playtesting) and Beta (external playtesting). And the five rules of Beta Testing are very much relevant. Triage is something I think about more and more, especially as feedback and suggestions about my game may be legitimate concerns but otherwise alter my vision of the game.<br/><br/>One developer who I think has an interesting method of design is Tarn Adams - the Dwarf Fortress guy. He starts with fiction, and then reverse engineers his game so that the fiction is something that could feasibly happen in his game. This is another thing I've adopted in my own, admittedly sparse, designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232426/#Comment_232426" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T06:37:21+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  6:37AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a professional software developer and (semi-professional) RPG publisher, I do think this is a useful analogy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne overlooked benefit of playtesting is that it can help you define your market - the subsets of people to whom the game appeals.

As mentioned above, it's easy to "patch" pre-release--send out new beta pubs--but how do you "unpatch" to make those possessing the beta buy? What's to prevent someone with a beta from "self-patching" the last nuanced changes for Gold Master/Final Release?<br/><br/>2) How do you manage "Revised" or "V2" release prep and delivery? Specifically, how do you prepare (and test) and market a Revised Edition without making the First Edition seem like a bait and switch (or a "sold beta")? Are there responsibilities to the buyers of the First Edition that must be met upon release of the Revised (if so, what; if not, why not)? Finally, is there a quantitative or qualitative line that is crossed where a Revised Edition actually becomes a Second Edition?<br/><br/>As should be obvious, I have moved to life cycle management issues; things we deal with from post-playtesting to post-new-edition. (I have ideas for dealing with both questions; I'll hold off until we see what others think.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232465/#Comment_232465" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T11:09:42+00:00" title="September 15, 2009 11:09AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does anyone know about how Paizo conducted the alpha and beta tests of Pathfinder, which was also the terminology they used for their pre-release versions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232485/#Comment_232485" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T12:41:31+00:00" title="September 15, 2009 12:41PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Step one in this format I think is highly connected to advise I've given often about playtesting and how the primariy purpose of it is to stress test your game to find where it breaks.  A process which may wind up being but is not designed to be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther's have disagreed, suggesting that they go into a playtest playing the game as if they were just sitting down to have fun with it...which I think violates the central tenet of "Everything you do has to be filtered through the lens of "is this helping me discover flaws in my product".  If you can enjoy play while rooting out flaws, that's a bonus.  But if you're enjoying play without really looking for or paying attention to flaws...or worse...subconciously auto-correcting for them...then you aren't playtesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the Patch UnPatch question, David...I think that's pretty much a non issue, at least at the scale most of us operate at.  As has been noted it can be incredibly difficult to even FIND playtesters at all...let alone those dedicated enough to be really really valuable.  It seems to me that the number of people who have been a) exposed to your Beta, b) into it enough to want to play the final version, and c) willing to reverse engineer the final solution themselves is so trivial as to have no significant impact on your revenue stream.  Quite the contrary...people that eager to play that they'd rather "hack the code" themselves vs. buy the final version are probably among your most enthusiastic early adopters and thus should be cultivated and encouraged rather than stopped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232487/#Comment_232487" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T13:05:57+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  1:05PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I went back to correct mistakes in Maid after publishing (the few rules mistakes and many grammar mistakes/clarifications), I adopted a methodology similar to OS release codes.<br><br>First number represents the edition.<br>Second number represents major updates, in my case updates that fixed formatting or rules-based mistakes.<br>Third number represents minor updates, in my case updates that fixed grammar or other minor stuff.<br><br/>So Maid 0.9 was the one we used to get printing estimates.

It *is* a minor issue for us, in terms of scale. But maybe one could still "pull support" for down-level pre-releases (i.e. if a question is obviously based on a beta rule set, corrected in Gold Master or 1E, then ignore it).<br/><br/>Andy, how did you address re-releasing all those updates? Did you offer credit or a reduction on the update price for folks with the "buggy" publications; or maybe even just a free errata PDF download? Did you just change the title page (and cover) and overwrite the POD online (i.e. Patched the Download)? Any sort of backlash from folks saying, "Woah, man, you've done two majors and umpty minors in less than a year; I want a refund!" Maybe that is, again, an Our Scale thing--not enough early adopters to mind?<br/><br/>I'm still wondering, though, about New Editions--what you, Andy, would enumerate "2.0.1" (I suppose).<br/><br/>FYI, GLASS had a 0.x enumeration right up until System Test Document 1.0, which has since had two changes to basic rules (current is, thus, 1.2). I will release "GLASS" as a "First Edition" even though it will have probably gotten up to somewhere around STD 1.5.x (where x is the number of editing passes the full book endures). In other words, STD 1.5.x wil be equivalent to GLASS 1E. Any subsequent major updates or changes to the basic rules will result in releasing "Polished GLASS" (GLASS 2E). And then it's done--I would rather build custom Game Types and maybe even release a Setting Book or two after that, long term....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232491/#Comment_232491" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T13:26:54+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  1:26PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My standard for version enumeration is different than standard useage, designed as it is for my own file structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI start my initial design with 1.0.  Whenever I make a change to previous text more substantative than "typo" fixing I save to a new file with a new decimal (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).  Whenever I make a change of such impact that it involves rewriting substantial sections of the text I bump to the next version (2.0, etc.).  Typically Alpha 2.0 or 3.0 will be the first version that is "playtestable".<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I reach a Beta Stage, I start the numbers over at 1.0.

Typically I'll create a whole new folder to save my Beta files to.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Universalis between Alpha and Beta versions there were probably 8 whole number versions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Blood Red Sands I think there were only 3 or 4 whole number versions but over a dozen decimal versions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Robots &amp; Rapiers I'm on Gamma Version 1.1  which is what I decided to call my current "back to formula" rewrite of that game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo definitely not software standard, but it helps alot to keep me organized.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232494/#Comment_232494" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T13:38:05+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  1:38PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's basically my approach:<br>STD 1.0 - ?<br>Alpha : I hope it is close enough to "done" I don't have to do interim stages, until:<br>Beta 1.0 - ?

As mentioned above, it's easy to "patch" pre-release--send out new beta pubs--but how do you "unpatch" to make those possessing the beta buy? What's to prevent someone with a beta from "self-patching" the last nuanced changes for Gold Master/Final Release?</blockquote>\nAside from the "not caring" solution already proposed, I doubt that there is one. One substantial difference between RPG releases and most software releases is that you are essentially shipping the source code rather than a compiled executable.<br><br>Really, though, I'm not sure that "public betas" are all that useful, even in the software world. Most of the popular video game-related "open betas" are probably more about marketing than about improving the product. Collecting useful feedback from a large group of people who are not good at giving feedback is a very "expensive" process.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Other's have disagreed, suggesting that they go into a playtest playing the game as if they were just sitting down to have fun with it...which I think violates the central tenet of "Everything you do has to be filtered through the lens of "is this helping me discover flaws in my product".  If you can enjoy play while rooting out flaws, that's a bonus.  But if you're enjoying play without really looking for or paying attention to flaws...or worse...subconciously auto-correcting for them...then you aren't playtesting.</blockquote>\nTo some extent I agree with you, but you also need to take into account that a product may have no individual "flaws" but still not be a good product. Testing to make sure that a game reliably delivers fun is important, too. Any particular playtest session should probably focus on one or the other, though (just like you shouldn't count on software usability testing to find bugs).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232538/#Comment_232538" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T19:38:42+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  7:38PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><br/>Andy, how did you address re-releasing all those updates?</blockquote>\nBasically, I updated the PDF on IPR (so that anyone can re-download it from their account), and on the mailing list when there was a major update, I either provided a direct download link or else asked them to email me directly.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Did you just change the title page (and cover) and overwrite the POD online (i.e. Patched the Download)?</blockquote>\nDidn't even change the cover or anything to reflect the version.

Reasons:<br/><br/>1) While there were updates, they weren't excessively major: Mostly clarifications onto existing material and grammar fixes. There was one Maid Power (out of 36) that needed a longer explanation to make sense, and that was the most important update IMO: Since we provided the errata and all online, there wasn't really any flak from the folks who got the print copy (and the PDF folks got free copies of each new version update).<br/><br/>2) In two cases, with some content change/relocalization of some text for clarification, the response was "YES!!! I got my hands on a LIMITED EDITION ORIGINAL PRINT!!!" In fact, one dude from Germany was adamant on getting a copy from me directly that was the 1.0.1 version, not a version with any fixes. So that was surprising.<br/><br/>But yeah, mainly the fact that the updates were minor (compared to other versions of games I've seen), and in fact there was not a single page added or removed, just the text reworked a little, plus the fact I offered free upgrades.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232619/#Comment_232619" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T10:23:37+00:00" title="September 16, 2009 10:23AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still thinking in terms of driving quality into designs (and stemming more from my hardware development experience than software), I am wondering if there are analogs to these concepts for RPGs:<br/><br/><b>Regression Tests</b>. A basic suite of tests that confirm you maintain a level of quality, since bugfixes frequently introduce new bugs. Maybe have a collection of successful actual play writeups and confirm that they would still be possible under the changed rules?<br/><br/><b>Formal Methods</b>. Using mathematics-style proofs to verify properties about your design. (Say, prove that your "endgame mechanic" will eventually be triggered, or prove that there are no deadlock situations).<br/><br/><b>Random and Directed-Random Testing</b>. Feeding automatically generated input into a design to find problems and stress conditions that human testers might not think of. (Usually requires a large number of tests, and some sort of "checking" mechanism to detect problems). This is a powerful technique but usually requires automation, so I'm not sure how you could take advantage of it in RPG testing.<br/><br/><b>Coverage</b>. Systematically tracking which parts of a design are stressed, both for an individual test and for your entire testing effort. (As a simple example, maybe give playtesters a checklist of subsystems and have them record each time they use a particular subsystem, so you can see which combination of subsystems were used during that session. You can then look at the cumulative results of all your sessions and direct future playtests to focus on the systems that haven't been getting enough attention).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232625/#Comment_232625" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T10:38:03+00:00" title="September 16, 2009 10:38AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes, well PDFs are quite similar to software, if you allow previous purchaser to re-download upon update.

Hmmm... I wonder. So some games offer "special mounts" or other cookies to get folks to pre-order (or come back, as I find on a quarterly basis for WOW and LOTR). Perhaps an Open Beta Edition could come with some similar bennie that would encourage folks to playtest and provide feedback (apparently, offering credit does nothing). And then having that bennie would be like a badge of honor, when the game releases to wild success. Luke does some of this with signed and numbered pre-orders, but he's LUKE CRANE and folks fall for that shit (and probably clamor to have access to playtest docs).<br/><br/>The best I've come up with is to offer anyone that provides me with feedback that leads to a substantive rules change a free copy of the final rules. But I have no idea what to do about reprinting after error-fixing, and that puts a BIG paralysis on my own development--I want to be SURE it's a solid game, so that none of my earliest adopters are screwed over by a "better" updated edition coming out after they shell out for the "worse" erroneous edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
