One of them was to deliberately shotgun "loose ends" at the players without knowing where they would lead and then tie them together in subsequent episodes.  This created a feel of intentional continuity for the players, even though I was just making it up as I went along.  They were thinking, "oh, so that's what that was for," but when I made that night's story, I was thinking, "oh, so that's what I could say that was for".  My crowning achievement came near the end of the 2 year long campaign from stitching together 5 or 6 incidents that had occurred over the life of the campaign and seeing the player's jaws drop as they realized what they had done.<br/><br/>I haven't read a huge amount on story-telling/writing techniques, so maybe this is an obvious technique, but what about you guys?  Do you have experiences with this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268239/#Comment_268239" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T01:34:55+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  1:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this come under the heading of reincorporation, a technique I greatly enjoy employing in all sorts of games.

But then again, I try to make sure at least half a dozen loose ends are available from every session. If one of my players decides to pick up on a loose end and re-incorporate it into the story, I'll give them bonuses in the form of automatic successes, bonus experience or reduced difficulty (depending on the game system we're using). Once players realise this after a couple of sessions, they actually start working toward tying up their own loose ends. It's a good primer for storytelling techniques when used in a game like D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268309/#Comment_268309" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T10:10:29+00:00" title="April 22, 2010 10:10AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done something like this in my current campaign.

The last campaign I was in was a Firefly/Martian Successor Nadesico/Time Travel mash-up using the Doctor Who rules, and pretty much everything that ended up being important by the end of the campaign began as a throwaway comment. Rather than getting a 'You're coll you thought of that', it becomes a 'We're cool we're rolling this way'. The fact that it wasn't pre-ordained doesn't really lessen the satisfaction of having it tie itself up so nicely.<br/><br/>I honestly can't imagine trying to run a game these days without a little of that improvisation being used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268324/#Comment_268324" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T11:06:46+00:00" title="April 22, 2010 11:06AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, reincorporation is a superb technique.

If you're not familiar with it, it's designed to do hard-boiled detective stories with no prep and the whole mystery is constructed right there at that table.  It's a game of implication, re-incorporation and retro-justification.  I love it.  It works really, really well.<br/><br/>Similarly I'm running a Maid game right now.  This example is a little more forward moving but the principle is the same.  Maid uses a lot of randomly generated events.  What I've been doing to prevent the game from being a string of disconnected crazy is tying each new random event to an already established element.<br/><br/>Random car crash was intentionally perpetrated by the Master's rival.  Random cursed doll is in fact that rival's secret weapon.  Random demon is from a computer virus the rival put on the computer.  Random portal to a fantasy world is created by the demon.  Random princess looking for help comes from the portal to the fantasy world.
