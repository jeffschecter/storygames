It strikes me as fascinating."</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what noted industry commentator Ken Hite said about Hot War, our game of secrets, lies, friends and enemies set in a post-apocalypse 1960s London, in his <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/outofthebox/2008/10/28/down-in-the-tube-station-at-midnight" rel="nofollow">'Out of the Box'</a> column!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeed more reasons to check out Hot War? Well, we've just made available another two free downloads to support your games.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off. we have a period map of London, downloadable as a two page PDF. This is something people have been asking for since the game was launched, so we are delighted to be able to oblige. The map is based on a genuine map available for travellers in the early 1960s, so it fits in perfectly with the time period. Print it out, scrawl on it, add your own notes and make it a tangible part of your Hot War games!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second new download was created by Sophie Melchior in New Zealand. After facilitating a game of Hot War at the Fright Night horror convention in Wellington, she was good enough to assemble her notes, characters and handouts into a complete pack that contains a game creation sheet, character sheets and handouts. We'd like to thank Sophie for taking the time to write all of this stuff up and for allowing us to host 'Project Breather' on our site.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can download both of these items <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/hotdown.html" rel="nofollow">direct from our website</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have something you'd like to see on the site, why not get in touch with us at hotwar (at) contestedground (dot) co (dot) uk.

That's the killer one.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: warren</cite>Superb!<br/><br/>Also, I love the idea of "The Hot War Transmission"... That's very cool indeed. And on a slight tangent, when will the Collective Endeavour Journal that was out at Dragonmeet be available in PDF? (For those of us who couldn't make it)</blockquote>\nIt should be availabler as a free PDF sometime over the next day or so. I'll let you know as soon as I know. There's a lot of good stuff in it, not just the Hot War stuff.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: warren</cite>As to other things I would like to see -- I think both the conflict quick reference sheet, mainly for a quick list of everything a character can do with his Victories (i.e. it costs 1 to lock one of your traits, and 2 to inflict a negative trait on your opponent, etc.) that I can hand out to my players instead of them asking me or passing the book around.</blockquote>\nYes, I'll get on to that ASAP. Sophie (who wrote up the Project Breather download) did something like that for her games and passed it on to me. I'll use that as a basis, so we could have something to go in the near future.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: warren</cite>'ve got a group ready to go for a Hot War campaign in the very near future. (I think people playing a combination of Fallout 3 and Left 4 Dead has got them in the mood for a combined nuclear/zombie apocalypse. I'll try to note down our Game Creation Sheet on the wiki as well).<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Warren</blockquote>\nGreat!

It's a great piece of work. I think all of the articles in it are really worthwhile. Andy Kenricks article on Salisbury Plain for Hot War had me really wanting to use it in a game very soon. I'll need to get round to that. I also hope that my brief piece on real life gangsters in Hot War is both helpful and provokes further reading.<br/><br/>Weirdly, Paul and I were talking about a poster pack not too long ago. I'll add that to the list of positive ideas!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kobayashi</cite><br/>Yes, in fact I'm a huge Watkins fan and I already saw most of the movies/series you talk about (which made me wonder, "<i>Is this guy reading my mind ?</i>").

His work is quite captivating although, to my annoyance, I have yet to see his piece on the Paris Commune. I've managed to watch snippets of it but not the full thing. Will need to try and resolve that issue!<br/><br/>I know I keep banging on about this, but for anyone wanting to get a fee for how I envisage Hot War, The War Game and Threads are absolutely key. The utter horror of nuclear war really is captured in both of those films. The War Game is certainly my favourite of the two, but it's a tough call.<br/><br/>For those wondering what we're talking about, the film &amp; TV mediography for Hot War can be found <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/hotmed.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The book also contains an extensive fictiona and non-fiction printed bibliography and a 'gamesography', both RPGs and computer games.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
