It's called Bowman's, and it's one of those places that serves up heaps of fried seafood. And when I say heaps, I mean it. You walk in, and they bring you a mighty hill of hushpuppies with real butter. For a very reasonable price, you get a heroic platter that's had golden brown delicious sea critters SHOVELED on until you're afraid that upsetting this  mountain of food will cause it all to topple. And it's all really damn good seafood, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Maid RPG is the Bowman's Admiral Platter of the RPG world. <br/>\n<br/>\nI buy this thing for eight dollars. Eight friggin dollars got me a game engine I would never have imagined using, a ton of really great content, and a surprisingly hilarious narrative that's woven into explaining the game. 220 plus pages of just plain fun content. Making characters is a snap, and half the fun is seeing what those wondrous random tables spit out and then turning all that stuff into an actual character. I love how conflict resolution works, and the fact that this RPG is willing to try shit I'd never imagine in a hundred thousand years. Having a characters stress explosion be acted out in real time? Such crazy genius.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe extra content, like a Bowman's meal, borders almost on the excessive. There's so many sample characters, sample scenarios, just samples of stuff that like staring down that massive pile of fried food, I'm thinking "I do not possibly need all this!" But then I take it all, and it's great, so it's okay. The replays were especially entertaining, and showed just how versatile the system really is.<br/>\n<br/>\nHoly geez, what an awesome find. Thank you Andy K, Ewen, and Kamiya san for this. I can't wait for the opportunity to actually play this, since I just had so much fun reading it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194960/#Comment_194960" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T19:25:36+00:00" title="March  1, 2009  7:25PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dittos here.

Let me know how it works.<br/><br/>During my lunch hour at work, I'm fucking around on a laptop with Maidhammer 40444 (\u6b7b\u970a\u6b7b\u6b7b\u6b7b). It's going to be a collection of a few scenarios in a dark fantasy/SF and wacky Maid crossover game (if you know the manga "Blame!", think the "Blame!: High School" issue).<br/><br/>I've got a new maid weapon and maid uniform color chart (I'll post tomorrow, they're on my work PC), and am working on some specific Dark Heresy-themed random events.<br/><br/>It's all the fault of Ross from Fantasy Flight Games, who is the line editor for Dark Heresy. I ran over to him to get Dark Heresy, he ran over to me to get Maid, and in the mutual love-fest we got our chocolate in our peanut butter. If nothing else, it'll be a (hopefully) great one-shot series that gives a thumbs up to the silly side of Warhammer 40k/DH without making fun of it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194974/#Comment_194974" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T21:16:10+00:00" title="March  1, 2009  9:16PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, also: The 1.2 ("revised": Read that as "fixed 3 rules errors, a ton of grammar errors, and relocalized some of the dialogue") version of Maid is now with IPR (as well as in the hands of everyone who previously purchased the book).
