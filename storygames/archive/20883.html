Reminds me a little bit of Ben Lehman's <i>Bliss Stage</i>.<br/><br/>Has this been playtested? I'm curious about some of the mechanics, and wondering if you'd like to discuss them here or not.<br/><br/>Just the overview is worth a read, though - it's an intense and fascinating premise delivered in relatively few words.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458356/#Comment_458356" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-27T00:43:44+00:00" title="November 27, 2016 12:43AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2016 1:02AM by Paul_T.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Davide,<br/><br/>I'm quite sure the second instance of:<br/><br/>"If you didn\u2019t extinguish your debt and it\u2019s 5 or less..."<br/><br/>is a typo.

While I worked on xpandables I kept away from it to avoid too many influences (not that they're not good, but there's only so much stimuli my brain can take in...). So basically, no, no real influence from Bliss Stage. <br/>I didn't see the Black Mirror show you mentioned, but I'll try to find a copy to look at.<br/>The game basically was born because I was wondering how could I make the player/character separation to be part of the game... and as the player "moves" the character around without being there, I had this idea of the pilots "using" the cyborgs without being there in person (thus free to do any sort of crazy stunt with those cyborgs, during the missions).<br/><br/>Playtest is a bit of sore spot for this game: I did a few rounds of tests that for my taste were inconclusive and in any case did some more design iterations after that, but those changes were not tested.<br/>My groups are not much into sci-fi and the like, and therefore we never had a chance to pick it up again; then other games ate all my brainpower and attention, so I left it untouched for a while.<br/>It had a good number of downloads and positive comments but as much as I begged (and I did) even those that wrote to say that they liked it and played it, didn't provide any actual play or substantial feedback.<br/><br/>My understanding is that it's solid enough, but it might still have horrible issues that weren't ironed out and that I missed (unconsciously fixing them in playtesting).<br/>So yes, in other words, any playtesting is more than welcome!<br/>Mechanics can be discussed here, for sure: it has been a while since I worked on it and I might remember a few things wrong, but I'm here and pleased to answer questions if you have anything to ask or discuss.<br/><br/>Finally, yes, that "5 or less" is a leftover of a copy-paste and has been changed to 5 or more. I will update the pdf on RpgNow.

It's very relevant to the game, I think.<br/><br/>One thing that jumps out at me is how ever-present Strings are. I see what you're going for, but it's a bit... overwhelming. I wonder (as someone who's never played the game, so take this with a grain of salt) if you might get some more mileage of splitting Strings up into multiple currencies (or effects). <br/><br/>For instance, what if you collected Strings and Grudges? Strings would come from manipulating people and getting a hold over them (and could be used for more of the same). Grudges, however, would come from getting hurt or manipulated, and, could, in turn, be spent to increase harm done and other "aggressive" uses of Strings. (And could be removed by use of the violent moves, and so forth.)<br/><br/>Where this could be interesting and/or juicy is if some situations or moves called the player to take one of these, but left the choice up to them. "Your friend has just done *this* to you. How do you feel about it? Do you take a Grudge?"<br/><br/>I think it could create some more interesting choices and interactions, as well as reveal something about the characters' relationships. <br/><br/>From a ruleset design point of view, however, it would just be less stuff to remember for the players. (I believe you have about a dozen uses for Strings, or maybe many more, in your text!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458417/#Comment_458417" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-29T18:18:21+00:00" title="November 29, 2016  6:18PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strings and Grudges definitely sound like an interesting option.<br/><br/>The only possible issue I can imagine is that it will be like using <b>2 different currencies</b>.<br/>I know Strings have a ton of usages, but I hoped that in the mind of a new player it would translate into "<i>well, it's always good to earn strings on someone, because I can use them to my advantage in almost any situation</i>" (glancing down at the list of uses).<br/><br/>Having Strings <b>and</b> Grudges could perhaps complicate things?<br/>Players would have to keep track of two different currencies, and there would be probably all those moments of<br/> "Well, I am spending one String to..." <br/>"No, you can't, you need a Grudge for that" (for example to deal +1 harm)... <br/>"Oh, ok, so I guess that String counts for nothing" <br/>I know it counts for nothing <b>only now</b> or instead it should be pushing towards maybe a different sort of action, where the string could be exploited... but perhaps a single currency keeps the 'metagaming' part to the minimum.<br/><br/>I actually do love the example you made, but I need to think about this a bit more.<br/><br/>I've read the synopsis of the Black Mirror and it really sounds great! Very close to what I had in mind with Xpandables!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
