I posted <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27491.0" rel="nofollow">a similar message</a> to this one on the Forge at the start of the year. I'd be interested to hear what this crowd thinks of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it has slowed a bit lately, for a while I spent an inordinate amount of time publishing ad hoc web articles about probability in RPGs, from some <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://exalted.xi.co.nz/wiki/wiki.pl?ExcellencyMath" rel="nofollow">basic stuff</a> to some <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://asteroid.divnull.com/2008/01/chance-of-reign/" rel="nofollow">not-so-basic stuff</a>. Partially based on the reaction I've got from these, I am contemplating writing a "probability for roleplayers" type book (probably a free PDF).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking it will be about half theory/general principles, half specific examples from particular (openly licensed) games, with the examples getting progressively more complicated. I have a pretty decent list of the topics I would want to see in such a book. I also have a pretty clear idea of how I want it to look.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm curious about some things though, which hopefully this community can answer:\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n[li]Would you even read such a book?[/li][li]What about probability do you wish you knew more about?[/li][li]Are there particular examples of situations or mechanics in specific games that you've wondered how the probability a) works and b) can be figured out?

What does a "bonus die" do if you have an <em>x</em>d6 system, and the bonus means you take the best <em>x</em> (effectively, drop the lowest)? What does a bonus die do for a d10 pool system?

For example...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thadrine</cite>Tell me this.<br/><br/>What is the average totals of a roll and keep system using d10's?<br/><br/>So if I roll 7 and keep 3 what is the average total going to be?<br/>Compared with?<br/>Roll 5 and keep 3?</blockquote>\nRoll 7 keep 3 highest sum them? You can estimate the average by the following procedure. First, we're about to treat the range of results as continuous rather than discrete (you can "roll" a 3.4, for example). To do this in a nice way, give each real result (like 5) a range of numbers around it - 1/2 and + 1/2 (so 4.5 to 5.5). Now put the 7 dice on the range distributed uniformly - split up the range from 0.5 to 10.5 into 8 equal parts, and put a die between each part. So the first (lowest) goes at 0.5+10/8=1.75, the next at 3, then 4.25, 5.5, 6.75, 8, 9.25. Grab the top 3 and add them together, and there's your answer. 6.75+8+9.25 is 24.<br/><br/>Roll 5 keep 3? Split into 6 equal parts, take the top 3. That's 5.5+7.166+8.333=21 average.<br/><br/>Those estimates are pretty close to right, though not exact. Let's see... the real answers are 23.94 and 21.46 (simulations). This method would really benefit from a better layout, pictures would make it crystal clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238844/#Comment_238844" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T06:35:20+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  6:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love probability, and find it fascinating, but I'm mind-numbingly bad at wrapping my mind around the math involved (which probably contributes to its mystique to me).

Something more interactive might have more legs.  I really like Guy's approach, especially as an estimate.  I'm not clear, I'll admit, on why the expectation "highest of seven" works out as an even division of the values of the variable - I'd have expected something with more of a curve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335373/#Comment_335373" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T11:18:17+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 11:18AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An even "dirtier" version of Guy's esti-method is just to imagine a few dice in "typical" outcomes, spread throughout the range, but centered on the average.<br/><br/>For example, rolling 5 d6s and taking the two lowest:<br/><br/>Imagine you have a roughly even spread. We have five dice and six possible outcomes, so we have to leave out one outcome. Which one? Five dice could show up 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. That's a low outcome. Or maybe 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. That's a high outcome. Let's use both!<br/><br/>That gives you totals of 3 (low) and 5 (high), and a vague sense of the average result (something around 4). And if you do the math, the average roll of 5d6, keep the lowest two, is something like 4.07.<br/><br/>If you have 4 dice, keep the lowest two, it's easier: just imagine a roll of typical results clustered around the middle -&gt; 2, 3, 4, and 5.<br/><br/>That's a result of 5. Let's check the math (using anydice.com here): it gives us an average of 4.66. In the ballpark, right?<br/><br/>If you've got more dice than outcomes, keep "imagining" results around the middle/average. So, for lowest two of 8 dice, I might "imagine" 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and then add another 3 and 4. That hypothetical roll would be a "3" (keeping the two lowest). The actual average is 3.11. <br/><br/>However, obviously, using this method in this case you'll get the same result for 6 dice as you would for 8 dice. But you can also "guesstimate" what, say, 5 dice, 7 dice, and 9 dice would look like and then get a sense of the range. In this particular example, this won't help you much, as you can see, but often you can draw a rough "curve" of what the probability might look like by estimating this way.<br/><br/>It can give you a (very) rough sense of what typical (or average) rolls might be like, but then you'll have to do the actual math if you're serious about using that in a design. You'll need to know what your extremes are like, as well, and those are much easier to estimate mathematically (there are fewer ways to roll "unlikely" results, so it's easier to do the math). Still, can be a handy "estimate" tool, just like measuring a distance by "pacing off": useful as long as you remember how easily you could be way, way off. You're essentially taking a guess. You'll need to get to a calculator or a spreadsheet or both then to see if your guesses are in the right "zone", and whether that's a mechanic that's worth pursuing for what you want to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335377/#Comment_335377" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T11:47:29+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 11:47AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What?
