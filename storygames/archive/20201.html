I'd been thinking about <a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/role-playing-poems/" rel="nofollow">role-playing poems</a> for a couple reasons. One is that I've played Shane McLean's Cheat Your Own Adventure <a href="https://rpggeek.com/thread/1313586/choose-cheat-your-own-adventure-review" rel="nofollow">(link to a review I wrote)</a>  a few times recently and really had a blast with it. Daniel Solis' <a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/talk-find-make-punch-proof-problems.html" rel="nofollow">Talk Find Make</a>, too. Another reason is Jonna Hind's <a href="https://rpggeek.com/thread/1324244/play-10-different-roleplaying-games-1-day-challeng" rel="nofollow">Play 10 RPGs in One Day challenge</a> on RPGGeek, which I am gonna try to accomplish next month. So I'd been googling and sort of idly collecting sources for these games anyway, and I decided it might be useful to start compiling a sort of Index for these games. There are so many of them, and more than a few of them are good. <br/><br/>I'm deliberately being a bit more flexible than the creator's definition. Anything that plays in less than an hour by default is gonna be fair game, though my focus right now is on stuff that more strictly fits the definition (according to Tomas HV M\xf8rkrid: "a game that plays in 15 minutes or less where the idea is to investigate a mood or scene or something else of limited scope."), So far my effores have also concentrated on games that self-describe as role-playing poems. I'm not bothering to filter out games that were evidently jokes. I'm not searching for any relevant games from related disciplines; so no Fluxus games or improv exercises (yet). I have a separate sheet for games that are written in verse or where the point of the game is to produce verse, as they can often be found close by in searches. I also have a sheet listing sources that I'm aware of but haven't yet scoured for entries. Notably, I haven't yet tackled <del>the 42 games on Marc Majcher's blog</del> (done), or the 30 on Dave Cleaver's. I've still managed to add 80 entries so far to the main list. I have a space for descriptions which I've mostly left empty, since many of the games are not that much longer than it would take to describe them.<br/><br/>I've successfully achieved a solid 3+ hours of procrastination in this way! <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HsbwrHVxiF2FHXgtlUmc5iqMjssgompI1VmAbBWv_xY/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">And here is the results of my labors</a>. If you'd like to help out, please feel free to point me in the directions of games that I've missed in this thread. Or if you'd like to lend a hand more directly and would like editing privileges, shoot me your e-mail address or G+ info. And if your poem is on here, but you'd prefer me to link to it in a different way (or not at all?) just let me know and I'll take care of it ASAP.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445528/#Comment_445528" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-05T08:02:47+00:00" title="June  5, 2015  8:02AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2015 10:01AM by Rafu.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great and useful resource!<br/><br/><del>I might be mistaken, but I think you might be missing the works of <a href="http://gamepoems.gizmet.com/" rel="nofollow">Marc Majcher</a> and <a href="https://leaveittome.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Dave Cleaver</a>.
