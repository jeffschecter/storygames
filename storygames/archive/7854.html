I kind of enjoyed it, though, but I can definitely see how it could have ruined the mood.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's how I usually do it: I and the others at my table set stakes, and we go to negotiating only if someone is really uncomfortable with them. If someone feels "Hmm, I'm not sure about that," we usually roll with it, but if you feel "No, that's not how it's supposed to be, that ruins my fun," then you say "Hey, wait a minute. I'm not comfortable with that." We avoid prenegotiating unless something is really wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, we played Shock: the other day, without prenegotiation until right at the end, when another player set the stakes as my character turning his company to funding ecoterrorism, and I go "Woah! I really don't think he'd do that." and he goes "Yeah, ok, but what if he just starts reforming his company into a more environmentally friendly one?" and I go "Yeah, that makes sense." There's a difference between hashing out exactly what happens, and saying no when someone's taking the fiction in the wrong direction. I do agree that I made a bad decision there, and it'd been great if one of you had stopped me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were many factors involved there, like me playing over Skype for the second time ever (and the first time was really short) and not being used to not being able to gauge people's contentment by their expressions, and you guys not being familiar with the game, so not knowing wether you could interrupt me. You can definitely reject bad stakes without doing prenegotiation to the point of defining any details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
