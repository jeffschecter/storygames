It has been a joyride, from the first two groups back in 1995, and up until today; when I do 6-7 groups a'week and two "play RPGs the whole week, and have a daily walk in the woods" summer-camps.<br/>Looking forward to the 20th season with my game <i>Fabula</i>, I'm of course trying to reinvent the game setting (again). This time we will play black orcs from early fall to late spring next year. Half a dozen campaigns set in orc country and culture. But what will we do? How do we get these "black orcs" to become something more than a mere postulate?<br/><br/><b>BLACK ORCS</b><br/>This is what I know: they are blackish green in skin, proud and independent, approximately the same height as humans, living in the deserts and steppes on the continent of <i>Moria</i>. They ride fearsome "trihorns" (triceratops) into battle, and have animal masters and mighty shamans amongst them, calling strong spirits from nature.<br/><br/>Their lands are situated between a very strong human realm to the north, and a vast region ruled by desert-dwelling "gnomes" (several sheikdoms, inspired by persian and arabic culture) to the south.<br/><br/>The black orcs themselves are divided into a handful of nations, and some (all?) of them have been known to be under the rule of a "khan".<br/><br/><b>However; little more is known to me. </b><br/>Up until now I have not done any work on their culture, and that is what I need to do now, to make the black orc playable in a wider perspective. I hope for some help doing that.<br/><br/>- How do they live; in huts, tents, caves, carts?<br/>- Are they nomadic? If they are; how do that manifest in their culture?<br/>- What songs do they sing? Do they dance? Sports?<br/><br/>- How do they govern themselves? Are they feudal, meritocratic, democratic, other?<br/>- Are there several states? (or tribes) Do they all bow to one central authority? <br/>- Do they have one or more widely known population centers? Why?<br/><br/>- A shaman calling forth a spirit; how does the shaman do it? What IS a spirit? What will it do for the shaman?<br/>- How do they bury their dead? Where to the dead soul go?<br/>- Do they have special festivals? Sacred places?<br/><br/>- Do the black orcs have cultural trappings which may be revolting to humans (and possibly; the players)?<br/><br/>Any answers, speculations, ideas are welcome!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436237/#Comment_436237" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T10:03:36+00:00" title="August  2, 2014 10:03AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They expose their dead on sky-platforms made of sticks lashed together by braided grass, that carrion flocks may eat of their flesh and so disperse the soul to the six corners of Earth, thus may it never be captured and bound.<br/><br/>No funeral is held until the bones are picked clean. Only then is their mourning, as the bones are passed out among lovers and family and friends, to be whittled with symbols of luck and fortune and warding, or carved with story-glyphs in remembrance, then wrapped with leather thongs and strung about the girdle or braided into hair or hung over doorways.<br/><br/>Some keep a bone-fetch for years upon years, pass them down through generations, cast them to tell fortunes; some might lay them to rest in this sacred place or that, in places made holy by prayer or bloodshed or birth.<br/><br/>If a ghost or evil spirit happens by, stupid and hungry for mortal souls, offer it a bone of your father, saying "Here is sustenance for you!" But of course there is nothing there, the soul is gone to the six corners, and like a fat child with his hand stuck in a clay jug the spirit will be snared and bound to your will. Braid it in your hair and it will whisper to you, clatter when danger is near, beg and offer promises in exchange for its freedom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436248/#Comment_436248" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T12:29:57+00:00" title="August  2, 2014 12:29PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Figure out how relations are between the nations.  Probably at least one that resents or refuses the Khan.<br/><br/>Give these nations names, flags, distinctive armor, etc.  Can you be a member of more than one nation (if your parents are from different nations)?  Is there tension between the nations? History? Pride?  Get political.<br/><br/>Are the nations divided into tribes/clans?  Give each tribe/clan a name and a flag, and figure out the relations between the clans.  Same questions as above, but drilling down one level.<br/><br/>Are there half-orc/half-humans?  If so, how are they treated?<br/><br/>Think about how labor is divided in your nations.  Are there specialist jobs?  Are there builders, crafters, guards, cooks, porters, etc?  Are jobs divided on a racial or political basis?  Are there castes?  Is there any resentment or ill-will there? Insubordination? Sabotage?<br/><br/>There are probably some groups within society that cut across national boundaries.  Religions, secret societies, labor collectives ("unions"), professions, etc.<br/><br/>Come up with one "representative" from each clan/tribe/group. This will be the one your PCs interact with, who will represent the opinions of his clan/tribe/group.  Give him a name. What does he want? What does he hate?

So, for every broad cultural rule you choose, come up with something that seems like it breaks that rule, and then describe how these two traditions coexist.  That way, you get a more nuanced and distinctive culture.<br/><br/>Example: <br/><br/><b>Broad rule:</b> orcs are very fluid in their ties to other orcs, and "loyalty" is not valued.  "Ally with the strongest" is the prevailing notion, and this lack of ongoing trust is part of what has kept orc civilization small-scale, with groups seldom exceeding 150.<br/><br/><b>Seeming contradiction:</b> orcs are incredibly loyal to their trihorns, and will risk their lives to save or stay with the trihorn they ride.  When a trihorn is killed, its orc goes into a severe mourning, and it be may be a long time, if ever, until the orc finds a new mount.<br/><br/><b>Reconciliation:</b> orcs see themselves as the spirits of nature -- implacable and merciless (goes well with harsh desert living).  They are born and thrive and compete against the other forces in the universe, conquering what they can before they fade away as if they'd never been.  (Or maybe if "nature" is too broad, go with "orcs are spirits of the scathing noon sun".)  Trihorns, on the other hand, are seen as the spirits of the sky and of the gods -- wise, majestic, eternal, mysterious and noble.  As mere spirits, orcs do not actually <i>pray</i> to trihorns, but they venerate them and are greatly distressed when any harm comes to them.  An orc's bond to his trihorn is the seat of his connection to god and the sublime.<br/><br/>That's how I come up with stuff that seems cool and memorable to me, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436294/#Comment_436294" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T05:34:42+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  5:34AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2014 5:36AM by James_Stuart.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is going to seem sudden and out of nowhere, but this thread is closed, and you're banned, Tomas.<br/><br/>For context, a thread where he proposes "Indian Orcs":<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15217/indians-negotiations-and-culture/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15217/indians-negotiations-and-culture/p1</a><br/><br/>And a followup here:<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15283/bad-culture-developing/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15283/bad-culture-developing/p1</a><br/><br/>You were warned by Andy at those threads that if you tried to start this type of discussion again, you'd be kicked off the site.
