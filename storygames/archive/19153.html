That is, play that isn't broken up, either by the rules or by the GM, into set units like Turns or Scenes or Tests or Encounters.  I'm talking about play where player choices emerge and are made and have their outcomes as part of a free flow of conversation and narration, without being organized or broken up into units.<br/><br/>By "decision identification" I mean the ability of anyone at the table to notice, and everyone at the table to agree, whether a given decision is or is not "relevant".  And by "relevant", I mean both consequential (the choice impacts an outcome we care about) and informed (we're not proceeding from deep ignorance of the "might as well flip a coin" variety).<br/><br/>So I'm talking about something that's very simple in retrospect -- this decision was relevant and deserved some play time and effort, while that decision wasn't and didn't -- but very often botched in practice.<br/><br/>If you've ever formed an elaborate plan for dealing with waiting hostiles, only to charge into an empty room... if you've ever argued with your buddies over whether to go left or right, then found the paths connected in a loop... if you've ever come across a random fork in the road and grinded out competing theories on the pros and cons of each path, losing track of the fact that it was all speculation... if you've ever gotten into a pattern of making every decision quickly, so as to not waste time, but then one day you charge into a direction that costs you what you wanted... these are what I'm referring to as problems of decision identification.<br/><br/>This field of problems has been solved in various ways for different play agendas, but I think it still has <i>not</i> been solved for some pretty common ones.  Fiction-first challenge-based play and character-based immersive exploration are two that come to mind -- as far as I'm aware, house rules and informal best practices lead the way here, without ever having become particularly transferable to new GMs and groups.  In other words, I don't know a core game text (as opposed to a module) that supports OD&amp;D or CoC-style play and also covers decision identification.<br/><br/>Has anyone else observed this phenomenon?  Am I describing it accurately?  Do you consider it solved?<br/><br/>I've got some ideas about helpful principles that might be simple enough to turn into rules or easy-to-follow advice, but first I'd like to see if this post makes any sense to anyone and what y'all's thoughts are.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427397/#Comment_427397" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-18T20:26:59+00:00" title="January 18, 2014  8:26PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So fiction-first challenge based play, that's like hack-and-slash D&amp;D, right? <br/><br/>In those situations, discovering that a left/right decision leads in a loop (or that one ends in a dead end) may be disappointing but it isn't <i>meaningless.</i>  Right?

Players feel duped.<br/><br/>One solution to this problem is radical transparency, possibly coupled with an explicit rule that "THE STORY" is only exactly what happens.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>Players are unexpectedly interested in hieroglyphs<br/>GM: What's so interesting about those hieroglyphs to you?<br/>Player: My character thinks they're related to the artifact from the tomb, blah blah blah<br/>GM: Cool!

Please ignore it then!  I don't consider it central; hopefully my other examples are better.<br/><br/><b>Dirk</b>, I'd say that, when this playstyle is worth supporting (as opposed to when no one's getting anything out of it, in which case, yeah, radical transparency FTW), it's because of the consensual illusion of objective reality.  The notion is not that there's a real <i>story</i> -- as you said, the story is only exactly what happens -- but rather that there's a real <i>world</i> for the players to explore and contend with via their characters.<br/><br/>That said, incorrectly guessing how best to traverse the fictional world can be just as frustrating as incorrectly guessing what the real story is.  I think a big key to making this all work is ensuring that the effort is <i>not</i> mere guessing.  As a GM, I'm less than perfect at assembling fun deduction challenges, thus my need to sometimes fall back on "Announce dead-ends quickly" and "When in doubt, make stuff useful".<br/><br/><b>Paul</b>, I think "GM should have a reason for including choice" is maybe half the battle, with "players should have a reason for treating fiction like it's a choice" as the other half.  As for wandering monsters, sadly I've played some OSR sessions where we've found hieroglyphs in a monster-free zone.  I'm a huge fan of "announce future badness", but I hate "the players are interested in something; I must interrupt them" as a universal GM response.

If it took you 10 minutes of talking to decide what to do, then it calls for a Wandering Monster roll, yeah? And one more turn of your light sources expiring, etc. Thus, the inconsequential is rarely <i>actually</i> inconsequential.<br/><br/>Whereas, for different sorts of CA, I'd say it comes down to a matter of <i>prep</i>. How do you prep for a game and <i>how binding is that prepped material</i> during actual play?<br/><br/>Most games I find myself playing these days, any given piece of prep is to be taken as a dependable but ultimately disposable suggestion. That is, if somebody off-handedly mentioned hieroglyphics on the wall and those hieroglyphics caught somebody else's attention, <i>those hieroglyphics are now relevant</i>. This category also includes, I'd say, <i>all</i> games arranged any other way than the "one GM/many character-players" divide.<br/><br/><b>If your prep is tightly binding</b> - that is, it's not a legit move to just make the hieroglyphics matter - then:<br/><br/>\xb7 for some games, let's say a challenge-based investigative game where <i>not</i> solving the case is a possible outcome, red herrings are just part of the challenge. There should be <i>some</i> way (either abstract/mechanical or a pointer in the fiction) that the players can discover the hieroglyphics are not a clue and stop bothering, though. Note that this is pure speculation because I don't know of any actual game designed this way.<br/><br/>\xb7 some other games, including inconsequential hieroglyphics was just bad prep, and that the players are focusing on those really is a problem. From a GM point of view, you can still fix that by telling them the hieroglyphics don't matter, <i>before</i> it's too late.

I'm a huge fan of "announce future badness", but I hate "the players are interested in something; I must interrupt them" as a universal GM response.  There's still plenty of awareness and judgment required there.</blockquote>\nJust to clarify my statements above, I'm not just talking about "interrupting the players" (which can easily be overdone/feel artificial), but about thinking about the whole game process from that perspective. Whether it's game design, scenario design, or play-at-the-moment, there should be some consideration given to this problem, at each of those three levels. So, for instance, resources-wasted-including-time, wandering monster checks, and aggressive scene framing/cutting are possible solutions. But so is starting in a situation/setup which puts time pressure on the characters, for example. <br/><br/>In Apocalypse World, "announce off-screen badness" works really well because the setting/conceit is dangerous and volatile by default ("no status quos", etc.), this is supported by genre (everyone in the post-apocalypse is likely to be, or become, a dangerous and unpredictable psychopath) as well as by mechanics (setup for holdings and start-of-session moves all identify problems that constantly harass the PCs), nothing and no one is safe, and the MC has been instructed to create "Fronts" which may and should "advance" to create danger or problems for the PCs.<br/><br/>In a relationship drama, there should be NPCs who are acting or reacting to current events and therefore likely to be up to something or to react in significant ways to choices the PCs make. And so forth.<br/><br/>A raw "let's explore some stuff and resolve events according to what would be most likely to happen" is much more likely to run into this kind of problem, naturally. I don't think it can fly without some kind of solution to this (or the group being willing to waste time on a constant basis, of course).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427437/#Comment_427437" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-19T11:58:18+00:00" title="January 19, 2014 11:58AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>I dont think there is a general answer to the question here.

I'm guessing the latter -- as much as BW cares about the fiction, my experience has always been that it's a very "rules first" game.  The mechanics demand and reward you for your time and attention, and I've found that "how to play" is heavily informed by that.

Maybe this is a seperate conversation, but it seems like there are rules solutions that would work for a variety of pitfalls in this type of play, if players and GMs were willing to follow the rules faithfully.

"I was playing to find out what happened! I was thinking about what might happen just now, not pre-planning!" yells the GM, and fully, absolutely believes it.<br/><br/>This is what I was trying to get at at the end of the previous thread when I said that the text of (many editions of) D&amp;D categorically do not state or imply that the role of the DM is a strictly neutral arbiter of a rigorously simulated world, so it can't be deception when, absent discussion, a DM fails to be that.  (I mean, yes, some people do assume that's what a DM should do, but they do so <i>in the face of</i> clearly written descriptions of what a DM does in a game of D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>That's also why I was a little off-base in my earlier reply, I was still thinking of a situation in these terms:<br/><br/>* A set of GM instructions that doesn't create a singular set of criteria (principles?) for each and every decision to be assigned a particular amount of importance.<br/>* A group of players who don't feel they can just ask "so is this important or no?"<br/>* A GM whose interests and evaluation of others' interest differs from the actual collective interests of the group (assuming the group has a collective interest in the first place)<br/><br/>In such circumstances, it doesn't make a lot of sense to try to determine fault or blame - the designer can rightly say "I gave you flexible tools with which to pursue your own interests", the GM can rightly say "I gave you material that I thought you'd find interesting/fascinating" and the players can rightly say "that was stupid/boring/pointless."  <br/><br/>In short, I think we're just talking about a matter of taste and should focus on ways for people to be able to express their tastes to each other clearly.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427449/#Comment_427449" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-19T18:46:53+00:00" title="January 19, 2014  6:46PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My position is that, while no RPG rule can make everyone follow it all the time, some rules get followed more than others, and there are reasons for that, grounded in usability and feedback.  Simply saying "Announce dead-ends quickly" and "When in doubt, make stuff useful" doesn't invoke the same type of immediate feedback and reinforcement as "make a Test, check off a box toward Skill improvement".  The game designer's responsibility, in my eyes, is to give the players the right sort of bang for their buck when it comes to following rules.  On this front, GM advice is simply inferior to useful buttons you can push.<br/><br/>In any game other than a GMed RPG, one way forward should be clear -- if you want someone to announce dead ends quickly, reward them for doing it with feedback that suits their aims in play.  But what are a traditional GM's aims in play?  They're all social -- the fiction poses no challenge or obstacle.  So the only button a GM is going to want to press is one that earns consistent excitement or appreciation from the players.  Sounds like a tall order to me.  Not impossible, but tricky.  Plus I'm still not sure that laying this responsibility on the GM is the best solution.\n<blockquote>Could there be a procedure for assessing the stakes that weighs opportunity cost of the decision time?

I do this informally by reminding players of coming threats, worsening situations elsewhere, etc.  The part I've found difficult is: applying this to <i>every</i> stake assessment.

Uninformed decisions are the problem case, because players who lack information, but somehow approach a decision as meaningful anyway, will grasp about for, or invent, info that isn't there.  The solution would be to recognize that uninformed decisions are not meaningful.  "How to achieve that recognition?" is part of the point of this thread.<br/><br/>I get your point about designed decisions; I'm talking instead about emergent decisions which were not designed by anyone -- the players say, "What's over here?" and the GM ad-libs an answer adn the players go poke at it.<br/><br/>As for dead time, sort of.  I'm talking about how to avoid <i>wasted</i> time in improvised play.  When I hear "dead" I think "dull".

So, this sounds like you're trying to "patch" this kind of system for those that don't like the standard solutions. Yes? Sorta? No?<br/><br/>Because I'm more in the camp that the hieroglyphics should be <i>made</i> to matter. But this can <i>really</i> get away from the prepped material.

Gotcha. I meant a specific technique in "how to make the hieroglyphics <i>important</i> when they didn't even exist a moment ago"; maybe some of my oomph will stick on ya. I'm going to make up my own jargon and call it Fiction As Rule (don't worry, I've already forgotten it, too)<br/><br/>First, rather than say: "the hieroglyphics are interesting because they might matter" we should say: "the hieroglyphics <i>will</i> matter because we think that they are interesting". In other words: " Look! Hieroglyphics! Cool!"  That's an established, immutable fact now. We latched on to them as worth pursuing. But matter how? And to what extent? <br/><br/>Well, what are we doing? What's the Adventure? What's the goal? By definition, the hieroglyphics must matter to the goal or they are merely interesting, not <i>meaningful</i>. Let's start simply: save the princess from the dragon. That's the goal (stay with me, we'll address "moving the goal post" shortly). This technique is largely system agnostic but assumes some method of determining what we will call "pass/fail" for the moment (roll dice, vote, bid, pull from the Jenga tower) in relation to the task at hand (Perception check; Lore skill; De cypher; whatever is appropriate).<br/><br/>If you succeed (failure dealt with shortly), you learn something meaningful about your goal. But what? How long before the Princess is devoured? Unlikely (I certainly wouldn't advocate that). Where she is? Maybe, if it tells us where the dragon lair is. How about how to kill the dragon? Aha! Writ here is the means to slay the ancient beast! It's weakness. What weakness? A missing scale? Trite. A dragon slaying sword? Triter(?). It's heart is not in its body but hid away in a glass container. Cool! (Hey, I like it. Doesn't your system have some means of establishing narrative control?  Who's turn it is.  Who rolled? Who holds the talking stick? Group consensus? GM fiat? System agnostic suggests the most interesting suggestion wins).<br/><br/>We now know how to kill the dragon. What else must we know? That depends on the length of the adventure and what we deem to be meaningful; that is to say: what we find interesting IS meaningful to our quest. And of course finite resources! But lets address failure first.<br/><br/>We can only fail forward. The hieroglyphics ARE meaningful, but on a failure they can only point us to the next meaningful encounter. Another chance to learn/win/establish something. The writing on the medallion doesn't tell us where the Well of Souls is (crap!) BUT it does tell us how to <i>use it</i> to find the location of the Well of Souls. <br/><br/>But we can't "fail forward" endlessly, we must be fumbling towards ecstasy until we reach our climax or run out of oomph. That is to say: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finite resources and the definitive end state</span> (best band name EVER!). Have we gathered all the info we need? Do we reach the princess in time? How do we know?<br/><br/>Now, I could site the usual suspects: in-game time (dragons only feed at night); out-game time (Folks, let's wrap this up by 10 PM); character death (hit points); supplies (rations, light source, last slice of pizza). All these and more can spell our failure. But they are either self-imposed limits or very specific to the challenges we have created for ourselves. And one of the questions in this thread was: what stakes matter? To say, at this point, the stakes are situation specific seems like a bit of a cop-out.<br/><br/>However, the technique suggests its own self-imposed limit. How many meaningful encounters can you have before the story ends - for good or bad. <br/><br/>We might say that we will have a maximum of 7 meaningful encounters in this adventure and 3 of them must result in direct progress (rather than fail forward) to reach the climax. We have 7 tries at bat and 3 of them must be homers. Or each player has two Destiny chips to indicate/establish that this is a meaningful encounter; four of them have to be successful.<br/><br/>Note again that this is system agnostic. We could use D&amp;D 4e to resolve encounters or sit down right now with nothing more than a coin and some character concepts. <br/><br/>I haven't addressed the "moving goal post" yet. What if it emerges from the fiction that  the adventure isn't really about saving the princess from the dragon; does that mean the info we gained on the dragon is meaningless and undermines all of this?  What if there is no clear goal to start with? What if I just pulled a coin out of my pocket and said to you: "You're sitting in a tavern... oh, you're going to need these 7 pieces of napkin I just tore up. You'll see why shortly"<br/><br/>But I've gone on too long in one post. I know it's not for everyone. We all have to determine for ourselves what matters.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427489/#Comment_427489" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-20T23:29:19+00:00" title="January 20, 2014 11:29PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2014 11:30PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that sounds cool on its own merits, <a href="/forums/profile/biffboff">@biffboff</a>, but I'm more interested in <i>answering</i> the question "how to focus on what's important?" than in dodging it by making everything-you-notice be important.\n<blockquote>why are there hieroglyphics if they're unimportant to the game?</blockquote>I think there are several possible answers:<br/>A) Color.

But without context, as a pushable button, no detail will have any meaning in a game sense. Just a succession of dice rolls and outcomes, ad infinitum. <br/><br/>First of all, let's put the hieroglyphs somewhere. In a tomb.<br/><br/>dusty stone tomb, single entrance, south wall<br/>flaking gilded crypt, iron, locked<br/>raised hieroglyphs on the walls<br/>four empty torch sconces, two on east, two on west wall<br/>stone statue, east wall, man with bird head, gilded disc held above head<br/>painted urns, various sizes up to four feet high<br/><br/> "GM and player follow each others interests in the fiction, with the characters opening doors onto unprepared areas of the map, and the GM sprinkling the setting with eye-catching people, places and things. Play includes purposeful missions with time pressure, but it also includes opportunities to enter strange marketplaces, follow will-o-the-wisps, debate each others religions, whittle talismans, or to reject all that and grab a new mission."<br/><br/>You presuppose that the GM provides the details. That's cool. But the method of choosing details might have an effect on meaning. Let's not go down that rabbit hole just yet. There's also no assumption of an over-arching story. Also relevant.<br/><br/>So, the party is in this tomb. Why? What brought them here? If the party has no purpose, nothing here matters. Or to quote myself:<br/>"Well, what are we doing? What's the Adventure? What's the goal? By definition, the hieroglyphics must matter to the goal or they are merely interesting, not meaningful. "<br/><br/>Let's assume the easiest motivation: loot! And where's the loot in this tomb? Gotta be in the crypt (actually, it doesn't <i>have</i> to be; the joy of the GM and players as think-tank means that interesting alternatives are suggested all the time). But let's follow the path of least resistance. How do we open the tomb? The most obvious source of info is the much-talked-about hieroglyphs. Again, it could have been the statue, wall sconces, urns - probably all will be poked at to see if anything <i>interesting</i> pops out. But the hieroglyphs are <i>focused on as a relevant to the task at hand</i>. Therefor, they are <i>meaningful</i>, they must, absolutely <i>must</i> contain info on how to open the crypt or Gm/Player trust is broken. At this point you would usually engage with the mechanics of the system. As discussed, even a failure must fail forward. Perhaps the only useful thing that can be made out is the mention of a deity holding the sun up high. Statue! Now the statue <i>must</i> be relevant.<br/><br/>At this point I would mention stakes and hit points as the most obvious choice and things in a tomb that can cause Hit point damage such as traps, animated statues, undead (in crypts or urns) - but the point is pretty simple: why are the characters here? What is their purpose? Without <i>purpose</i>, there is no <i>meaning</i>. If we can't agree on that, then we're just butting heads and I'll bow out gracefully.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427506/#Comment_427506" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T08:58:38+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  8:58AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally agree with decision identification being an issue.  I recall one 3.5e D&amp;D campaign where we were confronted by an especially dangerous, trapped bridge suspended over a pit with a hidden and seemingly deadly monster in it.<br/><br/>Two character deaths later, I realized that we were a short walk from a mining town with huge unemployment levels. The gold in our pockets would have been sufficient to just tunnel around the challenge.  Having just read a book about plundering the pyramids, I was all fired up about this and thought it would be great fun.<br/><br/>The group wasn't fond of the idea, the DM least of all, and so we ended up chewing over how to get across for some time.  The DM was looking more exasperated as the clock ticked on - it turns out that the traps were exhausted and the monster wasn't that tough, despite appearances.  In the end, our strongest fighter just jumped into the pit and one-shotted it.  It wasn't the brutal choke point it appeared to be, but a bog-standard CR-appropriate room (boo) and some unlucky rolls.<br/><br/>I think problems of this sort are inherent in organic/improvised play: we see only a movie-length glimpse of the characters' lives, but we hope to achieve highlight reel quality, but without being overly contrived in getting there.  Over and under-preparing are bound to happen.<br/><br/>One of the things I was musing on a few months ago was mismatches between player and GM expectations about where the story "ingredients" come from (a charged situation, conflicting goals, etc.).  When the GM and players each expect to do most of the providing themselves, you get a GM who wonders why the players are ignoring all of his plot hooks.  When the players overestimate the GM's contribution, they start following red herrings (possibly feeling like they wasted their time) rather than initiate something they truly care about.\n<blockquote><i><b>Why did we spend so long studying the hieroglyphs?</b><br/>My character's into ancient lore.  This stuff excites him more than most treasures!<br/>The way the GM described it, I thought it seemed important.<br/>I wanted to see if my plan for it would work, because if so, that would have been awesome!<br/>Everyone else was into it, so I tried to come up with a way to use the damn thing.<br/>Your guy was obsessing and I was enjoying teasing him.<br/><b>Okay, but was it worth it?</b><br/>No.  I wanted to make more progress tonight.<br/>No.  I wanted more drama and action tonight.<br/>No.  After all that, the hieroglyphs didn't matter.<br/>No.  After all that, we still don't even know if the hieroglyphs matter.</i></blockquote>\nReading your examples, I was struck by how several of them seem to stem from the players' advocating too little for their own interests. This is one reason why I like BW beliefs (or flags in general); at least at a campaign level, they give the GM clear guidance on what the players are interested in.  (Assuming the players write them well.)<br/><br/>The "Read a Situation" question, "What should I be on the lookout for?" strikes me as the GM's side beliefs - the players get to ask the GM directly what he or she cares about.<br/><br/>While I'm at it, "Make stuff useful" seems like the complement of player-side "Clue-following".  The players show interest in something, so the GM tweaks the world to add weight to it.  In clue-following, when the players sense something with some weight to it, they tweak their characters' motivations to be interested in it.<br/><br/>Huh, that's interesting - I might label these two pairs of behaviors as 'explicit' and 'synergistic'.  (Ignoring offers and outright rejecting offers would be the dark twins to these two, I suppose.)<br/><br/>One of the factors that adds weight to decision misidentification is having high standards.  I can get tied up in knots about trying to have the perfect BW session, or applying a critical eye to the choices we made while playing Fiasco.  Recently, we started a Tremulus game, and from the start I decided to play.. almost lazily, just characterizing my guy and not really worrying about how it fit into the bigger picture, riffing on the events of the game, making potato salad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427507/#Comment_427507" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T09:32:23+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  9:32AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm with <a href="/forums/profile/biffboff">@biffboff</a> : most of the games I play that avoid these problems, irrespective of the specific mechanical techniques in play, simply imbue the players with a clear sense of purpose.<br/><br/>And usually something beyond mere "loot!" is helpful as a motivator, although even that is better than nothing.

I mean, the verbal-level conversation is structurally the same (player asks about some element in the environment, GM responds, <i>which maps onto</i> character examines some aspect of the environment, environment is legible) but there's an additional meta-level component that players can attend to that helps them make sense of their own play. I think this both (a) happens more often than we acknowledge (i.e., voice is for the fiction, gesture is for the mechanics), and (b) could be worth systematizing more frequently than it is (<i>Puppetland</i>, anyone?), particularly in immersion-focused games.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427511/#Comment_427511" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T12:25:37+00:00" title="January 21, 2014 12:25PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, this is cool.<br/><br/>I think I've done this myself on a number of occasions (I haven't played games without a clear sense of purpose, as Matt describes, for a while), and it works pretty well.

If every participant is watching every other participant for signs of what they're interested in and is responsible for also expressing interest in that thing (sometimes genuine, sometimes faking it because that's what they think the other players need) then you've essentially got a bunch of amplifiers hooked up in a way that's especially prone to distortion and feedback (of the "screechy sound when a microphone picks up speaker output" variety). One of the things Vincent Baker has been saying lately is that in AW he wants the GM to be inserting content that's <i>interesting to the GM</i> not that the GM hopes will be interesting to the players. I think games with structure can do this well, especially if they hook flags into the process. For example, in <i>Mouse Guard</i>, it's a fun creative challenge to weave the patrol's Beliefs, Instincts, friends, enemies, etc., into a mission. When I do it I'm not necessarily thinking "player A will love this", it's more like "Ooh, seeing Belief X on character A's sheet gives me the idea to create situation M; I wonder how player A will react when they encounter it". But games with structure are specifically what you don't want, so it's tough for me to engage with the topic since I don't find structure aversive and it's tough for me to put myself in the shoes of someone who does.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427521/#Comment_427521" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T16:50:43+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  4:50PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I think perhaps "unstructured" is the real problem here.

We were reminiscing about our long campaign games where I as GM presented worlds full of mysteries and secrets, some useful, some just color.  John really wants to play again, and when I asked him what he was eager to do with his characters, he gave a long and enthusiastic list that amounted to "find stuff out".  I asked him what he'd do once he found stuff out, and his answer was that he'd use his knowledge to change the world in subtle but ongoing ways.  I told him these might take decades to bear fruit and might not see play, and he didn't mind at all.  The fun of exploration and discovery was his biggest incentive.<br/><br/>John is not, by disposition, a fact-accumulator.  He doesn't value trivia that much, especially not trivia about a fictional world.  The thing that makes discovery fun for him is that, in my game, it's interactive.  Any knowledge John gains is basically fodder for his imagination, about what he might do with his character now, or a little later, or years down the road.  Many of these he never acts on, but the assembling of puzzle pieces into cool new options for character direction always excites him.  And the ones he <i>does</i> act on are particularly rewarding.<br/><br/>The play style I've described in this thread isn't <i>specifically</i> about making John happy, but I think it's important that "I want to know about this just because" be respected as a legitimate thing to do with game time.  Within limits!  That's the key -- not zero, but not too much either.  Accordingly, imbuing players with a sense of purpose is not, in itself, a solution.  If the purpose dictates every decision, then John can't have his fun.  If the purpose is flexible enough to allow John to poke at hieroglyphs, then maybe it's flexible enough to allow him to poke too long.<br/><br/>With an eye toward finding a middle ground, here's an idea:<br/><br/><b>Start with an ample pile of chips in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Whenever a player asks the GM a question, pass the GM a chip from the pile.<br/><br/>Whenever a player proposes a course of action, pass the GM a chip from the pile.<br/><br/>Whenever a player asks or proposes (as above), the GM has the option to spend X chips to escalate time pressure.<br/><br/>Escalation means advancing one increment along this scale:<br/></b>No time pressure.<br/>Source of time pressure announced.<br/>Opportunity for easy escape lost.<br/>Small remote costs -- loss of minor resources or something else valued.<br/>The threat/disaster reaches you.<b><br/><br/>The value of X is set at the beginning of the session.  A value of 2-5 means the group wants a fast-paced session.  A value of 6-12 means they want a more leisurely one.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427524/#Comment_427524" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T17:54:07+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  5:54PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2014 7:46PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">@Fuseboy</a>, I'm totally with you, some sort of player-GM teamwork of taking interest in each other's stuff is extremely helpful.  But I also agree with <a href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">@DanMaruschak</a> that it's not super reliable, and makes a lousy last line of defense.<br/><br/>I'm curious, why didn't your group want to tunnel around the challenge?  That's exactly the sort of creative problem-solving that makes me want to play flexible RPGs as opposed to board games or video games.  If I'd been the GM, regardless of the monster's actual threat level, I would have been quite enthused.<br/><br/>...unless there was something beyond the bridge that your group was eager to get to <i>quickly</i>.  I can certainly remember times in my groups where we were all psyched to do a certain something, and then obstacles which delayed that something were met with much less enthusiasm than other obstacles.  (This is partly why I like improv GMing -- if the players just battled through a super-satisfying fight, that's a good time to give them the loot; being beholden to a map that says, "No, there's another fight," can be less fun.)\n<blockquote>My group now is used to notice by my tone/gestures that when they ask about something meant to be color, and the answer is more color, that clues/loot/etc. for the next challenge lay elsewhere.</blockquote>I could see this being a useful component of a system.  If "give them more color" is an explicit option, used intentionally, then it forces the GM to make a decision about the improvised content -- is it useful, or is it color?  Supposing this decision is made at the right time, this sounds like a good thing to me.  Too late, and it doesn't save any time-wasting.  Too early, and it precludes the possibility of players <i>inventing</i> utility.  <br/><br/>I'm curious: since you've been using this technique, have your players ever surprised you by doing something like Fuseboy's tunneling?\n<blockquote>I think this both (a) happens more often than we acknowledge (i.e., voice is for the fiction, gesture is for the mechanics), and (b) could be worth systematizing more frequently than it is (<i>Puppetland</i>, anyone?), particularly in immersion-focused games.</blockquote>If it could be made sticky and button-pushy enough to engender consistent use, I would <i>love</i> this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427525/#Comment_427525" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T18:27:03+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  6:27PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> It's just a mismatch of play styles. We were playing through a Paizo adventure path, so going 'off module' seemed to give the GM some level of discomfort. The play group was largely a 'kick in the door' type party - they weren't interested much in tactics. Frankly I think they were probably more in alignment with the game than I was - my wanting to go and hire miners might have been a small sort of rebellion.  (Though, in the end, our failure to cover the bases by coordinating our party roles left us with a lethal liability later on; some fear-causing undead left us in shambles, and then a single mind flayer TPK'd the party with mind control.)<br/><br/>Your system looks really interesting. It makes me think of Dirty Dungeons, except instead of a prep-time activity, it's right in the heart of play.<br/><br/>What does "propose a course of action" mean?  Is that when a player says, "I open the chest"?  Or is it when a player says, in character, "You know, we should go west to avoid the lizards."<br/><br/>If three players are deciding what to do, and they each propose a course of action, does that give the GM three chips?  This is pretty brilliant, because it gives the GM ammo precisely when the players are feeling that the thing they're planning for is a big deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427530/#Comment_427530" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T22:34:53+00:00" title="January 21, 2014 10:34PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, that's a really cool idea.

I guess that for players it doesn't matter much if it's a dead end, if they can have fun making graffiti on that wall, or even chip a piece from it to use it as a weapon.<br/><br/>I recall a recent PF session where our GM used a lot of places carved with antimagic runes to stop magic users to circumvent a challenge. Also, it made sense for the places to have anti.magic defenses. Well, there were enough runes carved that it made useless to destroy one to lift the protection, so that was obviously a dead end. But then I had my monk pull out a crowbar from his backpack, pry out a single brick with a rune and use it later to dispell a trap portal. Our GM used the same technique, so I'd safely say that<i> there's no actual way to stop players imagination</i>. Which in the end, it's also a good thing if as a GM, you learn to react to it in a positive way, build on it, enlist the players to help you build the fiction and/or cast enough illusions/red herrings/good hooks to distract them.<br/><br/>Edit: I'm definitely adding the time resource trick to the old school game I'm working on next. I was thinking of making light sources = time, so the longer the characters discuss/plan anything, the less light time they have.

It's got a very simple set up with some monster attacks disturbing a newly-minted mining operation. One of the characters is an Adventurer with several Wises, including Tunnel-wise and Loot-wise, the use of which have read to some really fun twists. My prep is minimal enough that these interesting new directions didn't disrupt anything, but robust enough that I would've felt confident disallowing anything that would've taken the game in a really zany or otherwise inappropriate direction.<br/><br/>And one of the things I love about BW is that you can tweak players' ability to make stuff worthwhile in several ways. First off, you can give the player with the most interest in that stuff the Adventurer or similar character with several Wises. Secondly, if the GM *does* have something specific in mind as an answer to a question, you don't have to allow the player to narrate the facts\u2014it's perfectly fine to make accurate, uncomplicated correct information the result of a success. And you even do have things happen that aren't necessarily relevant to "the group's exact purpose right this second" but that can come up later if people are interested.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427569/#Comment_427569" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-22T15:11:00+00:00" title="January 22, 2014  3:11PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, remind me, if I find Loot and roll well on Loot-Wise, and the GM lets me narrate, what stops me from declaring that this Loot is Alzambra's Goggles of Insta-Kill and that I, being versed in Alzambrian lore, know the password to activate them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427570/#Comment_427570" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-22T15:17:42+00:00" title="January 22, 2014  3:17PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, as I understand it, the procedure for wises is:<br/>1.

It certainly is in my experience. If that process of discernment starts to feel like a waste of time or source of frustration the problem is most likely the balance of the difficulty of interpreting importance and the feedback players get when they try to spend their time investigating the fiction. <br/><br/>On one hand if identifying significance or utility is too random or difficult the experience will be unpleasant, leading to frustration behaviors. On the other, if significance or utility is too simple or automatic the entire endeavor will become boring and relegated to an automatic process - losing the organic delving into a self-consistent fictional world. <br/><br/>To my mind, the solution is to look at how the GM's actions teach players to identify significance and utility, how the GM can provide clearer feedback and how the difficulty of identification can increase to keep pace with the techniques and strategies players have learned. This is much harder than borrowing the iconography of video games in quest flags and outlined objects to interact with. If part of the fun of these kinds of games is to figure out how to make something that seems interesting into something that is useful, it is a shame to throw that baby out with the bathwater.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427586/#Comment_427586" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-23T08:09:56+00:00" title="January 23, 2014  8:09AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, I would point out that if John is interested in the Hieroglyphics for their own sake, then there is no problem with exploring them for their own sake. If there's no problem then there is no need to apply a specific solution. But it <i>can</i> become a problem if<br/>A: the other Players are getting restless. In which case: "That 's all the Hieroglyphics say. There is no more". No problem.<br/>B:John continues to poke at the played-out Hieroglyphics hoping for something more. But what?<br/><br/>The GM isn't a mind reader; the Players should, by default without prompting, state the <i>intent</i> behind their actions. What is it you hope to find? If the Player isn't <i>giving</i> you anything then say: "you find nothing" and move on to another Player. If this isn't a clear "in-game conversation" indicator, then perhaps you do need something more overt - pick up or put down your dice, raise an eye-brow, whatever.<br/><br/>There's also an underlying assumption creeping into the topic that the GM has <i>decided</i> the Hieroglyphics aren't important. That's a form of prepped play. Whether the GM decided that seconds or weeks ago, it's hidden info that the Player's must now guess.<br/><br/>If that's your style, cool. The Hieroglyphics are important only if you say they are. Now the shoe is on the other foot. The Player's aren't mind readers. State your intent. If the characters can interact with your setting in meaningful ways, then your setting should <i>interact</i> with the characters. Otherwise it is passive and mute and the Players can only fumble around hoping to guess.<br/><br/>In hard-boiled OSR, dropping hints is weak-sauce. But if you want the Adventure to be where the Adventurers are (or at least nearby), have a character notice a reflection of a Hieroglyphic in the statue's gold disc; have a sprinkle of dust fall on the Urns. Tell the Players up-front that the setting <i>will</i> talk to you IF you listen. <br/><br/>You can use it as a last resort to move things forward. You can even give it a cost; whether a token system or simply indicating that the mechanics of the game are probably going to kick in soon - pick up your dice, this might sting a little.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427602/#Comment_427602" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-23T13:51:26+00:00" title="January 23, 2014  1:51PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2014 1:51PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt &amp; Fuse, so I guess the key technology for BW Wises in this case is a "wouldn't it be cool if" button for the players to push.  You engage it because it might get you something cool, but once you engage it the Obstacle calculation system ensures that you can't just pull epic utility out of nothing.<br/><br/>Supposing the GM does have secret info in mind, I suppose that's inserted immediately after the player proposes a fact, right?  <br/>Player: "Alzambrians used orbs like this in their journeys, so there must be a way to detach and carry this thing!"<br/>GM: "No, actually, the orb won't move, but there <i>is</i> something <i>else</i> about it else about it you might realize.  Ob 3."<br/><br/>Then once the dice are rolled, I suppose it's always possible for the GM to be more or less generous -- "Wow, 10 successes?  You know what, you <i>can</i> detach this thing." -- and then the orb-probing is <i>over</i>.  Right?<br/><br/>The tidiness here is very appealing.  I'm just not sure how comfortable I am with "roll once and move on".  It's a great way to avoid over-analysis, but what if another player then has a great idea?  What if someone wants to try an experiment, which requires no prior knowledge?  The Wise roll outcome hasn't adjusted the fiction in any way to obviate these; all we really have is a "roll once and move on" social contract, and I can't imagine that any of my hieroglyph-studiers would want to sign it.<br/><br/>What would happen if players were given, say, unlimited Physics-wise rolls for an object they're looking to do something clever with?  We still get the useful directive that the players must have an objective in mind in order to roll.  We still get the likelihood analysis, in the form of Ob calculation.  Is that enough?  Or does the option to say "that didn't work; lets try something else" completely defeat the waste-saving element?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427603/#Comment_427603" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-23T13:53:28+00:00" title="January 23, 2014  1:53PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel, nice, I like your way of putting it.

Perhaps those should be distinguished from each other, with different procedures employed for each.<br/><br/>I don't know if that's possible, though, and here's why: I've actually GMed a lot where I had decided <i>something</i> about some setting feature, but not <i>everything</i>.  So the conversation could go either way, depending on the players' ideas.<br/><br/>In maintaining the illusion of the fictional world as a real place with its own consistent, internal causality, the conversations <i>looked</i> identical from the players' end -- the characters are poking at a neat object, testing and guessing and reasoning what use they might get out of it.  "What the GM has already decided" isn't visible as such anywhere in the equation.  I'd rather not ditch that if at all possible.<br/><br/>GM-side mechanics would be great here, but again, I'm stumped on "bang for your buck" incentives.                        </div>\n<div

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Matt &amp; Fuse, so I guess the key technology for BW Wises in this case is a "wouldn't it be cool if" button for the players to push.  You engage it because it might get you something cool, but once you engage it the Obstacle calculation system ensures that you can't just pull epic utility out of nothing.</blockquote>\nThat's exactly right.\n<blockquote>Supposing the GM does have secret info in mind, I suppose that's inserted immediately after the player proposes a fact, right?  <br/>Player: "Alzambrians used orbs like this in their journeys, so there must be a way to detach and carry this thing!"<br/>GM: "No, actually, the orb won't move, but there <i>is</i> something <i>else</i> about it else about it you might realize.  Ob 3."</blockquote>\nI'm not sure what the canonical process is here; I've often done something like that, or modified the proposed fact.  "Well, in Svartleton the monks all do their own laundry, but there are all manner of other servants that come and go, yes."<br/><br/>Just to be clear, wises are explicitly knowledge skills.  They are used to reveal (to the players and GM) what the PC knows; if a player is looking for food in a room, that's a Scavenging test, not Food-wise (though it could provide a bonus die, on the grounds that it helps narrow the search and so on).<br/><br/>The only real exception to this is Circles, which represents your social connectedness. A circles test often does quite a lot - it can establish that a given NPC exists, but also often does the work of getting in touch (going across town and making the appointment, or petitioning via letters).<br/><br/>The way I see wises and circles is that it's a way to tap into player creativity while still giving the GM full authority over what's true in the game world. I notice that in games that don't have it, players use an informal version of the same thing, asking leading questions that prompt the GM to make something up.<br/><br/>"Do I know anything about this sort of artwork?"<br/>"Do I happen to know any of the other mercenaries in this tavern from my time in the watch?"\n<blockquote>Then once the dice are rolled, I suppose it's always possible for the GM to be more or less generous -- "Wow, 10 successes?  You know what, you <i>can</i> detach this thing." -- and then the orb-probing is <i>over</i>.  Right?</blockquote>\nStrictly speaking, wise rolls don't use margin of success (only a very few things do), though it's true my groups have often colored success with an extra flourish on runaway successes.  I'd be leery of making it have a really meaningful extra effect, though, simply because that dilutes the risk you take in going for high-Ob knowledge. Why not just go for something vague and easy, and grouse for juicy dirt if you make it by a lot.  Though some tests are like that explicitly, so this point needn't be overstressed.\n<blockquote>The tidiness here is very appealing.  I'm just not sure how comfortable I am with "roll once and move on".  It's a great way to avoid over-analysis, but what if another player then has a great idea?  What if someone wants to try an experiment, which requires no prior knowledge?  The Wise roll outcome hasn't adjusted the fiction in any way to obviate these; all we really have is a "roll once and move on" social contract, and I can't imagine that any of my hieroglyph-studiers would want to sign it.<br/><br/>What would happen if players were given, say, unlimited Physics-wise rolls for an object they're looking to do something clever with?  We still get the useful directive that the players must have an objective in mind in order to roll.  We still get the likelihood analysis, in the form of Ob calculation.  Is that enough?  Or does the option to say "that didn't work; lets try something else" completely defeat the waste-saving element?</blockquote>\nLet it Ride prevents you from re-rolling for the same intent, but if the situation or intent changes materially, then you can try again.  Also, there's a lot of encouragement to make failure consequential in BW.<br/><br/>Failed circles and wises are really interesting: it could be that you <i>were</i> right, but the situation has changed. Maybe there is a rope bridge where you remember it, but it's nearly rotted out.  Maybe you do know a mercenary here, but the cultists got to him first.  (Han's decision to go to Cloud City is a perfect example of a Circles test, IMO.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427619/#Comment_427619" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-24T08:18:09+00:00" title="January 24, 2014  8:18AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With an ever-narrowing set of criteria, the problem begins to mirror that of mystery games: specifically, how do you reveal clues (hidden info) to the party and how do you curtail red herrings (cut-short the fruitless explorations of  dead-ends) as opposed to situations where you are more open to player input/solutions.

It's a rare but occasionally potent option.<br/><br/>BW's methodology definitely addresses the "thought up some stuff, but not everything" issue.<br/><br/>The only other thing I'd add, that's (very) important:<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Player: "Alzambrians used orbs like this in their journeys, so there must be a way to detach and carry this thing!"<br/>GM: "No, actually, the orb won't move, but there is something else about it else about it you might realize. Ob 3."&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>Remember that the GM always has to set a consequence for failing the roll. This is another major way to keep play moving. Consequences for failure don't have to always be catastrophic, of course.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427622/#Comment_427622" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-24T08:26:45+00:00" title="January 24, 2014  8:26AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops, x-posted. :-)<br/><br/>Anyway, I've been thinking about this speech from <i>Inherit the Wind</i>:<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, progress has never been a bargain. You've got to pay for it. Sometimes I think there's a man behind a counter who says, 'All right, you can have a telephone; but you'll have to give up privacy, the charm of distance. Madam, you may vote; but at a price; you lose the right to retreat behind a powderpuff or a petticoat. Mister, you may conquer the air; but the birds will lose their wonder, and the clouds will smell of gasoline!' Darwin moved us forward to a hilltop, where we could look back and see the way from which we came. But for this view, this insight, this knowledge, we must abandon our faith in the pleasant poetry of Genesis."<br/><br/>I think everything in RPG design involves tradeoffs. If you improve clarity about what is and isn't important, you damage the illusion of an objectively pre-extant setting. If you improve fairness in adjudication, you may reduce improvisational affordance. If you improve the game's focus, you reduce the likelihood of random side issues organically becoming prominent (though actually this happens a lot in long-term BW play). If you make fictional positioning genuinely important, you increase the reliance on honest adjudication.<br/><br/>At some point, you have to just decide where your priorities are.

Anyway, in Ingenero, the game is structured - precisely around Dave's central point.  In Ingenero, players officially set concrete goals for their characters, and play alternates between periods when nothing is happening that will directly affect the outcomes of those goals (story phase), and those periods where someone's goal is on the line (challenge phase).  In story phase you focus on decisions characters make and in challenge phase you roll dice and focus on achievement.<br/><br/>The central thing is the differentiation between activities that are closely related to <i>character goals</i> and those that arent.  You can obviously play this way in an unstructured fashion without official character goals or phases of play, and Im sure many groups do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427642/#Comment_427642" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-25T06:09:43+00:00" title="January 25, 2014  6:09AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>It sounds like you might be barking up a good tree.

It's meant to help GMs come up with material on the spot, instead of going for a magician's choice or plain blocking the road.<br/><br/>Yet, point taken; would it make it any better if this was rolled openly, or if players could spend some kind of resource to take control of the fiction and suggest a different background for the aforementioned hieroglyphs?<br/><br/>Say, yesterday I had the chance to test more fully a mechanic I designed for my current campaign. In this occasion given the game characteristics, I figured that PCs might end up separated and even confronting each other, so I made up a mechanic to give players something to do whenever their PCs weren't on scene. It's a set of cards with tasks for the players; they draw one randomly and if they can accomplish whatever it has written in a way that makes the scene better, they are rewarded with game currency (action points in this case)<br/><br/>I'm still working on this, but so far it has made wonders for the session. At some points it allowed me to take the back seat and watch players create a lot of the scene by their own, and I'm talking here about players who aren't exactly active story-gamers but more trad-like ones.

The goal is to efficiently get to the point where the players do or do not enact the plan.<br/><br/>"Plan will work" is just bad phrasing on my part.  Form Plan is an assessment, not an augury.  If rolls are involved later on, make them.  If your plan is "kill the guards, then sneak in", and you roll well on Form Plan, all it means is that <i>if</i> you kill the guards (who seem killable) you will indeed have the <i>opportunity</i> to sneak (into a place that seems sneakable).  It doesn't predict whether you'll roll critical hits or misses on your combat or sneak rolls.  "Plan will work, given successful execution, the odds of which are apparent" is what I really meant.<br/><br/>Rolling Form Plan just means you don't need to waste time going, "If we kill the guards, there might just be more guards, or a lookout tower, or alarms, and we <i>still</i> won't have a chance to sneak in."  It forestalls the endless need to cover every base and hatch a billion plans to compare against each other.<br/><br/>Let's see if this language is any better:\n<p><b>Form Plan:</b> GM secretly rolls 1d8.

And god damn we hate the Prince, she is just too good looking, and she doesn't like my begonias enough. "Hey, let's kill her!" *high fives all around*.  So we form a three step plan: kill her spies so she doesn't know the danger, bribe the Sheriff to pretend it was all a big accident, throw molotovs into her limo.  (Maybe the GM is inwardly cringing because she thought the Prince said your begonias were way more awesome than they really were, and like the hieroglyphics on the wall in the dungeon, your outrage is leading you down a sudden, unexpected path.)<br/><br/>Now, we, the players, are trying to assess whether this is a feasible plan or not, shouldn't we be doing things like "using the social interaction system to talk to our cool-haircut friends who might know who the spies are" or "using the Background system to talk to my vampire mom; remember when she made out with the Sheriff that one time?"  or "use the stealth system to sneak around in the Prince's garage and check out her limo to see if it's molotov proof or whatever"  <br/><br/>Or maybe we roll like shit, didn't develop these resources or don't have any of these ideas, isn't this our own shitty/unlucky play and isn't it absolutely okay under the circumstances for us to ram our face into whichever fictional wall that we were too stupid/unlucky/cursed by God/good-looking to spot?  <br/><br/>Or is that what you're talking about?  In Vampire: the Masquerade are our Politics Skill, Mentor Background and Stealth Skills the equivalent of "Form Plan" in whatever system you're writing about. Apocalypse World or something? <br/><br/>(But in Apocalypse World you don't form plans, you do shit. Forming plans really doesn't do anything for you in Apocalypse World.)<br/><br/>(PS Similarly to investigating the hieroglyphics in D&amp;D, I kinda feel like the equivalent to "make the hieroglyphics matter" for this scenario would be to think for ten seconds, then say "Two nights later you are standing over the Prince's ashes as the remains of her limo blaze angrily away in the street. Roll your Humanity, then roll for fear frenzy for the fire."

They've already solved the problem of decision identification.  They made a decision!<br/><br/>Form Plan is more for the group who comes up with your 3-step plan and then spends an hour refining or second-guessing it. Or, well, if they do that and <i>love</i> it, then they don't need Form Plan either.  But if they obsess and then wind up regretting it, Form Plan might help.<br/><br/>I remember a Werewolf game where we crept down into this oddly shaped hole, and my character had thought to bring explosives with him, and we spent a fair amount of time pondering whether it was wise and/or feasible for me to rig the place to collapse.  We got to an answer eventually, but the conversation was pretty inefficient, as we got hung up on minutiae instead of getting directly to the point of "Will it collapse or not, and can we tell?"  So the Form Plan procedure is intended to expedite this.<br/><br/>We don't even need to roll every time.  The trigger I first wrote (which I should have included in the revisions) says "player states their plan, GM says "yes" or "no" if it's obvious whether or not the plan will work".  So if, on a given occasion, the only thing Form Plan does is remind the GM to look at the bottom line and recall that there's no way in hell the Sheriff would go along with this, that's a win.<br/><br/>Maybe I should change the phrasing to "player states a plan they're pondering but not yet committed to".  If they're ready to act, there's no need to bother with Form Plan.<br/><br/>I'm not totally sold on this idea, mind you.  This is just where I <i>hope</i> it'd add value.  I still need to think about how much player cleverness is undercut, and whether that's worth it in the sort of group that'd be inclined to do tons of strategizing in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427748/#Comment_427748" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-28T23:42:32+00:00" title="January 28, 2014 11:42PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2014 11:43PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            accidental post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427755/#Comment_427755" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T06:39:12+00:00" title="January 29, 2014  6:39AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I remember a Werewolf game where we crept down into this oddly shaped hole, and my character had thought to bring explosives with him, and we spent a fair amount of time pondering whether it was wise and/or feasible for me to rig the place to collapse.

If the plan makes sense to the players I'm comfortable with using the plan to guide the game. Mostly I think the biggest issue with planning in action games is that you often end up sitting down to play Mission: Impossible and end up in Twelve Angry Men. That's not to say that you COULDN'T make a game about the planning process, just that a game about planning to do things would be fundamentally different than a game about doing things. <br/><br/>I've gotten to heavily favoring In Media Res beginnings to action games and then allowing the players to retroactively define the elements of their plan either through a resource (Edge, Fate Points, Hero Points), a background element (Because Lander is tight with the local elven gang lord he knew about the security riggers BTL habit and can just waltz into the lobby after slipping him a really hot Maria Mercurial bootleg) or through Character skill/knowledge (Because Nitro the Company Man has "Security Procedures 6" he totally remembered to bring the wire clippers). I wouldn't do that if my players WANTED to spend a few hours planning in meticulous detail the assault on Mount Deadly (and yes it would be totally innapropriate for an OSR game), but the things that my players say they want and seem to enjoy is better served by just assuming that the CHARACTERS have come up with a good plan and the players are their for the exciting parts of the movie. Essentially I let the character's abilities and backgrounds give the Players some narrative control over the universe even in a "trad game". <br/><br/>Just my 2 Cents.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427764/#Comment_427764" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T13:35:24+00:00" title="January 29, 2014  1:35PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2014 1:52PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crunch, I dig that game and would play it with you in a second.  But that's <i>totally</i> different than what I'm talking about in this thread.  I'm talking about planning that's born of a desire to tackle a challenge that <i>demands some skill</i>.  Where, y'know, the players have specific constraints (in this case, fictional particulars), and if they don't navigate them skillfully, they suffer the consequences.  In this play style, trying to come up with a good plan <i>is</i> fun, and important -- I just think it's often inefficient and occasionally unnecessary, so that's what I'm trying to work on here.<br/><br/><i>When is it necessary?<br/><br/>When it's necessary, how do we form the best plan we can, or close enough, without taking forever?</i><br/><br/>I'm not sure if my latest proposals answer that, but that's what I'm attempting.\n<blockquote>Ah ha, so for example in this situation instead of a random roll it might have been better for there to be a GM directive somewhere that said "if they seem to be getting hung up on minutia of a plan and they don't seem to be liking it, boil down their uncertainty to a single question and how they want to answer it, if it's about a person, check out the Empathy skill (etc. etc.)"</blockquote>It might have been better for the GM to actually <i>do</i> that, sure.  Whether a "GM directive somewhere" would accomplish that, my experience says "no".  I'm looking for stuff like Die Rolls That Get You Things because people actually use them.  Every time any game has ever bogged down, there's probably <i>some</i> piece of GM advice that was being overlooked.<br/><br/>I'm not saying every die roll in every game actually does get you things, though.  If the output of Form Plan isn't valued, then people won't use it either.  I'm guessing that "now we're ready to proceed"/"now we're ready to abandon this idea" would be valued, but it's just a guess.<br/><br/>Based on your suggestion, here's a different kind of idea:\n<p><b>Identify the Key</b>: when the players get stuck pondering multiple angles of a plan, the GM rolls to determine what is the true key to success or failure.<br/><i>Stage:</i><br/>5-6 - final step of plan<br/>3-4 - middle step of plan<br/>1-2 - first step of plan<br/>If that doesn't clarify it, roll again (or simply pick) for <i>Issue type:</i><br/>6 - combat<br/>5 - brute physical task<br/>4 - precision physical task<br/>3 - convince someone<br/>2 - acquire information<br/>1 - timing or luck<br/><br/>GM then identifies the Key to the group, adding information to effectively dismiss other concerns as needed.</p>\nI don't think that works as is -- takes too much of the strategic payoff out of it -- but it might be a starting point for something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427765/#Comment_427765" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T13:48:14+00:00" title="January 29, 2014  1:48PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The struggle is that in the Werewolf: the Apocalypse system, there <i>already are</i> die rolls that get you things - in the case of your demolition question, things like Science or Crafts or whatever.

"Science" could have been any one of those -- knowing the earth is weak, or knowing that these charges will destroy weak earth, or using charges to destroy earth -- and none of us had the Science skill anyway. Plus, it wasn't clear to us how to get our own clever fiction-based strategy into that equation. Difficulty number mods might have worked, except that it often seemed that the GM was pulling those numbers out of his ass.<br/><br/>I'm not saying there was no way to use the tools Werewolf gave us to address this situation. Maybe it's obvious to you. But we were a group of smart dudes with an experienced GM making a good faith effort, and it wasn't obvious to us. We fell back on interrogating the fiction endlessly because it was usually more satisfying. Perhaps a few simple house rules would have changed that, but we never got there. Honestly, though, my guess from your descriptions thus far is that player cleverness wasn't a big deal for your group. If you're content to just be colorful and creative, then roll some dice and see how it shakes out, then there's no risk of getting bogged down in decisions in the first place.<br/><br/>That said, I don't see any problem with factoring character skills into the plan-forming equation, as long as they don't take the place of whatever player skills can be applied.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427768/#Comment_427768" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T15:10:24+00:00" title="January 29, 2014  3:10PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OWoD rules in general could be tricky with stuff like that.

Asking myself "What would be so terrible if the succeed here?" is another big one picked up from dirty-hippy games that I try to use regularly.<br/><br/>In that specific WWtA situation, today, I'd just make a quick judgment call on <i>something</i> to roll, allow any success to give the info, and play on.

If your character lacks the skill or knowledge necessary to plant explosives, there is nothing a player really <i>should</i> be able to do to fake that, right? Otherwise why have character capabilities at all?  Again, isn't the preferred outcome the GM saying, categorically, "you lack the expertise to know the answer to this question; do you proceed under the uncertainty that you're under"?<br/><br/>(There are some game systems I've heard of where player skill does replace character skill - disarming traps at some early D&amp;D tables was the player making incredibly demanding questions of the GM step by step about springs and triggers and such, but I'm not really talking about that here, seems to be a different sort of situation.)<br/><br/>I'm trying to stay away from looseness/casualness of approach as being controlling. "Interrogating the fiction" in a fiction-first game like Werewolf or Apocalypse World takes place through the lens of the game system, or at least it often does, and certainly in situations where you're trying to determine if something is feasible.<br/><br/>I'm curious, in your Werewolf example, did anyone ask the GM, "Hey, does my guy know how to do this at all?" or "What skill would it be to place the charges properly?" Or were you just not interested in the game system at all? If the latter, couldn't there have been a five-page 40-point-type section called "Explosives and how to adjudicate their use" that everyone forgot about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427771/#Comment_427771" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T17:50:11+00:00" title="January 29, 2014  5:50PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would suggest that the root of the problem is probably turtling ( "a gameplay strategy that emphasizes heavy defense"). Players are planning for failure instead of success. Every contingency must be weighed and measured and this takes time. <br/><br/>Establish a little GM/Player trust by telling the party that a successful plan relies on 3 (or 2,4,5 whatever) KEY points. If the goal is to kill the Prince and the plan is to fire-bomb him in his car, then 3 Key points might be; When will he be in his car; what route will he take; how will you stop the car in traffic? Assure them that <i>any</i> reasonable plan that incorporates these points will have a reasonable chance for success. <br/><br/>Also, assure them that if there's a hitch in the plan, they will have an opportunity to try to fix it on the fly - all the best heist stories use this (The Sting, Ocean's Eleven,etc). There's no need, indeed no WAY, to plan for it, so deal with it when it arises. Plan for 3 successes, not an infinity of failures.<br/><br/>A more meta-game variation would call for 3 rolls on a generic table. You might roll Violence/Destruction, Subterfuge, a Technical Skill. Any reasonable plan incorporating those three elements will have a reasonable chance for success. It focuses the plan clearly on what needs to be done, not what might happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427772/#Comment_427772" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T18:47:37+00:00" title="January 29, 2014  6:47PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, <a href="/forums/profile/biffboff">@biffboff</a>, now I understand what the 4E people were thinking when they designed Skill Challenges!

So here's what I was thinking: the key to the roll I proposed is that with enough convincing reasons why it should work (3 on a d6 roll or 4 on a d8 roll), the roll <i>isn't</i> about success or failure.  It's about signalling an end to the conversation.\n<p><b>Form Plan:</b> player states their plan, GM says "yes" or "no" if it's obvious whether or not the plan will work, otherwise says "uncertain" and secretly rolls a d8. For every convincing reason a player can give why the plan should work, add +1 to the roll.<br/>7+ - plan seems solid, no holes, relevant factors accurately accounted for (this is the truth)<br/>5-6 - plan seems uncertain; are we missing something? (in reality, it is solid, as above)<br/>3-4 - plan seems full of holes; key factors are unknown, or odds suck (this is the truth)<br/>1-2 - plan seems uncertain; are we missing something? (in reality, it is full of holes, as above)<br/><br/>GM narrates accordingly.</p>\nMy hope is that the presence of this move, highlighted on a short list of mechanical options, will help the group see their play through the eyes of "are we forming a plan?"  And if they are, the move tells them what to do next:<br/>1) GM tells them what's obvious.<br/>2) Players apply their cleverness to the problem in a directed fashion, aiming for "reasons this would work", tweaking the plan as needed to produce more such reasons.  If they can't come up with any, maybe they abandon the plan and don't even roll.<br/>3) When the players finish tweaking and explaining their plan, the GM sums up the characters' remaining analysis and tasks them with the final decision, indicating that no more new info will be forthcoming.<br/>4) Now the players have to decide whether to act, or move on to another plan.<br/><br/>The other key is that the Gather Data move precedes this, so the flow of 1-4 shouldn't be interrupted by players getting new info and then reconsidering their options.  That may be the single biggest time-wasting habit in this process when it isn't structured -- pondering, then getting more info you could have gotten the first time, then pondering again from scratch.<br/><br/>Perhaps a simpler system would be "if you can think of 4 good reasons why your plan would work, think no more on it, either do it or don't".  But I doubt anyone will remember that without the ritual of the player-GM back-and-forth and the rolling of a die.<br/><br/>P.S. So what are the 1-4 roll results there for?  They're there for when the players aren't in the mood to sweat over a great plan, and are content to hope for luck first.  Some plans just don't deserve the time.  Hopefully this procedure will help players recognize that from time to time, because the GM will tell them the obvious and ask for convincing reasons <i>before</i> they get locked into optimizing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427781/#Comment_427781" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T22:01:54+00:00" title="January 29, 2014 10:01PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How would you like your Players to fail?<br/><br/>Do you want hidden information that the players failed to find out?<br/>Do you want to roll a D6 on the spot and declare the plan a failure?<br/>Do you want to notice a flaw in their plan and reveal it as it's played out?<br/><br/>Perhaps you're reading Key points as "skill checks/dice rolls".

(They may be wrong about this but let them be wrong if it's reasonable).<br/>"What do you need to do to accomplish that?" (hopefully in as few points as possible as long as each point sounds reasonable).<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427782/#Comment_427782" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T23:08:04+00:00" title="January 29, 2014 11:08PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some interesting questions there!

He's a veteran 2E player (dunno if this has anything to do with it or if it's just him) who has the tendency to extend plan discussions eternally and use a lot of metaphors to illustrate his point about what could happen, instead of proposing an action course from the beginning as everyone else. It's probably just the way he is. Anyway, the solution the GM gave was to include a time constraint for planning, either advancing the next scene, event or rolling for a random encounter while we were arguing. Now we focus ourselves better, hurry each other and cut to the point while planning.<br/><br/>Of course, as a GM it means you've gotta be a bit more, let's say, "disrespecful" since you've gotta interrupt the players conversation and start pressing them with one subject or another. Yet in the end it pays, since this actually adds to the game a different feeling of excitement. But of course, players will need to get rewarded for planning on the go in the same measure than for a carefully thought plan that took them ages of game play to come up with. Otherwise, they will step back to discussing plans forever.<br/><br/>Making this a move may work for your group, but it's certainly going to be misread by other groups as an arbitrary way to dismiss their planning, instead of a way to speed it up. Mostly because there are a lot of groups that unlike yours, are already trained to focus in a short timespan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427789/#Comment_427789" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-30T08:16:32+00:00" title="January 30, 2014  8:16AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2e was on a weird cusp of skill systems - endless ratiocination about planning makes more sense in context of skill-less D&amp;D systems; you literally have no other mechanic by which you can be effective if it's not covered by magic or a weapon.  2e had the non-weapon proficiencies, though I never experienced what-Eero-would-call-"principled" use of them, they were always haphazard.

"...and the hieroglyphs stand out from the rest of the decorations" or "and the hieroglyphs look like the usual sort of things for a tomb of this period."<br/><br/>2) To what extent are we talking about player planning, and to what extent character planning. If a character has "Small Unit Tactics 4" should it matter here? What are we doing to the agency of the players if we boil down the planning phase to a simple roll?<br/><br/>I know the answer to this in an OSR context (planning is a player activity. the world is objective so no roll for plan validity is needed, and wasting hours mapping every corridor and planning for how to handle the room is a core activity of the style), and I know both my reaction as a GM (if the players aren't having fun planning then find ways to change that time to time spent doing things they do enjoy) and how I would feel as a player if I spent an hour planning to enter an empty room (bored) or had an hours planning negated because the dice said that the plan wouldn;t work (frustrated).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427793/#Comment_427793" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-30T10:08:49+00:00" title="January 30, 2014 10:08AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that's the point, the difference is that this roll is meant to be made after <b>5 minutes of seeing the players go on and on on a discussion that looks like it's going to take an hour. </b>, not after a few hours of carefully detailed planning. Letting that discussion go on an on is a crime if as a GM, you know it's all about material you haven't prepared. Even worse if this discussion does nothing to inspire you to create an interesting motive/purpose behind those hieroglyphs. So instead of breaking the ilusion completely, openly railroading the players, or presenting a magician's choice, you just see how the discussion goes for 5 minutes, ask a couple of questions to help them define an outline of their plans quickly and roll the dice to obtain some inspiration for a possible outcome.<br/><br/>All the stats/skills that could be rolled to obtain information are just as good as the chances players have to make good rolls in the system used. And then the weight-lifting goes back to the shoulders of the GM, to decide how much information is necessary to keep the plot moving foward, at which point it should be given and if the roll justifies enough it's authenticity and detail. On a bad roll you may get no info, but that's definitely worse than getting unnacurate info, in the sense that no info stalls the flow of the story, where unnacurate info just makes it move in (maybe) an unfavorable way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427794/#Comment_427794" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-30T10:12:19+00:00" title="January 30, 2014 10:12AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2014 10:14AM by biffboff.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In regards to <b>Form Plan</b>, you incorporate player cleverness by +1 modifiers. Won't this exacerbate the problem of over-planning by having the players look for every advantage? Min-maxing isn't just for the Power Gamer but for the Turtle as well. You're back to square one with "Enough already! Just do it!" If you cap the modifier (say, +4 max), won't every Form Plan keep the players planning until they get +4? <br/><br/>However, if you require a plan to scale to the complexity and interest of the problem, you can set a limit that should also scale to the time it takes to formulate. <br/><br/>Crossing hazardous terrain is not a particularly fascinating problem but it comes up from time to time. Set x to 2  "convincing reasons a player can give why the plan should work" before a Form Plan roll can be made.<br/><br/>Destroying the vampire Prince of a city; now <i>that</i> requires some grand scheming - it should take more time and be more interesting, too. Set x to 6 (or whatever).<br/><br/>x will roughly equal the time and thought that a plan requires/deserves. Now roll Form Plan.<br/><br/>I also wonder how you would tell players their "plan seems full of holes" based on a die roll. Won't they immediately ask "How? What's wrong with it?" And won't this also lead to more (or other) planning? Back to square one.<br/><br/>What if your Roll was more about complications that might arise? Things that can't be planned for, such as unexpected guards, faulty equipment, bad timing. Allow a max modifier of +/- 1 for good/bad plans (by your GM estimate) and Roll.

idea]/[adjudicate]/[roll]</blockquote>Yeah, that'd be worthless.  The idea is to instead take a meandering conversation of 30 minutes and turn into a more focused conversation of 10 minutes by sticking to what matters: "Why do you think <i>this plan right here</i> will work?  If you can't answer that, we move on."  Hour-long planning chats inevitably shift between planning, gathering data, and switching plans in a chaotic mess.  Sticking to, "We're committed to this course of action, and here's what we're doing to optimize it," is almost always fun and worth the time in my experience.\n<blockquote>if you're going to have a system in which the planning is A) a major time element and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> largely determinant of success or failure and C) basically mechanical, then you are better off building a social game that's about making plans</blockquote>That sounds like a neat idea, but I'm not sure what you mean.<br/><br/>"Largely determinant of success or failure" is important to me.

For some reason, everyone seems to be hearing "+1 for every marginal advantage you can grasp at" and "it'll suck when a roll nullifies a good plan".  The former is not what the move states, and the latter is impossible.  However, perhaps I've made it counter-intuitive by introducing the concept of "convincing reason it will work" and by rolling a die even when nothing is at stake.<br/><br/>Does anyone have better ideas for (a) communicating a high standard of planning, for which anything beneath is clearly a waste of time, and (b) authoritatively signalling an end to the discussion?<br/><br/>Also, W-Monk, any idea how to make it clear that this should streamline planning, not discourage it?  I would hope the right wording would suffice.<br/><br/>Paul, I like the experiment with specific conditions, but I would rather match the rewards to the effort, rather than treating "cover every contingency" the same in both simple and complex situations.  Incremental feedback/reward seems more appropriate to me than making it global.  (Also, "covered every possible contingency" and "addressed countermeasures", to me, sound <i>extremely</i> likely to elicit irrelevant minutiae.)\n<blockquote>Crossing hazardous terrain is not a particularly fascinating problem but it comes up from time to time. Set x to 2  "convincing reasons a player can give why the plan should work" before a Form Plan roll can be made.<br/><br/>Destroying the vampire Prince of a city; now <i>that</i> requires some grand scheming - it should take more time and be more interesting, too. Set x to 6 (or whatever).<br/><br/>x will roughly equal the time and thought that a plan requires/deserves. Now roll Form Plan.</blockquote>\nThis is cool!  Some acknowledgment up front of "hey, this deserves serious thought" or "this should be quick" might help frame the discussion appropriately.<br/><br/>For x=3, though, I'm not a huge fan of "we've got 2, we <i>have to</i> think of one more" or "we've got 3, let's stop immediately even though we had other cool ideas ready to contribute".<br/><br/>If we could combine a complexity measure with some uncertainty and some incremental benefit, that might be ideal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427829/#Comment_427829" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-31T02:31:50+00:00" title="January 31, 2014  2:31AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2014 2:53AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thought:<br/><br/>A major source of conversational slog during planning is <i>hopping back and forth between "<b>what</b> is the plan?" and "<b>how</b> will we execute it?"</i><br/>It's usually more fun if "what" is quick; after that, "how" can be longer, as long as "what" is truly decided.<br/><br/><b>The bad version:</b><br/>We've got a battering ram, a grappling hook, and a bow.  I bet I could shoot a guard.  But then we'd be seen by the lookout.  Oh, or I could shoot the lookout.  If I did that, would it help?  I guess we could sneak in.  Or we could ram the gate.  How hard would it be to ram the gate?  Well, what exactly is the gate made of?  Hmm, maybe we should sneak.  Does that seem tricky?  How much noise would the grapple make, hooking onto the wall?<br/><br/><b>The good version:</b><br/>We can try an obvious attack or a stealth incursion.  How hard would it be to ram the gate?  How tricky does it seem like it'd be to sneak?  <i>Okay, let's sneak.</i>  How much noise would the grapple make, hooking onto the wall?<br/><br/>The good version skips "What exactly is the gate made of?", which can actually be a long conversation, which saps everyone's enthusiasm when it turns out not to matter because we're not ramming the gate.<br/><br/>The key skills my groups lacked:<br/>- how much info is sufficient to choose a course of action?<br/>- how do we establish that info most efficiently?<br/><br/>As GM, I managed this most effectively when I provided enough Risk, Reward, Odds and Uncertainty info to contrast the options and make them seem meaningfully different.  Players can usually choose pretty quickly between "plan A risks you falling in the pit, but that seems unlikely, and if you make it you're close to the treasure" and "plan B risks you getting attacked, which seems fairly likely, and if you make it you'll be in some unknown corner of the castle".  The key was for me to get a decent idea of their plan A and their plan B quickly and before they'd become too committed to working further on either one.<br/><br/>Maybe my <b>Form Plan</b> idea is putting "enact or abandon" after too much processing.  Maybe it's better to formally structure the beginning of the conversation more, and the end less.  <b>Appraise Inchoate Plan</b> or something.  It could function like an AW <b>Read</b> move, but instead of reading an entire situation, you "read" your own plan proposal.  Use it and the GM identifies your plan's apparent pros and cons.  Dunno if there's virtue in a failure option, though, so a roll might not be appropriate.

The ceaseless planning and lack of pacing control is, as I understand is, a feature rather than a bug in OSR play. Anything you do to artificially constrain player agency is goint to grate with the play style of OSR. I'm not an expert, but I suspect that the OSR answer for this is put a clock on the players and roll for wandering monsters. <br/><br/>A Social Game would be either a system, like Burning Wheels or Ars Magica, that allows social action as the center of attention and treats it in the same depth as combat in a hack and slash game, or a system like Fiasco where the social interaction is the point of the game full stop. I could see room for a game where 90% of the play time is a planning excercise adjudicated through social and resource rules with a resolution phase at the end where the success or failure of the plan plays out like social defense. <br/><br/>That kind of thing is not typically an OSR play style though.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427834/#Comment_427834" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-31T07:23:23+00:00" title="January 31, 2014  7:23AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2014 7:25AM by WarriorMonk.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh wow, realization just suddenly hit me. I've seen some actual plays on youtube and at first I thought that players were acting a bit awkward because they were being on camera, or that they tend to play the game slow just because they were slow talkers. From what I read now it looks like actually my group's play is kinda frantic. 30 minutes of [pitch idea]/[adjudicate]/[roll]? That would took us 5 more minutes top! And yes I meant a sorta unestructured game here, which is kinda what my last hack is doing. But ok, that's us, seems your problem is almost entirely different then.<br/><br/>David, the solution is to take this move into the troubleshooting part of your core rules. Some groups just have lots of fun making plans for hours, though for those groups, presenting them an empty room after that hour of planning would be like a practical joke, and something that any GM should do only once, for the sake of keeping things varied, but then resume on complex deadly challenges as usual.<br/><br/>Another big group of players seems to have fun making plans, but their group is unfocused enough to make these part take too long or even become boring. For these, some training in quick thinking may be enough. Put them on a clock of wandering monsters.<br/><br/>The last big group (which seems to be your case) are players stubborn enough to resume on their boring planning even after defeating wave after wave of wandering monsters. Don't mistake these players with "people you shouldn't play with" or disfunctional in any way, since most probably they are incredibly skillful and functional for every other aspect of the game, but are so used to take indirect approaches to handle the fiction that no GM can get a straight plan from them. Those are the players this move is made for.<br/><br/>About people used to indirect approaches, let me expand a little. These are the kind of players that would ask "What the door is made of?" and other minutiae expecting the GM to made a "mistake" that allows them to break the challenge trough the use of one of their skills, items or personal player knowledge of physics, thermodynamics, etc,etc. And by "break" I don't mean "defeat" but overcomig the challenge in a way that makes it useless all the prep the GM made for it, and even more. Making the GM discard their prep is an additional prize. For some of these players, outplaying their friends with their intelligence and/or quickness of thought is the real game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427851/#Comment_427851" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-31T18:24:18+00:00" title="January 31, 2014  6:24PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>A major source of conversational slog during planning is <i>hopping back and forth between "<b>what</b> is the plan?" and "<b>how</b> will we execute it?"</i><br/>It's usually more fun if "what" is quick; after that, "how" can be longer, as long as "what" is truly decided.<br/></blockquote>\nHow interesting! Now we're moving towards some actionable goals. Would you say that this restatement of the problem covers what you were saying before? Or is it just an <i>example</i> of the *kind of thing* you want this solution to provide?<br/><br/>I think there's certainly value to giving the players a "button" to push, and in concrete terms this may mean something like:<br/><br/>1. Creating a system which guarantees the players some degree of success so long as they try.<br/><br/>Your "Form Plan" roll, AW moves, and many generic conflict mechanics do this: the players feel secure forming a plan and putting it into action because the system gives some guarantee of success. They KNOW that they're not wasting their time, and therefore are more willing to go ahead.<br/><br/>Consider, for comparison, how a lack of modifiers/difficulty numbers makes it much easier for AW players to roll moves. You *know* you're guaranteed good odds of success if you decide to go aggro on that dude (or whatever), so there's no need to hesitate: you can just go for it.<br/><br/>2. Creating a "button" which gives the players more information than they would get otherwise.<br/><br/>Another way to address this is to say, "OK, once you actually do commit to a plan, this thing here happens, which gives you extra information." Your "read a sitch" idea is not bad here (except for, as you say, potentially stalling play on a failure and/or removing player skill from the equation): once you settle on a plan, you get to roll (or whatever), and some more information comes your way. That's a strong enough incentive to push forward and commit to a plan, start dealing with specifics. I'd go for that.<br/><br/>As for the more nuts-and-bolts design questions, I agree with you that my earlier categories might not be the best - you have to fit them to the style of play you're going for, and ideally tailor them to how the specific game works, as well. For instance, if "addressing every possible contingency" must be balanced with "if you take too long, wandering monsters attack", that creates a meaningful strategic decision in the game. Without something like that, it's potentially a nasty trap, unless you *want* your players to consider contingencies as thoroughly as possible.\n<blockquote>Paul, I like the experiment with specific conditions, but I would rather match the rewards to the effort, rather than treating "cover every contingency" the same in both simple and complex situations.  Incremental feedback/reward seems more appropriate to me than making it global.  (Also, "covered every possible contingency" and "addressed countermeasures", to me, sound <i>extremely</i> likely to elicit irrelevant minutiae.)</blockquote>\nAgreed!\n<blockquote>If we could combine a complexity measure with some uncertainty and some incremental benefit, that might be ideal.</blockquote>\nThe simplest way to do this mechanically might be something like this:<br/><br/>* For each advantage/benefit/whatever that your plan has, you get +1 to the roll (a minor bonus).<br/>* Any given situation has a certain "complexity". If you do not have at least that many advantages/benefits, the roll is penalized by one die (a major penalty).<br/><br/>This way you get both effects: it's always helpful to get as many advantages/benefits you can, but the effect is stronger at first and weaker afterwards. Say your attempted plan has a complexity of 2, this looks like this:<br/><br/>No benefits: roll with two penalty dice<br/>One benefit: roll at +1, with one penalty die<br/>Two benefits: roll at +2<br/>Three benefits: roll at +3<br/>Four benefits: roll at +4<br/><br/>So the first two "reasons this is a good plan" make a huge difference, and after that the difference is smaller. The players may or may not know the "complexity" of a given problem, depending on how much of a guessing game you want this to be.<br/><br/>There could also be ways to model this more incrementally, with die pools, but I don't know if it's worth the trouble.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427852/#Comment_427852" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-31T18:35:26+00:00" title="January 31, 2014  6:35PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, there's a disconnect here with the Form Plan language.

It's an arbitrary "egg-timer/wandering monster roll". All it would take is for two or more Players to Champion their own plans and bickering, waffling and indecision abounds. And taking too long by who's estimate? The GM? The most bored player? When exactly does "long" become "too long"?<br/><br/>I'm going to suggest a Player initiative that might get things moving. Initiate the Form Plan roll (whatever that might be) when one Player calls for it and another Player seconds the motion. That's two Players saying "This game is becoming the Suck. Let's just DO SOMETHING!" <br/><br/>Having one Player call for Form Plan is a clear signal to Plan Champions that they better put forth closing arguments now or someone is just going to second it and you're left with an arbitrary roll or an admission that no clear plan is forthcoming. Shit or get off the pot. <br/><br/>This might not work for every group but having at least two Players at the table getting bored/frustrated is a clear indication that a little post-game conversation is in order. Specifically, the 20/4 rule of thumb (20 minutes of fun in 4 hours of play). If at least two people aren't bored by planning then planning must be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427895/#Comment_427895" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-02T21:13:22+00:00" title="February  2, 2014  9:13PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to look at this whole thing backwards. My assumption is that every plan made up by the players is going to fail at some point. ("No plan survives contact with the enemy.") That's where the drama happens and the play needs to begin.<br/><br/>So to me the whole question is not if, but when. <br/><br/>I like the idea of a system that generates how far into the plan the first point of potential catastrophic failure occurs, and assume everything up to that point proceeds according to plan (all snipers hit their targets, all stealth checks are made, etc.). Until bam, something goes wrong at d100 percent of the way through the plan.<br/><br/>To my mind, rolling to see what the players think of their plan is pointless because well it's their plan and we all know it's going to fall apart anyway. The question of how long they spend chasing their tails while trying to plan is a separate issue -- if you tell them there's a bad plan, they'll just fix it anyway -- and it isn't one that can easily be solved by a die roll.<br/><br/>Some players really love long planning sessions. Others hate it. I'm not sure there's an easy rule-based way to reconcile the two groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427897/#Comment_427897" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-02T22:37:16+00:00" title="February  2, 2014 10:37PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2014 10:39PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually already have a procedure to cover "who's tired of spending time on this right now and wants to move on", based on a <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">Pacing Dial</a>.  The social level was actually totally fine in my group, the issue was just efficiency.  Basically, once players in this sort of game get invested in tackling a problem, <i>no one</i> wants to call an end without having given it their all.  We <i>want</i> to play all the way through until we get to the best solution we can!

Maybe designated player roles would help.  Maybe a hard-coded order of operations would help.  Maybe a few formal signals of transition between one phase and another would help.  Maybe using conversational cues to get to The Next Interesting Thing would help.  There could be +1s and die rolls, or not.  I think my "ask question -&gt; Gather Data / Form Plan" idea <i>might</i> help, but the die roll with nothing riding on it in Form Plan appears to be misleading, so that should probably go.  I'm open to turning the planning into its own mini-game, but I don't want managing fictional facts to be replaced by managing game facts, so that's a pretty restrictive limit.<br/><br/>I think some of these deserve more in-depth proposals.  I'll try to add one to the list.<br/><br/>The AW Savvyhead workspace move is basically "player tells GM what they want to make/fix/solve; GM must say 'yes, but here are some requirements' (from a list)".  The rules contain no die rolls or +1s, just a statement of how the group must converse regarding a certain type of fictional endeavor.  Why do people use it?  Because it's a button that gets you something, in this case a "cost for benefit" deal.<br/><br/>I've got some general player options for Delve: "I survey the area", "I search for [x]", "I try to judge if [x]".  These are kind of like Gather Data and Form Plan, but they don't get you anything more specific than the GM answering however they see fit.  Maybe I could get some mileage out of codifying the GM's answers.  For example:\n<p><b>If you can tell how the player's question serves an intended course of action, tell them whichever applies:</b><br/>- "You can tell the answer, and it is _____."<br/>- "You cannot tell the answer; to be able to, you'd have to _____."<br/><b>If you cannot tell how the player's question serves an intended course of action, ask them their goal or plan.<br/>When they answer, tell them whichever applies:</b><br/>- "I see how that fits." + answer as above<br/>- "I think a better question would be _____."  Once new question is verified, answer as above.</p>\nThis doesn't address the issue of players bouncing around between plans.  So maybe there should be some rule like <b>"When you ask a question about a new plan, that ends the questions you can ask about the prior plan without committing to it."</b>  In other words, you can leave Plan A to ask about Plan B, but after that, the only way you can ask about Plan A again is if you commit to doing Plan A.  I think this is a good idea, but won't be followed unless there's more to it.<br/><br/>Or instead, maybe there's a move you must use to add a new plan when one is already on the table:\n<p><b>When you suggest an alternate plan</b>, briefly state it, and then ask the GM as many of the following as you wish:<br/>- Which plan carries more uncertainty?<br/>- Which plan poses more costly risks?<br/>- Which plan offers the greater reward?<br/>- Which plan has better odds of success?<br/><br/>GM answers as above ("You can tell...", "You cannot tell...").</p>\nAnother thought: <b>players take turns</b>.  No one can ask two questions in a row.  So a given plan will only get pursued once everyone's into it; one person won't be able to monopolize the conversation with their pet idea.\n<blockquote>"OK, once you actually do commit to a plan, this thing here happens, which gives you extra information."</blockquote>That would be a pretty nice reward for being decisive.  Here's a thought on presentation:<br/><br/><b>Anything else?</b>  When you commit to a plan and give it a last once-over before putting it into action, roll +Sharp to see if any new factors occur to you.
