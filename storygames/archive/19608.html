Elemental mastery....  What the heck can it do?  I mean, the text says, <br/><i>When you call on the primal spirits of fire, water, earth or air to perform a task for you roll+Wis.<br/> <br/>\u2734 On a 10+ choose two.<br/> \u2022The effect you desire comes to pass<br/> \u2022You avoid paying nature\u2019s price <br/>\u2022You retain control</i><br/><br/>two questions:<br/><br/>1. The "task" could be, "fire -- kill those bubears" right?  does that mean on a 10+ they die instantly, or does that mean that damage is dealt?  how does this move work?  <br/>2. What are some examples of nature's price?<br/><br/>Also while I'm here, on a shapeshifting move it says spend hold to do a move, that means the druid doesn't have to roll to attack if the attack makes sense for his form right (bearhug an orc, no roll, just spend hold)... second, if you spend hold do you roll for damage or is it just fictional damage (ie a bear rips a dude to shreds, or rather, spend hold and roll damage?)<br/><br/>Thanks again!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435644/#Comment_435644" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T15:34:14+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  3:34PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What the heck can it do?</blockquote>It can get you in a metric fuck-ton of trouble!  Burning down cities is a barrel of laughs, right?  More seriously:<br/><br/>1) Right.  You roll the 10+ and pick two of the options.  Then I, as GM, describe what my agenda and principles demand.  The fire attacks the bubears.  Was it a little fire or big?  Are there only a few or a whole nation of bubears?  What have we previously established about how fire elementals (or whatever) work?  What have we established about bubear behavior?  Give all that and everything else I know as the GM, I make a move.  Maybe I just <i>deal damage</i> and maybe it's enough to slay all the bubears.  Maybe not.  Maybe the fire will burn them all to death but it'll take time because you commanded a candle flame.  But remember there will <i>certainly</i> be problems, too, because you didn't choose all three of those options.<br/><br/>2) fuel, time, blood, scars, future debt, unexpected consequences, etc.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435645/#Comment_435645" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T15:51:16+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  3:51PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. It could mean damage is dealt, depending on what is happening. Fire does not have the ability to "kill" those bugbears, all it can do is burn them. If the fire is small and the bugbears are currently fighting the PCs then dealing damage based on the GM's judgment and the guidelines on page 21 (23 in the pdf). If the fire is huge and the bugbears are "over there" then just decide how it works out. Probably the bugbears are toast, but maybe some run away.<br/><br/>2. Nature's Price: ask yourself "what does this element want?" If that doesn't give you anything, ask: "What does this land want?"<br/><br/>Fire wants to burn, so you must allow it to burn stuff. It wants to run rampant across the forest, it wants that house over there, etc.<br/><br/>Changing the weather could have disastrous effects. If you want it to rain where you are, maybe the price is drought on the other side of the mountains? Or maybe the price of rain is thunder and lightning. I hope none of the PCs are encased in metal on top of a horse riding over a hill!<br/><br/>If you want to summon a river, maybe you must permanently divert the flow of water, which creates swamps and islands and messes up some steading's agriculture.<br/><br/>If you want the earth to heave, maybe it also belches forth poisonous gasses. Or pieces of rock explode all over the place, or lava bursts forth from the earth, instead of just poisonous gasses!<br/><br/>3. Shapeshifting: Yes, spend a hold, automatically take the action described by the move. Roll for damage if you think the opponent should be able to withstand the attack. If not, just kill them. Like, for real, bears are sick. Anyone who tells you they would rather swordfight a bear than a man has a serious deathwish. A bear will take a sword wound and raise you a single bite that shatters your skull. Be a fan of the PCs!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435647/#Comment_435647" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T16:08:47+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  4:08PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2014 4:11PM by cupbearer11.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks to both.<br/><a href="/forums/profile/johnstone">@johnstone</a><br/>I see what you are saying relating to what the 'element wants' but how does this differ from losing control?  If a fire wants to burn, its price could be to burn down a a sacred tree which happens to be an entrance to an elven bunker (real life thing i asked for as the GM when we played last session) but where i am confused is, if the druid chooses to lose control of it instead, then that will still happen anyways right?  I mean in the end, how do these jive together?  If the druid had chosen not to pay natures price, but now has no control over the fire, what is the fire going to do with its freedom?  Probably exact its fee by force, no?<br/><br/>Second, one of the sample animal move is "take to flight".  I dimly remember the creator saying that a bird is always able to fly and shouldn't have to spend hold to do that, and yet take to flight is a move.... so how does one intrepret this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435651/#Comment_435651" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T16:46:49+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  4:46PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A price is payed and that's the end of it. When something is out of control, when does it stop? Only when the PCs stop it. So if the fire says "I want the sacred tree" and the PC is like "no way Jose" and chooses out of control instead, that just means whatever fire they summoned already is going to stick around and get worse. If it's not near the sacred tree, it can't just automatically go for it, it has to spread from wherever it is until it gets there. If it IS near the sacred tree, that could be one hell of a hard choice!<br/><br/>Basically, make the price a concrete thing that isn't ongoing (or is a permanent change) and then make out of control be that the element continues to do the thing it was asked to do and just takes it way too far.<br/><br/>Yes, if the Druid takes on bird form, she can fly automatically. But flying isn't always such an easy thing, yeah? It requires space, air currents, it takes a lot of work to get up to the sky all the way from the ground. It takes effort, skill, concentration to fly through a storm. So it is totally legit to call for a defy danger when the bird is doing some super-difficult flying. Maybe the danger is exhaustion? Maybe the danger is that she doesn't take to flight fast enough to get away from the wyvern's jaws? If she spends a hold and says "yeah no, I take to flight, done and done" then there's no roll and the move just happens.<br/><br/>Does all that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435656/#Comment_435656" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T17:26:42+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  5:26PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cool i follow. thanks.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
