I'm being a little cranky, I guess, but I specifically put that language in to make it clear that I wasn't making the mistake of tying a CA to a game.<br/><br/>Perhaps I shoulda been more specific: "Give me a game that supports RTD play in the same way that, oh, <i>Spione</i> supports Story Now play."<br/><br/>Daniel: Good point. This is what I'm getting at. I've never experienced RTD play, so I can totally accept that those games you list (which I've thought of as SN-supporting) could support RTD. I just don't know <i>what the fuck RTD is</i>, because I've never read an example.<br/><br/>Perhaps it would be more helpful to not ask for games, but instead AP reports that document RTD play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232386/#Comment_232386" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T22:59:45+00:00" title="September 14, 2009 10:59PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry.

So the last time I played it we were on a expedition to find... erm... a hindu statue of some kind.  We brained stormed some stuff like Kali Cultists and Giant Spiders and Pirates and stuff like that.<br/><br/>A moment that sticks out in my mind was that Will was playing an army colonel.  The first obstacle he faced was some of cultists.  He gave this great introductory speech as he tried to approach them to which I, as the opposition simply said, "Of course they didn't speak English."  This became sort of running gag.  Inevitably we would come across a group of cultists, pirates, whatever, the colonel would try to greet them and then for whatever reason they either didn't understand or misunderstood or whatever.<br/><br/>Another point that sticks out in my mind was a bunch of the cultists mistaking my character's book of poetry as a holy book and me every once in a while convincing them to do something on the basis that I could interpret the holy book and therefore was a prophet.<br/><br/>The obstacle someone (maybe me) failed to get through was a giant spider attack.  That was the one obstacle where it escalated to a group obstacle and we had each had to take part in fending off the giant spiders.  Nasty stuff.<br/><br/>The whole thing culminated in us fighting a giant living statue of Kali and I think ultimately destroying whatever it was we came there for in order to destroy the statue and kill the cult leader.<br/><br/>Do you see what's happening here?  It's a sequence of fun colorful pulp adventure moments.  No premise, no competition, just lots and lots of fun moments of danger and adventures.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232408/#Comment_232408" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T03:24:31+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  3:24AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans, many Cthulhu games fit this description.

They would  go around and do things related to the mission at first, but after a while they would totally ignore the mission in favor of trying to uncover the many, many secrets of the game. I would have all sorts of cool mysterious handouts full of hidden information and double meanings, I would put mysterious NPCs hiding secrets everywhere, hell even the setting itself was a mystery. <br/><br/>Now, I (and my players) would say that the fun in the game came from uncovering the secrets of the setting. There was no story to speak of (I would write up some mysterious stuff and then wing it based off random wikipedia articles and a vague idea of where things were going), and there was really no step on up aspect (success is easy, enemies have no stats and generally die as quickly or slowly as needed) and <i>the fun came from exploring the setting</i> and finding out its mysteries. <br/><br/>I would get my players saying that they had been thinking of the meanings of all the weird mysteries I'd throw at them during slow times at work. They all had their own pet theories as to what was going on. Normally they wouldn't be thinking about RPG setting mysteries, so I'd say the game gave them <i>the right to dream</i> about it, quite literally in this case.<br/><br/>On the other hand we have games like the D&amp;D-esque (homebrew system) I play in every three weeks. I like to sum that game up simply as "we actually keep track of food", by which I mean we really get into the minds of our characters. We write journals, we mull over travel plans and deal with finances, it's an insane level of detail, really, all made possible by a really devoted GM who loves that level of detail. Now, there's fighting and a certain aspect of "I'm so good at combat", as well as some form of story (although it's sort of a "there's a storyline that will progress regardless of you, come if you want" kind of thing), but the real draw of the game is being into your character, thinking what he'd do in a given situation, and experiencing the vast world that the character and his allies live in. In a sense, the game is almost more about the fun of thinking about stuff than actually doing the game itself.<br/><br/>Hope that helped. To me, those are two very concrete examples of right to dream play, but I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. I'm pretty sure I'm not, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232562/#Comment_232562" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T01:17:13+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  1:17AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Of course, the game "supports" that mode largely by not interfering with it.</blockquote>\nI think you do GUMSHOE a disservice.  I bought Mutant City Blues in the hopes that I could drift the game to a more Story Now super-powered cop drama game in a fashion similar to how I drifted 7th Sea in the past.  I discovered I could not.  The game is a well oiled machine.  It knows what it does and it does it well.  You'd have to smash many, many conceits of the game to drift it and I wasn't willing to put in the effort.  When I drift games, I drift largely by omission rather than alteration or addition.  That wasn't going to work here.<br/><br/>Another example I can't believe I didn't think of earlier:<br/><br/>Serial Homicide Unit: The way the imagined killer takes on a very tangible weight and "reality" is kind of scary.

In the moment of play that I was talking about, though, what I think you hear is the system getting out of the way to let the player play his character in line with his vision of that character -- a Right to Dream moment if ever there was one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232604/#Comment_232604" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T09:16:39+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  9:16AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>I like to sum that game up simply as "we actually keep track of food", by which I mean we really get into the minds of our characters.

Tres cool. By which I mean, tres geeky.<br/><br/>The concept of RPGs, as I understood it simply by reading traditional texts (and before ever playing), was not to create or participate in a story but to<i>live in a world</i>.<br/><br/>That's certainly one major line of development in playstyle of RPGs. The more that RPGs got away from a sort of Tactical Missions Strung Together style of play, the more the style you are describing came to the forefront. There's certainly some of that beginning very early on, and you're seeing a push towards it more openly by the mid-80s. By the early 90s and the rise of the oWoD, there's decidely a decline in Tactical Missions Strung Together style emphasis, and much more on the ideal of Being People in a Real Fake World.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I think what you picked up from your readthroughs of texts is pretty much what you were supposed to pick up.<br/><br/>And the GNS essays were more or less written, from what I can tell, at a time when the bulk of thought about what RPGs were supposed to be was aligned with that kind of thinking. However, where GNS and related discussions got folks fired up about the G and the N and they ran out and did beget a legion of games like unto the stars in the sky....S, not so much. That part of the trio simply didn't see a whole lot of enthusiastic experimentation in its support. Instead, poor old S got left in the hands of the mainstream developers to muddle about with.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, I see several different things that fall under the extremely broad S category that could be catered to. Ocassionally, some will take a poke at them, though generally, they don't tend to be approaching it fome the not-very-sexy Dirty-Hippy culture-wise direction of calling it S straight out.<br/><br/>Physics/Statistics Sim: The is Ye Olde Timey type sim with a formula for everything based on whatever research and understanding of info the designer has at their fingertips. Think of some of those supercomplex games of the early 80s. Their children are the mathematically toned down, bloaty page count games of the 90s.<br/><br/>Emulationist Sim: This is the stuff that seems to most benefit from Dirty-Hippy Game Design Experimentation. Here the digners are going more for getting the feel right and the tone and color and events right, statistics be damned, of some genre or show or source material or whatever. Several very Narrativist games seem to be commonly drifted in this direction, even if that wasn't the designer's intent. Naming names of games i've played, I'd say PTA, Universalis, Archipelago, and Spione are games that very easily drift in this direction. Spirit of the Century, from a readthrough, probably fits here as well.<br/><br/>Immersionist Sim: Lots of stuff here, and largely under-explored by the dirty hippy community, although some whispering I hear about the stuff coming out of the Jeepform community seems to indicate some very interesting experimentation going on with this one. By and large though, this is still the playground of the mainstream of game design. I find that unfortunate. I find it unfortunate because it appears to me to take a form of Physics/Statistics Sim mechanics and dump it in the lap of a single participant who then acts as a sort of human computer program for the fun of the remaining participants.<br/><br/>Co-operative World-building/refining/exploration Sim: Again, this kind of thing has benefitted from dirty-hippy game experimentation. One form of this I've heard referred to as Travelogue Sim, and might be considered similar to Sandbox style play. On the more dirty-hippy influenced end of things, there may be an awareness that the fictional world really doesn't exist in a complete form, but rather takes it's shape over time based on the actions of the players through whatever agency the the game mechanics give them as players( real people, not just characters). <b>In practice</b>, this may be occuring without mechanical support in more Immersionist Sim games as well, and may be seen as a type of betrayal by character players if it is revealed that the Sandbox doesn't really exist fully formed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232607/#Comment_232607" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T09:23:59+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  9:23AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2009 9:26AM by Daniel H..">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite>The concept of RPGs, as I understood it simply by reading traditional texts (and before ever playing), was not to create or participate in a story but to <i>live in a world</i>.</blockquote>\nMany game texts create this perception--I think it's worthy of its own discussion.<br/><br/>Edit: I cross-posted with Robert.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232753/#Comment_232753" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T00:44:26+00:00" title="September 17, 2009 12:44AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2009 12:45AM by Hans_c-o.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel H.</cite><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite>The concept of RPGs, as I understood it simply by reading traditional texts (and before ever playing), was not to create or participate in a story but to<i>live in a world</i>.</blockquote>\nMany game texts create this perception--I think it's worthy of its own discussion.<br/><br/><br/>Yeah, totally.
