First I had to print them (not so hard, but not so cheap), then I had to work out how to bind them. I had planned to use pre-made slide binders with their own plastic covers but I couldn't find one that would hold over 30 pages for love nor money (and if I had they would have cost too much to use anyway, naturally <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/>So then I decided to buy separate slides and bind them with heavy acetate covers ... only *that* seems to have gone out of fashion too! (At least in Edinburgh stationary shops). In the end I had to buy inkjet acetate instead, since that was the only thing on offer, and I couldn't get enough to do front and back!<br/><br/>It all came out well in the end though. Getting inkjet acetate let me draw a new image for the covers and print it on, and I used card for the back, which makes the game easier to flip through. Now that they are done I like them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179694/#Comment_179694" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T12:05:01+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 12:05PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep one for me, David.<br/><br/>Why's there a snake on the front instead of a nice little mouse?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179696/#Comment_179696" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T12:13:00+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 12:13PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You'd have to ask Victoria, the knotwork eel was her idea <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Also the inside is chock full of mice, one every five pages or so in fact, <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
