                    Robotech was the first RPG I played, but <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/toon/" rel="nofollow">Toon</a> was the first I ever owned and ran, and I had a lot of fun with it back in the day. The funny thing about the game, and I have no idea if anyone else noticed, was that it was in many ways designed as a silly version of GURPS. Seriously. If you have both Toon and GURPS 3rd edition, try flipping through them together some time. This isn't a bad thing, and the game is rocking fun (I ought to play it again some time; I still have all four books), but lately I've been wondering what a cartoon-inspired RPG would look like if it took in both newer kids cartoons (the original edition of Toon came out in 1984) and Forgey/indie/whatevery game design.<br/><br/>There have been cartoons like Tiny Toons and Spongebob, where the cast is much bigger than your average gaming group, and characters are brought in selectively for each episode, and even stuff like Animaniacs, where there are in effect several different cartoons being features off and on, and they very rarely interact.<br/><br/>On thing in particular I was thinking about is that there are a fair number of cartoons where there are basically two characters, predator and prey, and the predator (almost) always loses (Tom &amp; Jerry, Sylvester and Tweety, Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner, Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, etc.). How about a two-player game based around that type of cartoon?                </div>

                            Hey Neko,<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Toon is pretty much GURPS-lite. It's not a very good cartoon game, I think, it relies completely on what the players bring to the table to get a funny, "toon-like" atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The main thing that makes modern cartoons different from classic cartoons is they're built around concepts, classic cartoons were built around characters. In modern cartoons the characters are part of that concept, and every character has one single role to play within that one particular set-up. The classic characters could play pretty much whatever role was required of them.<br/>
<br/>
This is also true of the "chase cartoon". The characters you mention aren't really that black-and-white (except maybe the Roadrunner, but his role is not prey. It's just there to reveal the Coyote's character.)<br/>
<br/>
As of the number of characters in the cartoons: That's just for commercial reasons. The only reason modern cartoons have a large cast is so they can make more toys out of it. As a result, the classic chase cartoon is pretty much a thing of the past. It could make for a nice two-player game, though. I like the idea very much.                        </div>

                            There is only one mechanic in Toon that at all supports teh funny. That's getting points for making people laugh. But this is a pretty darn primitive mechanic. Akin to using EXP to reward "Good Roleplaying." Weak. <br/><br/>To whit, Toon never worked for us. I actually got bored playing it. <br/><br/>Basically for Toon to be funny, you need funny people. I'm guessing that you and/or your friends are funny. Oh, I'm funny occasionally, at random. But I can't turn on the funny. Can't angle for rewards for being funny.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I think that most people are like myself in this regard. So in terms of RPG design, I always advocate the same thing. Paranoia? Funny. Inspectres? Funny. Every time you play. Why? Because they're sitcoms. <br/><br/>Anybody can be funny in a sitcom. If you want funny, make your game a sitcom. Make the next Toon at your own risk. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

<p>Mike, I really like that. I don't know if you mean to be dismissive or not with the term "sitcom," but you're absolutely right. Because you can't spell "sitcom" without "situation", and Paranoia and Inspectres come front-loaded with a very clear Situation.</p>
<p>(If that was just stating the obvious, ignore me. I just had a little personal eureka moment reading your post about pretty much all my favorite games and the presence of heavy duty situation.)</p>

IMO one of the best things about Toon was the Tooniversal Tour Guide, with Toon-flavored parodies of roleplaying games (Dungeons &amp; Toons, Toonpunk 2020ÂÂ 1/2, Mektoon, Crawl of Catchoolu, etc.). They really knew that their audience was mostly gamers, and went ahead and hit that hard. Like how among the spells available in D&amp;T were Guacamoleball, Wall of Spam, Wall of Jell-O, Fork in the Road (a giant anthropomorphic fork appears and guards a road), etc., or how your occult investigators would encounter Deep Clowns.<br/><br/>And there was that great moment in the Toon Ace Catalog when the Table Table came into being ("YES! IT'S A TABLE OF TABLES! MWAHAHAHAHAHA!").<br/><br/>But I suspect most of the actual play type funny does come from the people playing it. And comedy is hard enough to do in general (though I play with a bunch of wise-crackers and we're always making stupid jokes anyway), so I can't imagine how to make game mechanics that specifically foster comedy in the way that indie games can foster stuff like moral dilemmas and whatnot. The best I could do is to write the whole game (<a href="http://dsg.neko-machi.com/mascot-tan.html" rel="nofollow">Mascot-tan</a>) in a sarcastic, almost abusive tone.

I'm thinking of "prey" in terms of what the character/species' expected role would be, which is of course the opposite of what it turns out to be in the cartoon. (Aside: The Cat from Red Dwarf: "They're playing cat and mouse, and the only way to win is to be the cat! ...Unless you believe those lying cartoons.") I developed the idea a tiny bit further (<a href="http://neko-rpg.blogspot.com/2006/08/tokyo-heroes-playtest-and-couple-other.html" rel="nofollow">blog post here</a>), but I've got a whole lot on my plate so who knows when that'll happen. I have a title I like at least.                        </div>
