Some projects that I like to mention are:<br/><b>Prism</b> which offers a diceless system and is more of a story game. It does provide an aquatic setting in which one plays merfolk  and it does explore relationship, religion and intimacy. It\u2019s a quite fascinating little game, at least in my opinion. <b>Triskelion</b> is a Science Fiction rpg, which uses an action-fueled, optimistic space opera take on the genre. Systemwise the Exodus system is employed, which has been developed based on OSR games.  <b>Dystopia Rising</b> is the newest project by Onyx Path, which aims to realize the second edition of the game using the Storypath System. The system has already been utilized for both SCION and Trinity and the setting has a big, active fanbase among larpers. Its take on the post-apocalyptic zombie genre isn\u2019t to unfamiliar but yet not trite. I personally feel tempted and got the project up for later review. <b>The Jack Hack</b> basically does a Black Hack take on the Victorian setting. Offering several takes whether its investigating the White Chapel murders, uncovering cults or other themes.<br/>The other RPGs are as well intriguing, for the the most part, and I do recommend to have a look at them. There are two gamebooks within the collection as well. <b>SNAKES and GESTAPO</b> attempts to get a translation of a book funded that has been originally published in French. While I didn\u2019t like the first project as much, this one looks better done and actually interesting. The other gamebook is <b>Midnight Legion</b>, which I think is cool as well.<br/>There are plenty more projects, from adventures, enamel pins to tiles and more, which I do recommend to have a look at:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>8 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Gamebooks<br/>2 Supplements<br/>6 Adventures<br/>6 Dice and Coin Projects<br/>1 Dice Accessoires<br/>4 Enamel Pins<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>2 RPG Card Deck<br/>2 RPG Apps &amp; Technology<br/>4 Maps &amp; Tiles<br/>1 Various RPG Project<br/>2 Other Games<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Secondary Literature<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Gamebook<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Supplement/Adventure<br/><br/>Link: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/09/02/crowdfunding-collection-83/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/09/02/crowdfunding-collection-83/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476650/#Comment_476650" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-10T21:20:49+00:00" title="September 10, 2018  9:20PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/09/10/crowdfunding-collection-84/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection No. 84, including every tabletop project started between 09/02 and 09/10.</a><br/><br/>My favorite project in this collection is the <b>Dawnline RPG</b>. The players assume the roles of vampires who try their best to protect and guide a bigger flock of humans, ever escaping from the nearing light. While the vampires have to rely on the humans for sustenance, the humans have to rely on vampires to be protected against monsters and aided. Which is a very interesting take on the genre, helped by the fact that the creator felt inspired by works like Vampire Hunter D and Darkes Dungeon. The 3d6 system appears solid and there are some intriguing mechanical idea. The project features cool illustrations, the creator has experience in delivering project. Plus: No shipping cost. I do recommend the project.<br/><b>Rockopolis</b> is a translation of an Italian game. As suggested by its name the player assume roles of band members and do their best to rock the stage. I do like the idea and the systems \u2013 including stuff like various muses \u2013 does look interesting. <b>Something Is Wrong Here</b> on the other hand is a game aiming to provide a gaming experience along the experience David Lynch delivered. The design aims for an intense, emotional game experience and if you like story games, take a look. If you like your story games more traditional, you should check out <b>Impulse Drive</b>. It sports a science fiction setting and is Powered by the Apocalypse. A SF rpg with a different twist is <b>HC SVNT DRACONES 2.0</b>, where one plays kind of animal like \u201eAliens\u201c or rather surviving and long mutated creatures. I did like the first edition and think the new one is worth having a look. If you like it more traditional,.. Advanced Fighting Fantasy does kickstart <b>Demons of Doom</b>, which might be interesting for fans of fantasy games.<br/><br/>There are tons of other cool projects. Like <b>Dortoka</b> a supplement facilitating the creation of a city in OSR and PbtA. The <b>Reality Shard</b> and <b>Diffusion dice</b> do look great, imho.  The <b>Retro Dice</b> have a unique design, done by Mark Kelly and do offer a stretch goal with Mark Rein-Hagen. The <b>Mad Dice</b> are apparently color changing. Well, and there are tables, nice and useful card decks and many, many more projects.<br/><br/>In regards to the projects in various languages. The French corebooks are quite beautiful to look up, the Italian and Spanish offer interesting insights and the German one collects to translate a Starfinder book. I did drop the Portuguese platform from the collection, as I noticed that the platform doesn\u2019t sort by date and as my time/headspace is limited. If you like to see a Portuguese project in here, just drop me a message.<br/><br/>Tho, I just stop talking and let you have a look (you might like to be quick, as quite some project got rather tight timeframes):<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>5 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Story Game Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Supplements<br/>1 Setting<br/>3 Adventures<br/>5 Dice &amp; Coin Projects<br/>2 RPG Tables<br/>2 RPG Cards<br/>1 RPG Notebook<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>1 The Dark Eye Miniature Project<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings<br/><br/>1 Supplement<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Supplement<br/>1 Campaign<br/>1 Secondary Literature<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/>Link: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/09/10/crowdfunding-collection-84/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/09/10/crowdfunding-collection-84/</a></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476743/#Comment_476743" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-25T15:47:56+00:00" title="September 25, 2018  3:47PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/09/25/crowdfunding-collection-85/" rel="nofollow"><b>Crowdfunding Collection no.85</b>, including every tabletop project started between 09/10 till 09/25.</a><br/><br/>Given I had to take a week long break, I present more than 72 fresh tabletop rpg crowdfunding projects. Including quite some from Germany, France and Spain.<br/>I did back the German translation of\xa0<b>Itras By</b>, do feel tempted by <b>HANDB\xdcCHER DES DRACHEN II</b>, and the french games <b>MACCHAB\xc9ES</b>\xa0and <b>MANTRA : ONIROPUNK</b> caught my attention, as did\xa0<b>Longue-Ville</b>\xa0a richly illustrated book presenting a setting that could\xa0 fit a game.<br/>Safe from this little excursion in different languages there are many, great English projects and games. Thus if you liked Watership Down, you might be happy that\xa0<b>Bunnies and Burrows</b>\xa0is aiming to fund its third edition. Alternatively you could take a look at\xa0<b>Rodent Rangers</b>, which aims to be kid friendly. If you like to play more bunnies, other animals or even humans, take a look at\xa0<b>The Forest Hymn &amp; Picnic</b>. Which features a system created by the designer of Shadow of the Demon Lord.<br/>If you wonder how Italians would imagine a fantastic Italy based on Rome, checkout\xa0<b>Lex Arcana</b>. Next to the aforementioned quirk it looks cool and reads solid. <b>Things from the Flood</b>\xa0is a continuation to Tales of the Loop and has the characters discover mysteries, aliens and corporate misshieve in the 90ties. Just like Tales it features art by St\xe5lenhag.\xa0<b>Return to the Stars</b>\xa0makes a jump forward and offers optimistic Science Fiction running on Fate Core. Going back <b>Castle and Crusaders</b>\xa0as well as <b>The Epic of Dreams</b>\xa0do give you your fantasy kick. C&amp;C in more traditional fashion, the Dreams in a more story game way.\xa0Alternatively you might rob the sea with <b>North Sea Epilogues</b>\xa0or have fun with yourself and <b>Avalon's Solo Adventure system</b>.<br/>There are many, many more interesting projects and trying to list them would likely bore you, thus just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Animal Role-Playing Games<br/>2\xa0Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>1\xa0Science Fiction / Fate Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Solo-Role-Playing Games / Gamebooks<br/>1 LARP<br/>3\xa0Settings<br/>4 Sourcebooks<br/>3 Adventures<br/>4 D&amp;D 5E Adventures<br/>5 Dice Projects<br/>5 Dice Accessoires<br/>3\xa0Podcasts<br/>4\xa0Card Decks<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>4 RPG Comics<br/>5 Various RPG Projects<br/>6 Maps, Minis &amp; Tiles<br/>2 Other Projects<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Secondary Literature<br/>1 Role-Playing Game Podcast<br/>1\xa0Game based on a RPG<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Sourcebooks<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings\xa0</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/><b>Blog-Article:</b> <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/09/25/crowdfunding-collection-85/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/09/25/crowdfunding-collection-85/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
