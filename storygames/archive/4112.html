I'm not looking for generalized processes, e.g., I sit in a cafe on the Rive Gauche, sipping Taster's Choice until a vision comes to me. No. Give us one of your games and tell us how you came up with that idea. Specifically!<br/><br/>I'll start, using <i>Passages</i>. I've actually told this story several times before.<br/><br/>I really wanted to do a licensed rpg. I sent out total fliers for things like Thundercats. No success. Indeed, no real responses at all. I don't recall specifically how the idea struck me, but I decided to look at public domain material as the basis for a game. (I think it might have been when I saw an e-publisher do a d20 supplement for the Wizard of Oz, but I cant' be certain.) I starting considering a lot of different ideas: Alice in Wonderland, War of the Worlds, Treasure Island, to name a few. I was having a hard time deciding, so I finally just said: I'll use all of them. And the basic concept for <i>Passages</i> was born. It wasn't until I got a little ways into it that it became obvious to me that it was a clone of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92160/#Comment_92160" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T10:01:42+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 10:01AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm often inspired by the creative constraints of contests.

The ingredients that leaped out at me were ruined city and romance.  I liked the idea of using romance as a central feature immediately, so I looked for a ruined city to put that in.  I'd been reading Anthony Beevor and had the second World War on my mind, poked around a little on line, thinking maybe I would focus on the siege of K\xc3\xb6nigsberg, but I was stunned to learn about the Grey Ranks and that just nailed it.  I've got Polish family and I knew about the Warsaw uprising, but I hadn't heard about the Grey Ranks at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

The more I read the more I thought, "I so want to play a game here." I also am a junky for Conan and wanted some of that in there.

One player had taken on the role of Queen, several other players created their own houses that were united under the Queen's rule. Lisa created House Stanton, possibly somewhat influenced by House Stark <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> We had a good time playing within our House (which had five or six players), moreso than when we interacted with the other people.<br><br>That game faltered after a while--unfair adjudication, sole reliance on GM Fiat, etc. We wanted to start our own game in the same vein, but solving a lot of those issues. We called it The Shattered Crown. We created a long, involved history that could lead up to several discrete, culturally different Houses vying for positions after the fall of a uniting Empire (we didn't want to have a central ruler in place). Thus the Berengad was born.<br><br>The game itself didn't take off, so we developed all of the subcultures on our own. We fleshed out the whole area, populating it with cultures and figuring out their origins, histories, and so on. One of them are the Chel'qhuri, matriarchal nomadic warrior tribes, the only ones that were never defeated by the Empire. The Chel'qhuri, while living in a warm climate, are more modeled after Picts (who were sometimes matrilineal) and Germanic tribes than American ones.<br/><br/>Now, in the meantime, I became involved with the Forge. I wrestled for a while with the concepts of the Big Model, but ultimately there were certain things about it that made a lot of sense to me. Then I had a discussion, started by Callan Sweet, about the different ways you can deal with challenges in a Gamist context: you can either "explore" challenges, or you can "address" them. Exploring means that you're looking for pre-given answers and/or best strategies among limited options. Addressing (parallel to addressing premise in Narrativism) means that you come up with your own solution, one that wasn't necessarily envisioned by the creator of the challenge or the mechanics of the game. The great thing that sets RPGs apart from computer or board games, from a Gamist perspective, is that you can use your creativity and ingenuity to use anything you can imagine and come up with all kinds of cool actions and inventions.<br/><br/>I realized that, while many games allow some leeway in addressing challenges, none had this as its core principle, even though it's such a big deal (for me anyway). So I sat down to write a rule system that was focused exactly on that: narrative before dice (not just as bonus to dice) and negotiation between players, as well as other related things I wanted to see in such a game (limited GM budget, two-player focus, self-imposed difficulty level with associated reward system).<br/><br/>Then I looked at Lisa and my setting for a good venue to use these mechanics. We had made up the beast-hunting warriors among the Chel'qhuri a long time before this point, and they just jumped out at me. These were the ultimate badasses, capable of facing the kinds of challenges I wanted to see in a game. The hunting of beasts was a perfect, natural fit for the limited budget of the game and the kind of reward system I was envisioning. Plus, you get to earn cool tattoos!<br/><br/>So I wrote the first draft of <b>Beast Hunters</b>.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92216/#Comment_92216" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T11:17:42+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 11:17AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not that I have a truly finished game, but...<br/><br/>Know Thyself started by the craziness that was Game Chef.  But the point at which I felt I understood my game was when I ended up having a mechanic that could involve false memories -- which is something that I actually have.  So, while it wasn't "how I came up with the idea," it is "how I came up with what version of the idea I wanted to really explore."<br/><br/>Damned Anonymous (though it's far from complete) came from being dissatisfied with Vampire.  Now, I've never actually played Vampire, but the ideas intrigue me to an extent -- however, what I hear about from players doesn't match that.  Horror isn't about trying to acquire power, at least not for the protagonist in my view.  It can be about dealing with the power you have, and perhaps about *needing* more power.  So, I wanted to make a game about *that*, not about having kewl powerz.  I was still fairly off the mark for a good year, as I was struggling with design concepts that I was unfamiliar (at the time) with.  The "support group" element came from me trying to rack my brain over why a group of people who are "half-evil" would bother sticking together, and a friend mentioned the support group idea.  In hindsight, it should have been obvious -- one of my favorite movies is Fight Club and I was watching Starved when this idea started clicking together.<br/><br/>My idea for "Flood: Apocryphal Roleplaying" came from a little dorky idea called "Say yes *and* roll the dice."  The idea was that you always succeed in conflicts, but what's interesting &amp; mechanically important are the consequences of said conflicts.  I needed a setting that made sense with a "you always win" mentality -- first the idea was a "Fantasy First Age" idea, with elves or whatever having ultimate power, but then I quickly turned to the Nephalim myth, and thought that the mechanic could be tied into telling a story about the downfall of these giants on Earth.  I haven't really progressed from there, because it's a hard idea for me right now to make work.<br/><br/>The latest game idea that I'm hardcore developing right now, "Paranormal Containment," came from some daydreaming about having some neat power &amp; knowledge -- if I recall right, specifically about fighting demons -- and not being able to tell my friends and family, because then they'd be killed.  These daydreams often turn into fiction seeds rather than games, but the idea of a RPG where the game is superficially about having cool powers -- but really about dealing with loved ones and innocent bystanders dying around you because they find out the secret -- really appeals to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92221/#Comment_92221" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T11:21:09+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 11:21AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 11:21AM by blankshield.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clyde <a href="http://theoryfromthecloset.com/2007/05/07/show007-interview-with-james-brown/" rel="nofollow">captured me talking</a> about the specific places Death's Door came from way better than I have ever been able to put into text.<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92222/#Comment_92222" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T11:21:22+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 11:21AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 11:22AM by Rafael.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In 2001, I started gaming with this bunch of newbies. We were looking to play a horror game, so I busted out my old faves. But Call of Cthulhu didn't let them kick enough ass, and the spells just weren't wacky enough (besides, you can't put Yog-Sothoth in a headlock). Beyond the Supernatural permitted the beatdowns, but it was too complicated (for them, not me). And I wanted grittier demons -- the kind of stuff that George V. Higgins would write about, if he were a horror novelist. Creatures that feed on human hatred and filth and misery.<br/><br/>I was also kind of feeling some love for the d12. I love that die. 12 is the number of Christ's disciples. But each face is a pentagon! Evil. And they just look cool when you roll a handful across the table.<br/><br/>So that's where Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium came from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92251/#Comment_92251" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T12:09:34+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 12:09PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, none of my games have actually seen the light of day (although one is looking hopeful) but since they all have very specific origins I figure I'd share.  There's a general theme to my designs which largely arise from a desire to create games that actually reflect what genre fiction is actually about as to opposed the color/trappings approach most genre RPG design takes.<br/><br/>My very first design: Isolation was a reaction to games like All Flesh Must Be Eaten.  Most Zombie games are all about starting up chainsaws and hacking through zombie flesh.  But that's not what good zombie movies are about.  Sure the chainsaws and zombie flesh fest are fun and exciting and gruesome but what good zombie movies are about are people trapped under stress and how they *deal with each other* under such circumstances.  Something I like to say to upset film snobs is to point out that 12 Angry Men and Night of the Living Dead are fundamentally the same story.  So I wrote Isolation to ask the question can the character's get passed their biases to defeat the threat?<br/><br/>Then at some point I got fed up with Ravenloft being a pastiche of Victorian horror literature and the general confusion of Gothic with Victoriana, horror in general and a 90s club sub-culture.  You all know that The Gothic as a literary genre is a product of the ROMANCE ERA (1760-1820), right, RIGHT?!  That doesn't even include Dracula.  Also the original Gothics were relatively low on supernatural content and high on shock-value adventure.  They had more in common with Shakespeare's Macbeth than modern horror novels.  So anyway, I wanted to create a "real" Gothic Fantasy setting and have a handful of notes for a  Sorcerer &amp; Sword mini-supplement.  I've run many scenarios in this setting both privately and at cons.<br/><br/>This brings me to my current project which I'm gearing up to actually play test.  I'm a big fan of the Silent Hill video game series and in particular Silent Hill 2.  But again most home-brew RPG designs focus on the occult investigation and monster slaying aspects.  I wanted a  game that a) preserved the world switching aspect of the games and b) focused on the thematics of the second game which largely has to do with being judged for past transgressions.  So I wrote Silent Sound, a game about characters with "unpunished" transgressions in their past facing a supernatural ordeal in the form of confronting supernaturally charged mirror situations similar to their past transgressions.  Will they find damnation or redemption?<br/><br/>Looking forward about a month ago I was looking over a card game I have called Gloom which is all about trying to build the most tragic story and ultimately death for your family members.  I thought, I really want an RPG that's about this.  So I have a few vague notions for a game called Legacy which is heavily influenced by It Was A Mutual Decision.  The ruin and destruction of your family is guaranteed but what will you leave behind?<br/><br/>So those are where my designs come from.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Johnson" title="Seth Johnson"><img alt="Seth Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Johnson">Seth Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92254/#Comment_92254" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T12:12:45+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 12:12PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sketch! was born of a running joke.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, I did most of my gaming with my friend Brian Schomburg. He and his brothers were and are phenomenal artists, and whenever we'd be playing the Star Wars RPG or DC Heroes or D&amp;D, they would pass the time drawing their characters over and over. Brian and I had messed around with making our own games from time to time--mostly weird little superhero games involving graph paper and six-sided dice--so we joked that someday we would make a game where all you had to do to play was draw your character.<br/><br/>A decade later, while other college students set out on their spring break trips to Florida or Texas, I went to scenic Carbondale, Pennsylvania to visit Brian, who was working for West End Games at the time. Hanging around, reading comics and playing games, we joked again about the game where all you did was draw your character.<br/><br/>A few days later we took a day-long road trip. In the car, as we drove across eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, Sketch was born. It was called CHAOS back then (for Captain Hero's Adventures On Sketchworld), but the character creation mechanics with the basic stats and the voting were all in place. We played out a couple fights, had some fun, and then I went home.<br/><br/>Back in Madison, I mentioned the game Brian and I had made to Jon Leitheusser, then part of my local gaming group. A couple years later, when Jon started up Corsair Publishing and was looking for games to publish, he suggested I try polishing up the 'draw your character' game.<br/><br/>A year or so later, after several drafts that locked down and expanded the basic rules and expanded it into something a bit more than a fight game, and many, many play sessions where I solicited drawings from anyone that happened to be passing by (all the drawings in the margins of the book are from real players, many of whom had never played any sort of RPG before), Sketch took on its published form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92256/#Comment_92256" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T12:15:10+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 12:15PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My games always start with me trying to figure out how to do something I don't know how to do.

Not sure why, other than it seemed too confining and superficial and corny. So I shifted the religion away from Vodou over to Hoodoo, or conjure, or more specifically, African American folk magic. I tried to make the mechanics reflect superstitions in number combinations, specific spells for luck in gambling, and using mojo or gris gris bags for spells (which happen to be the size of a deck of cards).<br/><br/>So all this happened near the end of a PTA game where we did season 8 of Buffy, post Katrina, at the other hellmouth in Cleveland. My character was a 150 yr old Voodoo priestess who had been in a mystical coma in New Orleans. She was a fun character, and I wanted to explore more about where she came from. Then I thought, "what if you're a slave?" And there it was. I gave up on exploring the character. My mom is a history professor and the antebellum south is one of her areas of research. So I had access to good resources, and I grew up learning about slavery through my mom's library and geneaolgical research. Towards the end of development I got rid of the Yahtzee mechanics. We were playing Dogs a lot and I developed a fond affection for lots and lots of dice, and I thought, wouldn't it be interesting if your stats are related to your market worth as a slave? And there it was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92299/#Comment_92299" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T13:48:54+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  1:48PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            almost always from books or other writings- the general subject matter or something specific make me think this would be an interesting game... sometimes contest criteria or stuff from other games help focus my thoughts.

For instance Reel Adventures, which I am currently developing, has a mechanic in it which is strongly influenced by the Twilight Pool in the LOTR CCG. <br/><br/>Mob Justice started off life as a card game idea when I was playing a lot of CCGs. I then binned it and got to work thinking about RPGs and the basic ideas from it came back into play and I started work. Initially the game was very strongly influenced by games like WFRP, Deadlands and Seventh sea which was about all the exposure I had had to RPGs at the time.<br/><br/>When I got around to taking the game to Gencon in 2005, Luke and Jared gleefully tore my game a new one and I got to rethining it with Loyalties, Codes and Tells alongside Reputaion and Stature finally making it the game it was meant to be. A lot of the influence for how the mechanics work comes from how movies do things, as I wanted a very cinematic feel to the game. I think the main ones where Goodfellas, Heat, Godfather Trilogy and Usual Suspects. Also the poker mechanic is probably influenced a bit by my days playing Deadlands. <br/><br/>The story chips, game from my disatisfaction with the aribtrary deciscions that come up in a lot of RPGs and where merely a way to regulate the interaction between GM and player and they seem to work very well. That kind of regulation is proabably something I will return to in other games alongside 'Define through play' which is my big thing at the moment. <br/><br/>Hope that was useful/interesting.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92439/#Comment_92439" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T08:16:59+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  8:16AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://unwrittencontinuum.com/" rel="nofollow">unWritten</a> came from me trying to create the "perfect game."

We wanted to do a game that was a good "side project" for testing and proving certain system concepts on the road to the Dresden Files RPG, and pulp seemed like the perfect lightweight fit for those intentions.<br/><br/>Don't Rest Your Head came out of soaking my head in things like Midnight Nation, Neverwhere, Dark City, and Doom Patrol.  That formed the fertile soil from which many thoughts grew the moment I heard a story on NPR about the military developing a drug that enabled soldiers to perform without any feelings of sleep deprivation.  It had a hitch, though; if you stayed awake for too long on the stuff, your body would simply shut down -- you die.  That seemed both fantastic and far too mundane to me, so my brain leapt from there to "what if, instead, at the point of death, some people get <i>unlocked</i> and see the secret world?"  Lots of stuff spooled out of my brainmeats from there.<br/><br/>Chimaera, Schizonauts, Escape or Die!, and others all came out of one design contest or the other.  I could get into the core of some of the influences here, but really the constraints of the contests are the stars of the piece.  When I participate, there's usually a sudden, chemical reaction when I hear what my constraints in a contest are going to be, and much of the game ends up springing to life almost fully-formed in my head.  Schizonauts, conceptually, formed within 5-10 minutes of hearing the ingredients for Game Chef 2007 (ask Rob D., he was standing there when it happened).  Chimaera... I didn't quite know the game was about Godzilla's girlfriend right away, but it got there pretty fast, once I saw Adam's sheet.  Escape or Die! was part of the compact RPG challenge that ultimately didn't go much of anywhere; we knew we had to do a complete RPG on the front and back of a single sheet of paper, with a technological theme.  That made me feel pressured, and most often I'm pressured by time and myself; so then a clock motif aggressively asserted itself and paired up with the idea of self-pressure to produce ... well, the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92476/#Comment_92476" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T13:07:32+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  1:07PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played this awesome game a zillion years ago called Homeworld, and I thought, what a cool concept for a game. It prompted me to write up my own "we're not actually from here" setting that led to a pretty standard mainstream campaign. Afterward I thought, here's another cool place for a game/story. That was when I came across the Forge and thought it'd be cool to make a game. And then Firefly was canceled, and it left a big hole that I wanted to fill with cool space adventure-drama stuff.<br/><br/>So that combination of imagining what I thought would be cool and aggressive stripping away of unimportant game mechanics got me to crib more and more from TV concepts. Pretty soon I was like, I should just ditch the setting and have the game be about any kind of TV show. So that was Primetime Adventures.<br/><br/>Then I went back to the setting and thought about it again in terms of game stuff, character drama and the things I love in movies and TV, and that has since become Galactic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92478/#Comment_92478" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T13:09:44+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  1:09PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might be interesting at some point to do a Game Chef redux contest where designers go back and choose ingredients from a GC in which they never competed.

I'll only talk about the game I'm currently working on, and not the other games I'm not currently actively developing/playtesting. So, ReCoil!<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, it was creative free-writing. I just picked up a piece of paper, and started writing a story. It just flowed out of nothing onto the page. It never even made it longer than a single standard lined page. Later on, I started thinking about that old one-page, and... well, I just started thinking it'd be a cool game. From that beginning, I stole ideas from The Matrix, Mage: the Ascension, Quantum Leap... and ReCoil was born. <br/>\n<br/>\nI later found that page, and realized that many of the ideas I thought were born later, like the whole concept of spirits fighting Oblivion to save reality, were actually on that page. My conscious memory of the contents of that page was pretty iffy, but apparently my subconscious had saved all the juicy bits. Some of the things that happened on that page, which involved "training" the Agents, didn't ever make it into the game, but the core concepts did. <br/>\n<br/>\nMechanically, it's lightly influenced by WoD, in that I'm fond of dicepool games with d10s. Beyond that, I can't, at this time, consciously point to any games which were mechanically influential on ReCoil.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdited to add: Oh, I forgot to mention... If Lacuna had been created before I created ReCoil, ReCoil might never have been born. Though I've yet to play Lacuna, when I first read about it, it was almost exactly the game I'd been trying to make when I first started banging around with what I thought was going to be a narrativist game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92654/#Comment_92654" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T18:10:19+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  6:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finished or nearly finished games:<br/><br/><b>Snowball</b>:  Hanging out in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a> and going "you know, we should have a game like Memento" and then grabbing the Pool as the nearest available resource.

It is the mechanisms of the game that I really feel is the important part of the product, so obviously this will be reflected in my designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92699/#Comment_92699" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T00:48:37+00:00" title="September  3, 2007 12:48AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>specifics...merm...Mridangam was one of those, I think.

My long time friend designed this universe when he was in his early teens. He wanted to make it into a TV show. That never happened, but we used to freeform Larp out of the universe in highschool. So a few years ago, in a fit of nostalgia, I asked him if he'd like to turn his ideas into a "real" RPG. I had expected an even partnership, but being not a gamer, he opted out of all but background discussions, and it all fell to me. So, I've tried to put together something that is true to the feel of roleplaying we had as kids. I doubt I've done it, but I hope it turns out to be a good system and setting, after all.<br/><br/>On the simpler side, a game I've got backburnered (Deus: The Gods Have Lost Their Way) was inspired by a line from a Yes song I had going in the background while I was doing dishes. "In this world/I truly do believe/the gods have lost their way." I started thinking about what that world would be like, hit up Colin Fredericks as a soundboard, and started in on furthering the game. It's a bit stalled, right now, but I'm eager to get back to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerry%20D.%20Grayson" title="Jerry D.
