I've listened to a huge amount of Mike Duncan's "The History of Rome" podcast over the past few months, and wanted to do something with that knowledge and interest. The disastrous third century is really fascinating, and also presented a fantastic opportunity for a story!<br/><br/>In 270, the sitting emperor died suddenly of the plague. In real life, his presumed-successor Aurelian was primed and ready to take the job, and went on to reunify the empire. In Diadem, he's dead too. Now you, the high councilors of imperial army, are forced to make a difficult decision: who will be the next emperor?<br/><br/>This is a game of that squabble between five people with deeply crossed interests, all trying to get the best deal out of the new deal. It's a game of desperation, fear, ambition, and petty squabbling and maneuvering in a time when only unity can save the Empire.<br/><br/>The game's mechanisms were built out of Ben Lehman's incredible Amidst Endless Quiet, one of my absolute favorite games - it was a revelation when I realized my favorite sci-fi tough dilemma game was the root of my own Roman tough dilemma game. However, I've made some serious changes to just about every facet of AEQ (no central character, a vastly different tone, a steady worsening vs limited actions) to the point that I don't think it's all that recognizable.<br/><br/>I'm going to be playtesting it a bit at the end of the month, but I'm excited to share it and see what people think!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455180/#Comment_455180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-21T07:46:20+00:00" title="July 21, 2016  7:46AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Amidst Endless Quiet</i> has been one of my favorite games since it came out!<br/><br/>Downloaded this and put it near the top of my reading pile.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3vandrogm" title="3vandrogm"><img alt="3vandrogm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3vandrogm">3vandrogm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455374/#Comment_455374" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-29T14:40:11+00:00" title="July 29, 2016  2:40PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not familiar with Amidst Endless Quiet, but I have read Diadem with delight: excellent work!
