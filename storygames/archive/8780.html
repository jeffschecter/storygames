It's inspired by kung-fu stories.  Not starting over the top like I'm used to, but a down to earth kung-fu story.  I needed to have some sort of kung-fu class in there, and supernatural kung-fu, which doesn't totally arise out of Storming's magic system, but I think I got as close as I could without completely ripping it apart and putting it back together again.<br/><br/>Heavenly Rest<br/>A Town for Storming the Wizard's Tower<br/><br/>In the days of the Great Empire, Heavenly Rest was positioned between two great territories, on a river and trade route.  That was long ago, and now Heavenly Rest is a large, relatively peaceful trading community, with the great wars far away.  The town is ruled by Righteous But Short Duke Peng.<br/><br/>Heavenly Rest is built along its massive market, with large docks along the river, stalls, and traders.  There are some outlying farms, whose products are in high demand for the hungry armies of afar, wooden and clay houses, and a savvy populace who mostly make their livings tending to outsiders.<br/><br/>Heavenly Rest's largest trading partners are the great city-states of Fang and Anvil, located to the north and south.  The two states are nominally allied with Duke Peng and with each-other, but there are tensions and occasional border conflicts.  Beyond the river is a sweeping plain that gives way to desert, full of thirsty bandits.  The Great Road stretches to the east and west and carries colorful travelers on it.<br/><br/>The leader of the town is the Righteous But Short Duke Peng, who is assisted in administrating the town by his courtiers, magistrates, and Eunuchs.  The town maintains a small soldier force that keeps order in the market place and answers to the Duke's magistrates.  There are a few prosperous traders who own the docks and market stalls, and employ most of the townspeople to load and unload supplies, carry them to warehouses in town, and keep the town clean and organized.  Minor craftsmen hawk their own goods to travelers.  The top people are rather wealthy, but even the common man is relatively well-paid, with plenty of food on his plate.  Most families have Shrines in their homes, and there are a few larger shrines to some of the more prominent religions- Buddhism, Confucianism, or Ancestral Animism.<br/><br/>Character Types<br/><br/>Courtier<br/>You are a member of the Duke's court, representing a wealthy family's interests in the city.

I wrote up an Ability for a fighting-monk character type - it permits the monk to roll Skill as a part of any action in set-up, and divvy up hits between red and blue dice, but while the monk is prohibited from using arms (including armor), this is not necessarily a tactical constraint against the armed and armored.  A different take on the fighting-monk stereotype(s).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the armor thing should simply be an explicit statement of tactical constraint - a character in heavy armor can't move as quickly or nimbly, has poorer peripheral vision and hearing, can't sneak much, maybe can't cast spells as well, etc.  If you want there to be a way around this, make it part of Tireless or Feats of Strength (or if your monks wear heavy armor then part of Supernatural Kung-Fu, or part of some character type, like 'Heavy Footman of Anvil' or 'Eunuch Junior Officer').<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is striking to me that everybody has shrines in their home but you refrained from making a starting character type with Initiation.  What is your disposition about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue dice are easy to get with the Luck for Warriors spell; plus, like Shreyas said, double warfans.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, carts have never made it through a scene in a kung-fu movie (or a Western) without being used for cover.  They also are great for ramming into things, rolling downhill, filling with straw bales and lighting on fire to make a mobile smokescreen, sneaking weapons (or people!) into forts under piles of cow dung... even without a donkey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196498/#Comment_196498" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T19:37:53+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  7:37PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad i'm not the only one having trouble with Blue Dice per setting.  I've written a 'town' for StWT that is set in pre-1800's Northwestern America.  And i came up with ..uh..."Battle Leathers" and "Bone Weave" both of which are totally made up.  The Blackfoot Nations, as best i can tell, did not wear copious amounts of armor (go figure).  So, yeah, it turns into Taking Cover and stuff.  I will say, though, that it's not been a terrible calamity for our game.  So you might not need to worry about it.<br/><br/>I can't scrutinize your system for it, but the concept of "Heavy Armor Training" is a cool thing.  And the Reputation ability?  I'm totally ripping that off for our game.  It rocks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
