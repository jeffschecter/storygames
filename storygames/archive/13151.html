Vincent Baker has taken his GMing style for the game and turned it into a series of mantras.  Why don't we all do that?<br/><br/>Here are things I've almost always done when GMing pretty much anything:<br/><br/>* Make the game feel like an action-adventure movie<br/>* Announce future badness (I was doing this long before AW gave it a name)<br/>* Don't split the party (the opposite of Separate Them!)<br/>* "The player is always right" (although it often chafes)<br/><br/>Here are some things I've started doing lately, after hanging out on this forum:<br/><br/>* Prep little or none<br/>* Fish early and often<br/>* Begin 'en media res'<br/>* Say yes or roll dice<br/>* Invite off-scene players to play NPC's in the scene<br/><br/>And - that's how I've been GMing lately.

Don't make it arbitrary. Telegraph what you're planning on doing in interesting ways.<br/><br/>For example, if your players are trying to build radio infrastructure in the Wasteland, have people come and check it out. Tell them they get some visitors. Role play the situation out. Make them creepy and hard to read. Then when they get raided, they'll have some context. They're doing something cool! Other people want it. You have to fight for what you want.<br/><br/>If you just throw bad shit at them with no context, it's not about their characters. It's about you artificially trying to challenge them as players, not characters. When your players do something cool, and you have questions about it, express those questions with threats sometimes, rather than straight-up asking. If you wanna know why their radio tower matters to them, threaten it. Just don't have shit come out of nowhere.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I expressed myself quite the way I wanted to, but hopefully that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296525/#Comment_296525" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T15:35:16+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  3:35PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2010 3:45PM by John_Powell.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Listen &amp; Ask Questions, Don\u2019t Plan</b><br/>When you\u2019re the GM, don\u2019t try to plan what will happen. Instead, ask questions\u2014lots and lots and make them pointed toward the things you\u2019re interested in. Like, Cyrus gives Naomi an order within earshot of Lady Blackbird, but the Lady\u2019s player doesn\u2019t register it right away. Naomi goes to follow the order. So I ask Lady Blackbird\u2019s player, \u201cHow do you react when the Captain orders your bodyguard around? Is that okay with you?\u201d And then, when it\u2019s totally not okay,\u201cWhat do you say to him? What do you say to Naomi?\u201d and a few more like that and everyone is yelling at each other and rolling dice to impose their will.<br/><br/><b>Also ask questions like:</b>\n<blockquote>\u201cDoes anything break when you do this crazy maneuver?\u201d<br/>\u201cThe fire probably spreads out of control doesn\u2019t it?\u201d<br/>\u201cThat sounds like a bold plan. What\u2019s the first step?\u201d<br/>\u201cDo the two of you end up somewhere quiet together? Does something happen between you?\u201d<br/>\u201cDo you know anything about the Crimson Sky rebels? What are they like? Is it normal for them to be this far into the Empire?\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nKeep that going at a steady pace and the game flies along pretty well. Part of the job of the GM is listening to what the players say, catching it, turning it around and looking at it, and seeing if there\u2019s anything else to be done with it.<br/><br/><b>The GM\u2019s jobs:</b> listen and reincorporate, play the NPCs with gusto, create interesting obstacles, and impose conditions as events<br/>warrant (especially when rolls fail).<br/><br/><b>Say Yes, Look For the Obstacles</b><br/>By default, characters can accomplish anything covered by their traits. They\u2019re competent and effective people, in other words. It\u2019s no fun to ask for a roll when there\u2019s no cool obstacle in the way. Just say yes to the action, listen, and ask questions as usual. But also, be on the look out for the opportunity to create obstacles as the action develops. Because you\u2019re asking leading questions and listening closely, they\u2019ll be all over the place, so it won\u2019t be too hard to spot them.<br/>Obstacles can be people (pirates, goblins, imperials, citizens, nobles), weather, monsters (sky squid, flying eels), situations (fires, falling, being shot at, chases, escapes) or anything else you can imagine.<br/>If a character tries something not covered by their traits, that\u2019s an obstacle right there: lack of experience and training. Lots of fun things can go wrong when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing! Also, players will sometimes try things they\u2019re bad at so they can fail and add dice to their pool. It\u2019s a fine move for them and it gives you the chance to create more trouble, so everyone wins.<br/><br/><b>Conditions</b><br/>A condition constrains what the player should say about their character. It\u2019s a cue to tell the GM and players to pay attention to that thing and use it as material for the developing fiction. Gaming is just us saying stuff to each other, right? So you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat do I say now?\u201d and you look down and go, \u201cOh, I\u2019m angry. I\u2019ll go be angry at someone then. \u2018Snargle! Why aren\u2019t we at Nightport yet, you shiftless layabout?!\u2019\u201d For the GM, the conditions can create opportunities or give permissions. \u201cYou\u2019re Injured, right? The Void Spiders can smell blood. They swarm right<br/>at you, ignoring the others.\u201d Sometimes a condition will become an Obstacle in its own right, calling for a roll to deal with it.<br/><br/>-----<br/><b><a href="http://onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">Oh wait... that's John HARPER'S GMing codified...</a></b> but it is also how I've been gming lately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296543/#Comment_296543" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T22:01:39+00:00" title="October 11, 2010 10:01PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got a couple that I always seem to bring with me. <br/><br/><b>"Ask the player what "it" looks like"</b> I really love player input, thrive on it even. Whenever a player has a cool power I ask them what it looks like whenever they use it. How does it interact with the environment. Hell, how do NPCs react to their powers? If they have an object of importance to the game world I ask the player what that looks like, how heavy it is. They run into a monster? Ask the player details about what it smells like, if it wears clothes, how it sounds when it speaks. And if a player's character is an expert on something I go to them for answers on questions regarding that subject. I use these little pieces to help build the world around the players. A player in my most recent campaign played a character that was a priestess of a death god. Whenever she used her prayers she would describe their realization using things like black clouds and crows. Because of that crows became a recurring element in the game. I would describe crows in a scene and the players would know that something of terrible providence was afoot. <br/><br/><b>"Write down names"</b> I write the names of every NPC and location down as they come up in play. The act of doing that helps me form an image in my head of what that person looks like and possibly acts like. It also gives me a list of names to refer back to so I can keep my group of NPCs small and manageable. <br/><br/><b>"Stand up"</b> I'm a guy that thinks best when he's on his feet. That's just how I am. It also keeps my energy level higher. If I'm running a game and I'm not standing it might mean that I need to take an off night. This is totally one that is built for me. If you do it too, then cool, but I'm not looking down my nose at a guy seated comfortably and having a good time.<br/><br/><b>"Announce scene changes" </b>This is something that I picked up from running games that emulate movies and tv shows. I will literally say "New scene!" Just like commercial breaks in television, when used properly this can be a great way to let off just a little bit of steam or ramp up tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296568/#Comment_296568" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-12T10:16:10+00:00" title="October 12, 2010 10:16AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2010 10:18AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps related - here's a chunk of GMless advice from Medical Hospital:<br/><br/>I think the key to being a great player is to listen, unreservedly support the game as a whole, and make a commitment to helping your friends feel good.
