Their storage chamber would be lucrative to hit, too, but will have a lot of guards and traps, do we want to risk that while we're there?"<br/><br/>is much better than<br/><br/>"Well, we've killed everything and looted all the treasure in this branch of the dungeon.

Attach the fronts to spaces or areas in the dungeon. Areas that can be personified the same way as in Old School Hack. Ask what does each Front want from the players? What don't the players want to lose (including their lives). Hit them there. Make the monsters actions meaningful and driven by an emotion. Make the players descions in the dungeon have a ripple effect elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk lots and lots of questions of the characters to flesh out the dungeon rather than telling them. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319319/#Comment_319319" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T07:19:16+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  7:19AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2011 7:21AM by Teataine.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What helped me a lot was to stop thinking about megadungeons as dungeons, but rather a world. Small dungeons with a handful of rooms, those are dungeons. They can even survive being (relatively) linear. <br/><br/>I personally wouldn't treat it as a single threat (unless in the sense that the architecture itself is out to get you): Megadungeons are countries, cities, ecosystems. They should be absolutely non-linear, with many paths everywhere, some easy some hard. Think of them rather the same as the surface world ("So the goblins live <i>here</i> and the skeletons are <i>here</i>."), except it's underground-flavoured. Characters should spend days and weeks in there. Themed areas are definitely a way to do that and DW fronts should help you there, I believe. I think it's possibly more important to have a relationship map of parts of the dungeon than a detailed geographical map of it. <br/><br/>That and also try treating it as a mythic underworld, the id-cellar, the dark side, through the mirror and down the rabbit hole. A dungeon is strange, weird, creepy, crazy. It has its own rules. Don't be afraid to let your imagination go wild.<br/><br/>For inspiration: Try getting the Dungeon Alphabet or some other Old School resource thing, random tables are awesome to give you some starting seeds. Check out Zak's blog (D&amp;D with pornstars) or Philotomy's oD&amp;D site, they both have some interesting articles on dungeons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319347/#Comment_319347" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T09:24:35+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  9:24AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One simple change I would implement is that all corridors connecting sections of the dungeon should be much longer (I'm thinking that you should add about 5 miles between most areas).  This separates encounter sites and lets each one be more independent.  It also lets you camp out between areas rather than treating sessions like the TV show "24"...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319368/#Comment_319368" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T10:15:14+00:00" title="April  7, 2011 10:15AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apply all the techniques of relationship mapping and thematic conflict to your dungeon: who wants what?

It's a little dated now, but it does the "themed areas" thing Ben was talking about and has quite a few small communities you can interact with in meaningful ways. Very neat. (I've heard that UU2 is also very good.)<br/><br/>Paul's comment about the history of the dungeon is also spot-on. It's one thing if your dungeon actually <i>is</i> random-roll, but if it <i>feels</i> like random-roll, that's no good.<br/><br/>Make sure you have places for the group to pick up new PCs, and good reasons for the new PCs to join.
