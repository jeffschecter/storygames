(Also, if something is the same as an existing concept, I'll make sure I use the existing term.)<br/><br/>Another point, related: as more games are produced, a lot of everyday words get "used up". I originally was going to call my reroll mechanic Twists (an uptwist when rerolling failures, a downtwist when rerolling successes). However, Colin is using Twists in Sufficiently Advanced to mean something completely different (and more intuitively obvious, I think, though I can't just now recall exactly what it is). So my term Twists has two strikes against it now: It's not immediately obvious what one is, and it will potentially confuse people who've played Sufficiently Advanced.<br/><br/>Hence, Twists become Rerolls, divided into Rollups and Rolldowns. Or even "rerolls of successes" and "rerolls of failures", but I think Rollups and Rolldowns is probably clear enough once explained, and more concise.</blockquote>\nTo which Shreyas said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I think there is a good deal of value in designing such that you have to name the fewest amount of things! I like your use of "reroll" Mike, although I find it hard to imagine a situation where you'd want to use 'rollup' and 'rolldown'...they're in complementary distribution, right?</blockquote>\nAnd Elliot said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>(Also, if something is the same as an existing concept, I'll make sure I use the existing term.)</blockquote>IMO this is less important than "owning" the terms you use. E.g., I've seen a tendency to borrow terms from other games, give credit and maybe quote a passage, as if this economizes on the amount of rethinking, rewriting, and relearning that has to happen before the player gets the concept. And I think it's the opposite: referring to another game creates more confusion as it gives the impression that there's a Platonic ideal out there, independent of your game, which needs to be researched by reading other games or discussing it endlessly on discussion boards.<br/><br/>So I replied:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>Good point, Elliot, thanks - when using an existing term, that doesn't mean I shouldn't explain the existing term as if my readers haven't encountered it before (as I mentioned on another thread, talking about the terms "GM" and "NPC" and how they get used without definition in game texts). If they have encountered it before, they'll quickly realize as they read the explanation, "Oh, this is like in TSOY" (or whatever) and move on; if not, the explanation is necessary for them to understand it.<br/><br/>Shreyas, I'm not sure what you mean by "complimentary distribution". Rollups and rolldowns in the Pentasystem are complementary, yes, but the distinction is important. You invoke a rollup by describing an advantage you have relating to the attribute you're using, it costs you a point, and you reroll a failure; you invoke a rolldown by describing a disadvantage, it gets you a point, and you reroll a success. I think that justifies making a distinction, and having specific terms.<br/></blockquote>\nI then realized that the thread was totally derailed, and started this one so we can carry on.<br/><br/>EDIT: The thread on which I talked about the use of "GM" and "NPC" was <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3621" rel="nofollow">the Story Game Basic thread</a>, on which I said in response to joepub's advocacy of Dogs, among others, as an introductory game:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite><br/><br/>So, I just finally bought Dogs, because I hear so much about how it is a great, clearly explained game text (as well as a great game), and also<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I may be able to steal some ideas</span>it's potentially an, um, significant influence.<br/><br/>I'm seven pages in.<br/><br/>I've already struck two roleplaying jargon acronyms ("GM" and "NPCs") which are not defined or explained. The first one occurs in the "If You've Never Roleplayed Before" section.<br/><br/>I've had the same experience with several other indy games (Trollbabe, which also never defines "d10", and at least the prerelease PDF of Full Light, Full Steam - I haven't checked the printed copy to see if Joshua acted on my suggestion to define these terms).<br/><br/>This doesn't make these games terrible texts. It does, however, mean that a complete roleplaying newbie, with only the text, is going to be confused by unexplained jargon, just because the writers have an unconscious assumption that "everyone knows who the GM is and what an NPC is".<br/><br/>There's also an assumption that the text doesn't need to stand alone, because roleplaying is inherently something which is taught by those who know to those who don't know; that there's a social process by which this knowledge is spread aside from the contents of the texts. This is why games like Shock: and Capes provide people with good gameplay despite the fact that many find the texts themselves confusing. But I'd like to challenge that assumption, and support E.T. Smith in doing the same.</blockquote>\nSo now you have all the context.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82440/#Comment_82440" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-20T04:40:49+00:00" title="July 20, 2007  4:40AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mike,<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have anything terribly insightful to add, but your Dogs/Trollbabe/FLFS points reminded me of a time in the deep and distant past -- I'd just bought the Player's Handbook for AD&amp;D; (1st ed.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm pretty sure that the back cover blurb said "contains everything needed for play" or words to that effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept that the "To Hit" tables were in the Dungeon Master's Guide...<br/>\n<br/>\nMan, was I confused.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nDarcy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
