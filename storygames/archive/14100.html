Its principles have been applied to all kinds of things, including story games. Joel Shempert (Dreaming Crucible) has blogged about it <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/fluency-play/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2010/02/28/where-are-your-keys/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, Jason Godesky (theFifthWorld, Storyjammers podcast) has blogged about it <a href="http://thefifthworldsg.blogspot.com/2009/09/fluency-play.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and podcasted about it <a href="http://storyjammers.com/post/1643675167/season-1-session-4-fluency-play-download-mp3" rel="nofollow">here</a> and been interviewed about it on the Jennisodes <a href="http://www.jennisodes.com/podcasts/fluency-play/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and I probably started it all <a href="http://www.mythic-cartography.org/2009/03/30/the-pedagogy-of-play-bite-sized-pieces-part-iv/" rel="nofollow">here at the College of Mythic Cartography</a>, applying "fluency play" to teaching/learning Polaris. <br/><br/>First I'll be presenting the "Where Are Your Keys?" accelerated learning design system at the Agile Games 2011 event, April 14th-16th.<br/><a href="http://whereareyourkeys.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://whereareyourkeys.org</a><br/><a href="http://agilegames2011.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://agilegames2011.com</a><br/><br/>Then I'll have a week free, the 17th-21st, to play story games, talk about (and do demo games!) of accelerated learning, language hunting, and story-game fluency play. I have a fluency-play hack of Archipelago II I've been working on for a while that I'd love to share.<br/><br/>Then I'm running three days of "Where Are Your Keys?" games, 22nd-24th, More info at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/WAYKboston" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/WAYKboston</a>. This is my first trip to Boston, and probably my last, so I'd love to connect up with anybody interested while I'm in town.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319045/#Comment_319045" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T08:00:21+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  8:00AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2011 8:00AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are near Boston and can play WAYK it is <i>totally worth your time</i> - I was sort of skeptical and on the fence based on reading about it and watching videos and so forth, but actually playing made me a believer. It is one of those things that has a lot of clever bits - kinaesthetic and otherwise - that are difficult to convey. I've only spent an afternoon with the techniques and it was enough to change the way I think about how I approach game design.

If you want to try to hatch a plan, whisper me and lets cook something up.<br/><br/>By the way, in the original post it sounds a bit like I invented WAYK - to clarify, the original developer is Evan Gardner. He and I partnered in co-developing the game a couple years ago, and now it's constantly being improved by a growing community of experienced player/game-leaders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319203/#Comment_319203" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T16:14:04+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  4:14PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I so, so, <em>so</em> want to get to this one day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/willem" title="willem"><img alt="willem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/willem">willem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320166/#Comment_320166" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T13:10:41+00:00" title="April 12, 2011  1:10PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the by, it turns out I can invite a guest to the Agile Games event, if there's someone wanting to tag along.
