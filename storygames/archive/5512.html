I'm not just saying that as a passive-aggressive, "no thanks," because I think it would genuinely be interesting.<br/><br/>My answers, in order of strongest to weakest:<br/><br/><b>I've got an idea</b>: I have had fun ideas for games, and I want other people to try them. I do not believe many people will try them if they're not investing (literally) in a book that they can carry around with them. I want many people to try them.<br/><br/><b>The game doesn't exist yet</b>: My motivation for the game I'm working on right now has to do with the fact that there's no game out there that's designed precisely to do what I want my game to do. Since becoming friends with people who design games, I've come to feel that the proper thing to do when confronted with that situation is to make a game. See <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> for why, for this need, I'm publishing for $ rather than for free.<br/><br/><b>Socialization</b>: It's not that I want to be in the designer's crowd. It's that by designing a game, I have become much more social. Not that I was a shy and retiring flower before, but now I am required to ask people to help me, to give me input, to care about their enjoyment at a level I never have before. Designing for profit magnifies this, pushes me to be more mutual with other designers and players, to talk to more artists and layout people and editors, to help out more and to ask for help more.<br/><br/><b>Self-fund my hobby</b>: It's expensive to go to cons. I'd like to not have to shell out so much money to go.<br/><br/><b>To get money</b>: If there's a sliver of profit left after the prior requirement is met, it would be nice to have some more money to pay bills and get my kid birthday and Christmas presents and go out with my friends.<br/><br/>(PS: As far as I'm concerned, for the purposes of this thread, questioning people's answers is fine. Ideally I'd like to see people reserve their questions to genuine questions, not rhetorical inquiries designed to elicit a specific response or prove a point of view one might hold.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123758/#Comment_123758" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T11:59:17+00:00" title="February  1, 2008 11:59AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So that people will actually play my games.

Some folks think playing squirrels is weird, some think a Roman Empire that never fell due to magic kitchy but others think it is neat.

I'll try to add my own, though they're going to overlap with a lot of the others. These are sort of in order, but not really.<br/><br/>1. I have to create. When I think about gaming, I think about rules, and I create rules to do things I think would be interesting. When I think about books, I have to create pictures, borders, font/layout combinations, charts. When I think about stories, I have to creates rules that make that story happen, pictures that illustrate that story, and words to tell that story. <br/><br/>2. I want a game that does certain things I want to play, all of those things, together. I want a game that focuses on the things I want to focus on. I want a game that plays like a traditional game, but puts story power in the hands of the players. I don't want to keep playing games that are ALMOST perfect for me. I want to play a game that IS perfect for me. <br/><br/>3. I want to ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING. I have to confess to a bit of a self-esteem issue. I've never really set out on an ambitious project and worked all the way through it to completion. It's not that it's too hard and I quit, it's that I lose interest, or I start to think no one else is interested, so why bother? I want to change that, not just with a "look at this, isn't it neat?" online publish. I want something I can hold in my hands, show off to other people, and know that I made that thing. <br/><br/>4. I believe there are people out there who want the same thing in number 2 that I want. I want to give those people what they want. I want to know that other people are enjoying something I produced. This is connected to 3 as well, in that it will make the accomplishment more complete. <br/><br/>5. I'd like to earn something as a creator. I want to take my creative obsession and make it work for me, make it my profession. It doesn't have to be my tabletop RPG design that does it for me, either. That's why I'm learning to code, as well. <br/><br/>6. It's... fun. It's frustrating. It's educational.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123915/#Comment_123915" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T07:44:36+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  7:44AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>So that people will actually play my games.

I've got a number of reasons for wanting to publishing Criminal Element, most of which are very personal rather than a "sound business idea".  I want to publish Criminal Element because...<br/><br/>...there isn't another game like it out there right now.  <br/><br/>...I love the way a book feels in my hands.  <br/><br/>...no one else is going to publish this.  <br/><br/>...I won't let anyone else have my baby. <br/><br/>...I'm a "visually-minded" person and when I write I also think of layout, art direction, and ultimately what my creation would look like as a book.<br/><br/>...I want to create something that is an artifact containing my ideas, my writing, my artistic skills, all together.  <br/><br/>...I want to share this book about something I love with other people that love the same thing.  <br/><br/>And since we're on the subject of personal... I want to publish because someone I love more than I could ever say would have loved to see my book published. Now I see my book as another way to tell this woman how much I love her. <br/><br/>But, in the end I want to publish CE because I need to.  Because not publishing it and taking a risk on something I believe in would be a betrayal to myself.  Because I'm proud of this work that I've created and I want to see it all the way through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124692/#Comment_124692" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T20:16:00+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  8:16PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2008 8:16PM by JDCorley.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why the hell not, just click on 'Submit Post' and it's done?<br/><br/>Edit: Oops, "for sale."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sean2099" title="sean2099"><img alt="sean2099" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sean2099">sean2099</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124857/#Comment_124857" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-06T19:30:33+00:00" title="February  6, 2008  7:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to write and to put creative ideas on paper before I forget them.
