PROJECT OVERVIEW<br/>\nThe game you see before you is an outline of an educational simulation of industrial conflict in late nineteenth-century Australia.  I have chosen "Melbourne 1890" as its working title.  I intend to flesh out the details with data from a specific historical situation.  This will be chosen from the local history of any community this simulation may eventually be taught in, and I would encourage other educators or gamers to study their own local history before implementing any "vanilla" dispute.  I will, however, leave this title and any posts to this thread non-specific, partly to protect the anonymity of the students I may work with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am creating this project as a classroom resource to satisfy one of the requirements for my teaching degree.  It may or may not ever see "action."  It is intended as a radical teaching tool, both in its structure and content.  It is, first and foremost, a history lesson.  While some may argue about Marx's relevance to modern economies, his analysis has generally been accepted as valid for classical industrial scenarios.  Therefore, much of the maths behind the game were derived from his labour theory of value.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be opening myself to accusations of indoctrination, but if properly implemented this simulation will grant students a degree of autonomy and creative freedom that is inconsistent with "indoctrination."  No strategy is prescribed for either industrial leaders or their workers, though this simulation ought to be integrated into a wider curriculum that gives at least some historical knowledge on the period.  Nor would I hope for "simple" truths from anyone.  The post-game debate is meant to foster mutual sympathy and understanding, perhaps leading students to discuss modes of reconciliation that did not occur to them during the game.  Furthermore, while the core dynamic is one of labour vs capital, I have tried to include some more post-modern critiques by noting the inclusion women and Indigenous Australians in the game.  If the numbers of students are sufficient, the simulated town may include a rather broad middle class.  If resources allow, I would much prefer to see a complex and multifaceted community represented than a simple economistic cliche.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac" title="Bercilac"><img alt="Bercilac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac">Bercilac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196225/#Comment_196225" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T03:46:51+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  3:46AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            B.  THE SCENARIO<br/>\n<br/>\nThis outline taken from:<br/>\nMarsh, C. "Studies of Society and Environment: Exploring the Teaching Possibilities" 5th ed (Pearson Education Australia, Frenchs Forest NSW: 2008) 227.<br/>\n<br/>\n=Objectives=<br/>\nThrough roleplay, the students will negotiate strategies and explore meaning in an industrial community in Melbourne going through an economic crisis in the 1890s.<br/>\n<br/>\n=Scenario=<br/>\nAs Australian trade and communications flourished in the nineteenth century, a previously agrarian economy became a rapid industrialising one.  The workers were in some sense left behind by this progress, leading to emergence of a strong Labour movement that, in Melbourne, won the eight-hour day in the 1850s, led a series of strikes during the financial crisis of the 1890s, and elected Labour representatives to the first Federal parliament in 1901.  This simulation focusses on a small industrial community in the Melbourne area.  As the financial crisis works its effects on the price of living, wages, and employment, students will attempt to maintain their livelihood.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe town will be set up to include housing, a grocery store, a police station/jail/courthouse, houses for town officials and wealthy individuals, a factory, a union hall and a railroad.  Possible additions (depending on time and resources) could include a restaurant, a school, a doctor's office, and a church.<br/>\n<br/>\n=Roles=<br/>\nMinimum roles:<br/>\n1-3 factory managers<br/>\n10-15 workers<br/>\n2-3 policemen<br/>\n1 shopowner<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional roles (in no particular order of preference):<br/>\nMayor<br/>\nJudge<br/>\nDoctor<br/>\nPriest (or two: Catholic/Protestant sectarianism)<br/>\nTeacher<br/>\nUnion leader<br/>\n<br/>\nTeacher-supplied roles:<br/>\nAn accountant (helps managers with maths and prevents cheating on their part)<br/>\nPossibly want teachers to play police?<br/>\n<br/>\n=Role Profiles=<br/>\n<br/>\nFactory Managers<br/>\nOne will play the owner of the factory, any others will be foremen hired and paid by the owner.  The managers will be tasked with maintaining profits, procuring raw materials, selling their product on the market, overseeing production, and resolving disputes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorkers<br/>\nWorkers may be male or female; employed, unemployed, or engaged in paid or unpaid domestic labour; Protestant or Catholic; European or Indigenous; etc.  Some of these considerations will be affected by the size of the group, and composition will obviously affect the emphasis of the game.  Each will have a detailed description of their upbringing, circumstances, and recent work history.  They will perform factory labour; receive wages; spend it on food and housing; among other essentials, and sleep.  If the setting is expanded, some may work as cooks/waiters in the restaurant; shop assistants in the grocery store; or other functions around the town.  If there is a school, some will be young enough to go to school (though some of those will already be working).<br/>\n<br/>\nPolice<br/>\nThese students will draw and spend wages from the government; ensure order; and arrest legal violators.<br/>\n<br/>\nShopowner<br/>\nThis student will buy groceries from outside suppliers; stock their shop; set prices; and sell goods.<br/>\n<br/>\nMayor<br/>\nThis student, as a generic representation of the state, will oversee and advise or order the activities of the police, the judge, and the teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudge<br/>\nThis student will organise and oversee the trials and sentencing of those students under arrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoctor<br/>\nThis student will offer medical treatment, though obviously at professional prices.<br/>\n<br/>\nPriest<br/>\nThis student will be given a detailed description of their character's background and beliefs and will have to roleplay regular "sermons."  They will be encouraged to fill the benches!<br/>\n<br/>\nTeacher<br/>\nThis teacher will be given a list of "lessons" to teach in school.  They have to stick to pre-chosen topics and maximise attendence.  Remember, children who aren't at work may get harassed by the police unless they go to school, depending on Mayoral policy!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnion Leader<br/>\nThis student will be a worker, but with additional background elements and information concerning union activities.  I have included this as optional as it changes the nature of the game significantly.  Are students generating their own strategies, or are they learning about historical strategies?  Obviously, with or without the inclusion of a union leader, they will to some extent do a mix of both.  One thing to note is that the unions are employed, white, and craft-based.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac" title="Bercilac"><img alt="Bercilac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac">Bercilac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196226/#Comment_196226" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T03:47:13+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  3:47AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            =Role Interaction=<br/>\nInteractions proceed in three rotating phases.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Work<br/>\nEmployed workers enter the factory.  They will come equipped with green "energy" tokens.  In each of eight rounds, they will select either 1 (slack off), 2 (steady pace), or 3 (work hard) tokens.  They line up and one by one drop their counters into a large bucket (with a lid that conceals its contents).  In each of those rounds, each manager selects someone to oversee, by stopping them in line.  The "overseen" must reveal their choice of counters.  There is a second bucket in the factory with yellow "push" counters.  Anyone may draw from the "push" counters if they run out of green tokens, but their withdrawals are noted down, and they may only take one per round.  At the end each rounds, each worker makes an injury roll, a % chance which is increased if they took a "push" counter that round (perhaps from 2% to 10%?).  Any failed rolls result in an injury that effectively terminates their employment (either temporarilly if they receive proper treatment, or permanently).  The management then distributes the day's wages.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Eat<br/>\nAs the workers leave the factory, the managers have a job to do.  The day's bucket is then totalled up to determine the day's production.  This process is performed by the managers with the aid of their Teacher "accountant".  Yellow "push" counters accumulate to possibly reduce production, by shoddy or ruined work.  I may also introduce in some part of the scenario a small number of red "sabotage" counters which workers may dump in the bucket for a drastic chance and severely reducing production.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, the workers go and spend their money at the general store for food tickets.  These are taken home where anyone may "cook" them by exchanging them for green energy tokens.  Each cook must also expend 4 energy tokens to do this (Cooking rules are meant to introduce a feminist angle, by showing domestic work).  These tokens are then divied up (the "meal").  If one were to drop the domestic setting, the shop would merely provide green energy tokens, rather than food, providing an eerie "soylent green" effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis phase should be long, giving the workers time to socialise and discuss issues as well as simply consume their pay.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Sleep<br/>\nAny worker with a house must return to it and is delivered 2 green tokens.  Any worker in a tenement is delivered 1 green tokens by their landlord.<br/>\n<br/>\n=Procedures and Win Criteria=<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no "victory" per se.  This game will run for a set period of time during which pressures will mount that will almost certainly cause an industrial dispute.  To begin with, wages will begin barely above the subsitence level.  Inflation will set in (the prices of raw materials and bulk groceries will go up for managers and shop keepers respectively).  When the banking crisis hits, the managers will find their capital become suddenly very thinly stretched.  The managers will be in a situation that encourages them to either slash wages, demand a speed-up (any worker found slacking, one token, gets fired immediately), or lay off workers.  The workers will be in a situation that encourages them to seek job security, a safe work environment (the manager will have the option of investing in safety equipment), a slower pace at work, and better wages.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the time alloted to the simulation ends, there will be an extensive debrief including group discussions across (and now outside) roles, followed up by a written assignment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac" title="Bercilac"><img alt="Bercilac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac">Bercilac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196227/#Comment_196227" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T03:53:34+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  3:53AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *ADDITIONAL COMMENTS*<br/>\n<br/>\nI first posted this game on the Forge.  A few things have already arisen in that discussion, and I think it would be helpful to clarify them up front.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  The working day consistes of EIGHT ROUNDS, meaning that workers can be expected to average 16 energy tokens per day, but possibly anywhere between 8 and 24.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  The main "meat" of the game is unscripted interaction.  As systematic pressures (rising costs of living, falling wages, speed-ups at work) make the workers' situation untenable, they will be forced to think of innovative solutions to their problems.  That is where the real EDUCATIONAL content is.  As such, phase 2, eating, should really be "eating, recreation, and socialisation."  This is the time when students will discuss their problems at work and outside it and try and innovate solutions (drawing, to some extent, on previous lectures on the labour movement in general).<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Several commentators have suggested adding "morale" factors.  I want this to be played experientially, but I have taken their suggestions on board and intend to allow the shopkeeper to stock things like board games or footballs for rental, chocolates (provide no energy, but you can actually EAT them), or other small rewards or "luxuries" which will cue the players into their declining living standard before the Gamemaster/Teacher says "You've broken your leg at work and now you can't pay your rent."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac" title="Bercilac"><img alt="Bercilac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac">Bercilac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196228/#Comment_196228" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T03:54:03+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  3:54AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The discussion on the Forge:<br/>\nhttp://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27692.0                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196233/#Comment_196233" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T04:58:07+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  4:58AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2009 4:58AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What age student is this intended for?

Students won't have to know all of the nuts and bolts of the economy before playing, just their section (so there will probably be a special briefing for managers, who have the heftiest responsibilities in that regard).<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding your "break-down" factors,<br/>\nUnderpayment: that's the shopkeeper's job.  If it's not a mistake, then it's stealing and the police can get involved.<br/>\nCheating: apart from your "riot" scenario or trading energy tokens, that's actually part of the game.  Striking is cheating, as far as management is concerned.<br/>\nDon't give a damn: then I won't be doing my job.  You can't make the students care.  You can just try and make the best job of it you can, present your work, try to keep things moving, and leave the door open for participation.  Partly the students might be "screened" depending on whether it's given in a required or elective class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for bland and grim, that's kind of how I see the economy.  All of the things you think this game needs, I agree.  But it's the students' job to provide that.  A strike is a dynamic process, involving co-operation, teamwork, social skills, and so forth.  So my intention is to create a situation that facilitates those interactions, and hopefully fun, but it won't work unless the students buy into it and try and innovate themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for idle players, that's somewhat intentional.  There will be some recreational areas provided for those with the free time and money to participate.  I'm hoping this will lead to a social milieu that sees the "middle class" players talking to each other, discussing problems together, et cetera.  Believe me, students don't need any help being idle.  As for the police, yeah.  They basically get throw their weight around.  They could try and be "good cops" if they so choose, intervening in arguments, helping people who get lost or confused, and keeping the peace.  Or they could be "bad cops" imposing arbitrary "fines", harassing bystanders, et cetera.  The fun part for me will be watching how students interpret their roles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac" title="Bercilac"><img alt="Bercilac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac">Bercilac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196768/#Comment_196768" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T23:09:06+00:00" title="March 12, 2009 11:09PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple other thoughts on "idleness."<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm mostly worried about players playing women.  I don't want them to get the idea that women don't do serious work!  Unless I had lots of players as children, or added in some elements that could lead to messy households, they'll have the most idle time.  Of course, this won't be true if a strike kicks off.

Fun!<br/><br/>Seriously, I think most of the kids will understand alienation and boredom pretty well, as they experience it on a daily basis. They'll experience existential angst as soon as they get into the real workforce.<br/><br/>If I were trying to get this point across to my students, I'd try designing a narrative game that emulates the fiction of Upton Sinclair and Franz Kafka. Show them boredom and "the sickness unto death" in a fun, dramatic way. Maybe you could look at Jason's "Grey Ranks" or Paul Czege's "My Life with Master" for some inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
