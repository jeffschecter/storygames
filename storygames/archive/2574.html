About 10 items in all, from a variety of sources: sinister SS experiment reports from Natzweiler, RPA subject dossiers on disappearing generals, clandestine British intelligence factfiles, torn and worn letters found of the body of a GI on the banks of the Rhine and so on. The text in the items weaves truth and fiction together: sections from the Nuremberg Trials mixes with reports about Nazi dimensional gates to cold, dead worlds.<br/><br/>Rather than produce these as a book, Paul (my artistic creative partner in Contested ground Studios) and I are intent on hand-making a limited number of dossiers (30 of the things) in time-worn Manila folders, stained paper, rusted paper clips, treasury tags, fingerprints, coffee mug stains, blood splatters, wear and tear. All to make them look as authentic as possible.<br/><br/>To produce 30 it will be a fair amount of work, as each will be a unique item: the text will be the same in all of them, but the aging, wearing and marking will be subtly different in all 30. The time invested in producing them will not be recouped by sales. But then again, that isn't really the point. We're doing it because we want to produce something cool, that is not only useful for the game, but is an object in and of itself.<br/><br/>Is this sheer folly? Not just for Cold City, but do we (as in gamers) value such things as an object, not just for the inspiration a game item give or the story making enjoyment it can provide, but as a thing to leaf through, hold and use.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm<br/><br/>*Thinking back on it, Keith Senkowskis 'Untitled' at Gen Con 2006 must have sparked something off in my brain.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59026/#Comment_59026" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T11:06:10+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 11:06AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            as someone who has been pricing out rabit pelts and papyrus to print an almost totally superfluous "bonus editon" play aid for primitive i gotta say, its totally worth it.<br/><br/>I want this thing pretty fiercly.

I'd love to see a deluxe Primitive with all that stuff in a bundle. Would pay cash money for such an item!<br/><br/>This is the thing: I would buy such things myself, as I love the feel of such things, the ownership of a hand made itemthat has been crafted by someone who cares about such things.

Each individual piece will require a lot of work by two people (staining, cutting, pasting, marking, writing, weathering, wearing, coffee-mugging and so on!). At the moment, we're thinking of pricing it at the same price point as the book itself: somewhere in the 20 - 30 dollar range. PDFing the finished article was a route we were also intending to take, with appropriate reassurances to people that the 30 hand made versions will be the only physical, made by us ones in existence. Pricing will be something we need to consider very carefully.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I've thought along similar lines, and I agree that it would be a wonderful object.

I look at the price for that box and think "That's pretty good value for what it is". <br/><br/>Thanks for the comments on this. It was something we were always going to do, but it's nice to hear that the hand-made item is valued and appreciated in the community at large. It's certainly something I'd like to see much more of.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59052/#Comment_59052" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T12:29:56+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 12:29PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this sounds awesome.<br/><br/>It reminds me of when I was first playing D&amp;D and I'd grab my mom's word processing paper and toss it in vats of tea water so it would look aged before taking lighter to the edges for that ancient scroll look.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59094/#Comment_59094" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T14:21:11+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  2:21PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At this price range, I would certainly beinterested in one of the deluxe package (AND in the PDF so I could make additional props!)

I think Untitled is a great piece of work, but I one of those who are guilty of not giving it the attention it deserved at Gen Con.

General Hans Kammler is mentioned more than once, the Ahnenerbe make appearances and certain experiments seem to be referred to by a variety of sources.

I'm a bit disappointed they all sold though, as I wanted to pick one up at the end of the con!<br/><br/>If anything, I'd say at \xc2\xa320 you were selling yourself short. The work from both you and Paul that went into it was incredible - were you happy with \xc2\xa380 return for all that time and effort?<br/><br/>How much did the dossier go for in the charity auction? \xc2\xa3200 wasn't it?</blockquote>\nThanks Andrew.<br/><br/>Were we happy with the retuirn on our work? To be honest, I think the feedback and appreciation from other mattered more in the first instance. We were entirely unsure of how this would be received, what people would think of it and so forth, so the positive reaction (and the fact that it flew off the stall) was great.<br/><br/>The one in the charity auction went for \xc2\xa3220 (about $420).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Props are great, but what would really be cool is selling a gamer-oriented "distressing kit" with some 'source material' PDFs. Scrapbookers' versions go for 20-40 dollars.</blockquote>\nHim, for that we'd need to include teabags, coffee granules, a variety of paints, a mug, a small oven, lots of water, box of matches, grease and various other bits and bobs! I wonder what customs and excise would think of that?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Fredzor</cite>I was not aware that they were that limited, or I would have seized the moment and grabbed one while I had the chance. As it was, when I got around to picking up my copy of Cold City, they were all gone. Curses.</blockquote>\nThere will be more available in the near future (once Paul has a couple of commission pieces out of the way), but we'll only ever be doing 30, so that's another 25 to go. We'll also be doing the PDF in the near future as well, that will feature scans of the proper documents and un-distressed versions in B&amp;W that will be easier and less ink-intensive to print.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>Sigh.

I understand that in dolar terms, the price is quite high, but with the time and materials involved, it's hard to justify anything lower. Weirdly, some people commented that they actually thought \xc2\xa320 was quite a low price point and we could have still sold all the copies we had at \xc2\xa325 or higher. Which amazed me.
