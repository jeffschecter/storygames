It's very fun as it allows me to mess with things when I want to mess with things (which is always).<br/><br/>But just for kicks, I've recently started playing the most do-goody character I could possibly think of: a fourteen year old kid who travels around the postapocalyptic wastelands and tries to make life better for the people in it... using words! He is completelly, unproblematically, a good person - he wants good things happen to people, and he uses non-violent means to bring that about. He helps people set aside their differences and work in unison for a better tomorrow. And doing this has been ridiculously fun!<br/><br/>I find that surprising, as I was somewhat expecting to choke on all the self-produced sugary-sweet moments in a session or two. Now, there ARE moments worthy of an afternoon special (talking a mutant chieftain out from enacting his terrible vengeance on the 'pure' humans who abused his people), but they don't seem strange or mind-numbingly moralistic when they happen. Good people (with no tragic flaws whatsoever!) can be surprisingly interesting!<br/><br/>I have a few suspicions on why I'm enjoying this play as much as I am, but before I talk about that, I'd like people to share their experiences with playing good characters straight...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Some stuff I expected to come up has come up, too: that playing good people who are flawed is fun, and that it's fun to explore what exactly it means to be a good person in the first place.<br/><br/>But my character wasn't about that at all. He was a clearcut, stereotypical goodie-two-shoes. He has no character flaws whatsoever, and I've done absolutelly no exploration of what it means to be a good person. And yet, I don't feel like I'm droning through a morality tale as the main character who is destined to overcome all odds. And I'm having fun!<br/><br/>What the character does confront in the game is, uh, technical issues of goodness - we're playing Apocalypse World, so the world is a dreary and nasty place, and the people that live in it... Don't take all that kindly to sweet-talk. So my character has problems convincing them of the merits of good-ness, he has troubles maintaining his face when his actions are misread as hostile, and he's losing opportunities and getting into trouble on account of his code.<br/><br/>It really makes me realize that being a good person is not a cakewalk at all. It's a damned difficult thing to manage, and you are definitelly not guaranteed to win out in the end. On top of that, there's no guarantee that all of those sacrifices you make, big and small, will ever actually amount to anything good. So you stop the squabbling between the mutant tribes - but now they want revenge on the humans. So you convince them not to devolve into mindless slaughter - but that only makes them possible targets for the humans.<br/><br/>Being good is difficult business!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257066/#Comment_257066" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T06:12:56+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  6:12AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cynicism is the same emotional armor gamers have been strapping on since the first orphaned loner sat by himself in the bar with his back to the wall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257071/#Comment_257071" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T07:08:23+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  7:08AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think introducing a super good character in a game is very dependent on the game thats going to be played. <br/><br/>For example my group decided for one of our games that we just felt like strapping on our stomping boots and mucking about as mercenaries for hire.

You go through some mess to do it, but you can eventually succeed. Then, Mr. Tenpenny winds up dead, and the head ghoul just cracks a joke. Okay, Mr. Tenpenny is a bastard, but damnit, I worked hard to do this bloodlessly! I blew the farker away.. But I let the rest of the ghouls live. Until I come back later, and find all the humans dead, and the ghouls living unconcernedly on, seemingly "just folks". Just folks who murdered their human neighbors. The humans were the 'racist' scum, damnit! The ghouls were the victims who just wanted to coexist peacefully!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be needless to say it, but I went on a murderous rampage that the game considered very bad for my karma. My "Paragon" occasionally stops by to make sure he didn't miss one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(END SPOILER)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing good in a nasty setting is harder than being nasty or at least cynical, for certain. I do enjoy it as a rule though, as I've enough of an idealist in me to wish that Good always triumphed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257143/#Comment_257143" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T19:59:18+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  7:59PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We recently started a semiannual Burning Wheel campaign using the Blossoms Are Falling supplement. I'm playing Oe Daisuke, a young fallen bushi who was disgraced and dishonored when he fell in love with the same woman his lord was in love with and refused to cede his love to his lord. Basically my lord ordered me to commit suicide and I refused for love.<br><br>Mechanically, that means I have the No Face trait, which means that my Honor started at zero and my Shame started at a frighteningly high 7.<br><br>I want to see this character redeem himself in the eyes of his culture! To do so, I have to advance my Honor to at least 4 and get the other players to vote off the No Face trait. If that happens, then I can get a new lord. I'll still have to go into Honor Debt because my Shame would be higher than my Honor (for every point your Shame exceeds your Honor, you have to use a Belief to swear an onerous oath to your lord or be forced to commit suicide to atone for your shame).<br><br>To represent my ambition for the character, he's got a belief about redeeming himself before his ancestors. But to give it a little spice and complexity, he's also got a belief about finding a way to be with the woman he loves. I suspect it will be impossible to fulfill both, but it's going to be fun trying!<br><br>All this puts me in a very interesting position. Honor in Blossoms includes the concept of personal honor, but more importantly it is about subjecting yourself utterly to your lord's orders. Often the lord's orders will be personally shameful (earning you tests toward advancing Shame), but also highly honorable in terms of serving your lord (and thus earning you tests toward advancing Honor). For instance, a bushi who would divorce his wife so his lord could marry her, or who would execute his own father because his lord demands it, would be considered highly honorable.<br><br>Because my character is fallen and has no lord currently, he is able to serve his personal honor without performing shameful deeds unless he chooses to do so. <br><br>The high Shame attribute sits there and tempts me. Mechanically, if I am performing an act that the rest of the players at the table deem shameful, I can use a Persona point to use my Shame as my dice for the action! But that earns me tests toward advancing Shame.<br><br>But so far I'm resisting the temptation. Even though I have the highest Shame and lowest Honor of the other characters in the group who have Honor and Shame, I behave the most honorably. He's a character that could totally be the antisocial loner. But because he seeks to redeem himself, he must be utterly humble and heroic.<br><br>I'm really loving this character. He's unabashedly good in terms of our modern, neoclassical liberal sensibilities, but still an incredibly complex and interesting character.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257146/#Comment_257146" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T21:14:24+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  9:14PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2010 9:15PM by Keith Sears.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;It was a fun but challenging character to play, and a nice move away from the traditional cloaked badass lone wolf assassin types that D&amp;D; often generates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think you can lay this at D&amp;D;'s door.
