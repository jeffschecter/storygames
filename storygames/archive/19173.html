I don't play D&amp;D anymore but I play on the shoulders of giants. So, I raise a glass in remembrance of the fallen: my first character, a hobbit (before they were purged from the system) who died by the rusty sword of an animated skeleton in his very first combat.

It was a one-on-one game, and my character was a high-level fighter who started play with a whole bunch of magic items. I fought and killed a dragon (can't remember the colour, but it was a BIG one).<br/><br/>The biggest problem was: how do I carry all this loot home with me? I settled on packing a bunch of gold into my tent, which really impressed the DM.

It was an enigma shrouded in a mystery, until a friend of mine introduced me to the hobby. But then it would take me a few more years to finally experience the game. My first character was a half orc, who later become a dragon disciple and had an unfair death at the hands of a random-encounter river naga, who wasn't supposed to be able to cast meteor shower in the way she did, turning an otherwise time-wasting scene into a TPK. Blame the GM, I can't have fun playing D&amp;D since that anymore. But also, I haven't been able to stop playing RPGs anymore, even if I have to hack them over and over until I get a version I can play without stressing so much.<br/><br/>I'm definitely gonna hack/make my own old school game soon. Perhaps I'll play a half-orc again with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427717/#Comment_427717" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-28T07:40:42+00:00" title="January 28, 2014  7:40AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, we had a special anniversary session on Sunday for this. To celebrate, the participants prepped One Page Dungeons that we sorted and played. In actual practice we ended up playing mine, as it was the most prepared. Pretty fun getting to GM for a change, as I've been mostly been a player lately in our local campaign.<br/><br/>Here's the best bit of the night: the party, consisting of 0-1 level farmboys and hopefuls, has journeyed 4 days into the wilderness in the midst of winter to seek the secret treasure stash of a local ranger who passed away recently. Peitsa's character Marius, the 5th son of a local landowner, is setting traps with his loyal farmhand, when he spies a rune painted in yellow on a big rock on the river bank; the rune's location and type match the treasure map the party is following. There is a hole under the rock, the natural sort you get in a rockfield or rocky riverbank where the rocks pile up on top of each other.<br/><br/>So Marius sees this big rock, weighting perhaps 500 pounds, and the hole below. He's suspicious of holes; Peitsa has only been playing rpgs for a few years, but I've taught him myself in the ways of D&amp;D, so he's naturally suspicious of something like that. He prods at the hole with a pole, observes that it's only <i>just</i> big enough for a slim man to crawl through; furthermore, there are some solid, movable objects within the hole, which would indicate that water hasn't gotten in (it's January, the weather's been freezing for weeks in the area). The hole slopes down in a manner that makes it impossible to observe the inside, even with light. After some hemming and hawing Marius decides to crawl in there to investigate, encouraged by my assurances that the geometry seems to be of the sort where he can probably reach whatever the objects inside are without having to go too far in - pushing himself halfway in there should be plenty.<br/><br/>The thing is, that big rock, it's been maliciously propped up so that it'll lean over pretty easily, should anybody give it a push from below. A simple, elegant thing, worthy of the ranger whose spoor the party is supposed to be investigating. This sort of trap isn't fool-proof, so it'd be 50% chance that Marius wouldn't trip the rock on top of himself in the summer; in the winter the situation is even better for Marius, as frozen earth and water might well prevent the rock from tipping; I give it a 1/6 for the rock to tip.<br/><br/>As it happens, the rock <i>does</i> fall on top of poor Marius, who realizes too late that the earth is shifting. Air is pushed out of his lungs by the <i>crushing</i> pressure as the rock settles, partially on top of him, with its end resting around his tailbone as he rests there, halfway swallowed by the ground. Marius can hardly breath, but he wriggles and manages to shout for his faithful companion to go seek the rest of the party for help.<br/><br/>The party is half an hour coming, and Marius can hardly feel his legs in the cold. He can only barely breathe. He gropes about in the dark, and gets his hands on the objects that he felt with his pole earlier; they're round stones, about a hand wide. Marius hits and scrapes at the ground right below his ribcage, the only place around him where there's loose earth and not just rock, hoping that he could loosen up the soil and make space for his ribcage, perhaps even sufficient room to crawl out from under the rock. The earth is frozen too solid for him to make much headway. He doesn't stop trying, though, until a faint forces him to catch what breath he can.<br/><br/>(That above spot is where you divide the mediocre dungeonistas from the good ones: in a desperate situation Peitsa had a perfectly reasonable tactical idea for survival, and he sold it naturally to us. Had the dice gone the other way, that might have been key to success.)<br/><br/>The rest of the party arrives after half an hour, and they waste little time cutting and shaping some slim trees into improvised levers they can use to lift the weight of the rock that's crushing Marius. Nobody's even sure if he's alive down there, as he isn't kicking, and doesn't have the breath to scream. Unfortunately the slippery, cold equipment is difficult to handle, or the party misjudges the situation, and their efforts go disastrously wrong: the rock moves, but instead of being lifted equally on both sides, it twists as one side gives way, turning in place almost 90 degrees, settling its full weight down on top of Marius's left arm and flank.<br/><br/>The party continues working, but it's evident that they would have to sledge back the corpse of this fine young lad, and explain to his parents how the poor boy met his end on this insensible quest for some supposed treasure in the back of beyond. To add insult to the injury: before the party finally leaves the Flint Hills behind several days later, Marius's poorly treated corpse endures a further indignity, as one of those skin-demons from <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19143/" rel="nofollow">J\xfcrgen's thread a couple days back</a> happens along, skins and steals Marius's entire epidermis while the party is out searching for the treasure. (I generally speaking never run bare one-shot adventures, so I had the <i>Cult of the Skin-Demon</i> as back-up and expansive material, in case the players would bounce away from my adventure. It thus obviously informed the random encounters during the session.)<br/><br/>In summation: I killed a player character with nothing more than an unsteady rock and a dash of paint. Talking of minimalist traps in all their simplicity, that <i>has</i> to be pretty exceptional. (That counts as a trap because it'd been set up with this specific outcome in mind.) The entire adventure was very strong in this minimalistic naturalism, and we had fun, so I consider it a jubilee well spent.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427722/#Comment_427722" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-28T09:12:03+00:00" title="January 28, 2014  9:12AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played Torchbearer.
