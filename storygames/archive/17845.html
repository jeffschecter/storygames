If someone with better forum-fu than me could find the old threads and link them, that'd be great.<br/><br/>So, the quality of the GM / facilitator is probably the single most important factor in whether or not an RPG session will be an overall positive experience. But, the reasons why it's hard to get paid to GM are manifold and manifest:<br/><br/>1) Subjectivity \u2014 this is a problem for any form of performance art, but especially so with RPGs, where even the understanding of basic definitions and motivations is so controversial.<br/><br/>2) Lack of reproducibility. Again, this is true of any sort of performance, but most other arts and most other forms of facilitation have recognized credentialing or degree programs or what have you.<br/><br/>3) The sketch factor of paying/getting paid for what is supposed to be a purely social experience.<br/><br/>4) Relatedly, no established vector for marketing GMing services. (In particular, there's no way gaming <i>companies</i> would pay for this sort of thing... right? They make their money by selling books, minis, etc.)<br/><br/>5) Despite the importance of the GM role, the prominence of other factors in determining whether or not a session will be fun. Even if I could control for system content and only run games I like, there's still the issue of disruptive players, or even players who are just tired/cranky. (This may be the most important one!)<br/><br/>Still, there are some people who've done it successfully, and we definitely already have established traditions of GMs getting into cons for free, and many groups will, for example, play for the GM's pizza. Many groups here in NYC are happy to pay $10-15 / session for use of the upstairs in an eatery, though they also get the benefit of the food. My point is that it's not completely crazy... right?<br/><br/>Anyway, am thinking about giving it a shot, if only by posting in "Lessons" on Craigslist, since I have a fair amount of free time on my hands right now. Would love help crafting the ad. Am definitely going to include my "real-life" i.e. non-gaming credentials (I am a professional educator, went to an Ivy League school, etc.). I want to promote the idea, in addition to simply running sessions, of helping people get their own campaigns off the ground\u2014"teaching people to fish" etc. Also, feedback surveys, in order to get testimonials!<br/><br/>Goals:<br/>-Will run for adults or teens or kids, but I don't want to run for huge hordes like Tavis does. ;-)<br/>-Run full sessions, not demos\u2014at least two hours of play time.<br/>-Set the hourly rate low, build up a client base. Was thinking about charging per player, but there are some perverse incentives here. Something like $5/hour/player for the first four players, $10/hour/player for players five and six.<br/><br/>And no, I'm not going to wear a mask. :-)<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatthewJHanson" title="MatthewJHanson"><img alt="MatthewJHanson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatthewJHanson">MatthewJHanson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403804/#Comment_403804" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T08:11:31+00:00" title="January 16, 2013  8:11AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the real problem is that you're competing with hundreds of people who will do it for free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403805/#Comment_403805" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T08:18:05+00:00" title="January 16, 2013  8:18AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm skeptical as to whether or not you could make a solid living off of this unless you live with roommates and in a big city with plenty of gamers and money to go around, but overall I don't think you're crazy.

The disadvantage is that you'll lose the people who are looking for entertainment (they won't want a "course"), while the advantage is that it's not at all weird to pay for a course on something, even a frivolous hobby you want to become better at.<br/><br/>The actual content of what you do wouldn't need to change at all here, even. Compare with say Judo: a Judo teacher is often paid because his pastime is characterized as a course or club activity. If the Judo teacher asked you to pay to "do Judo with him", that wouldn't go over nearly as well, even if what actually happens during the session is exactly the same either way.<br/><br/>This approach would be easier if you got in touch with some institution that arranges courses and clubs on hobbies. Here in Finland that would be "kansalaisopisto" or community college. Having your hobby club listed with them gives you instant credibility as a community college teacher on your topic, at least around here. Also, your activity will be considered a good thing for the community instead of money-grubbing. Of course, at least here the payments for doing courses through organizations like this are pretty standardized, so you wouldn't get an opportunity to set your own fees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BRennekamp" title="BRennekamp"><img alt="BRennekamp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BRennekamp">BRennekamp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403813/#Comment_403813" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T09:09:51+00:00" title="January 16, 2013  9:09AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Still, there are some people who've done it successfully</blockquote>\nThere has? Everytime I see this pop up on forums and various places, it usually gets dismissed out of hand pretty quickly. Can you give some examples of success?<br/><br/>Honestly, I could see companies like Wizards or Paizo hiring out for "Pro GMs" if you could concretely demonstrate to the right people that your costs are less than their current costs. I could also see potential service with Game Stores, if you could move product for them. Finally, another that comes to mind would be a group that wants to be run through classic scenarios that they have heard so much about, but don't have access to. Things like D&amp;D "Against the Giants" series or whatever. <br/><br/>I think it's an uphill battle in all of those cases though, as the perception is that you are offering something that is normally free. This happens in commercial spaces sometimes, but not often (bottled water comes to mind).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403814/#Comment_403814" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T09:12:11+00:00" title="January 16, 2013  9:12AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me and a group of GMs from a local gaming society have got together and done convention talks(At non-gaming but nerd/nerd-affiliate culture cons) along a similar line to what Eero has just mentioned, about running and getting into RPGs, finding a group and preparing your first session, along with common problems from players, systems and life that occur.

Never mind competing with GM's who are 'for free'. I've played with some GM's who were free and suddenly realised I was stuck there for some hours with a game I just wasn't into at all. Anyone who values their own time and enjoyment doesn't think free beats paid. A listing of past actual plays is very useful - just make sure your games actually follow. Don't list a swashbuckling game account, then run a dark and gritty everyone dies every five minutes game after.<br/><br/>Also perhaps buy some figures (perhaps the pathfinder ones) and, after taking this into account in your fee's, hand one out to each participant at the end. State this in your pitch. Something tangible gained in exchange for money also encourages people.<br/><br/>On <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, people tell jokes as a purely social experience. And stand up comedians get paid. The difference is that in the social experience you can tell jokes that just die and that's fine. It's not so much that it's a social experience, but more that you will be on the end of something which may be largely unforgiving.

I'd really want concrete specifics about what the GM could do for the benefit of <b>me</b> and <b>my group</b>.  Tell me what I'm paying for.<br/><br/>If I were promoting myself as a GM, I'd be sure to identify some different play styles and the different things I could offer them.  I might say "I like running deeply immersive games, and I also like running spontaneous creative games with tons of freedom.  Here's what I bring to each of those:" and then have two lists of bullet points.  (I might also include some intro about bringing positive energy and helping ensure that everyone gets to contribute or something, but I'd keep that brief.)  Or, I might do two separate ads, one focused on immersive play and the other on freewheeling spitballing improv.<br/><br/>Matt, I know your GMing range is pretty broad, but I imagine you can probably hone in on some particular niches where you can fill a demand.  <br/><br/>This is a cool idea, and I hope it pans out!

Running six groups a week currently, each for sessions 2 hours and 15 minutes. Some of my experiences may help you.<br/><br/>Here's my penny ...<br/><br/>First; get a good game! <br/>- It should be much more effective in feeding the fiction than most classical game are ("more effective" = faster, easier to "read").<br/>- It should be simple to run, as in; lets you make scenarios on the spot (preferably).<br/><b>The One Ring</b> may work, if streamlined a bit, and may be enticing to fans of <i>The Hobbit</i> ...<br/><br/>Getting started is a challenge; no one wants to pay for something they don't know about, so you may have to buy yourself a market; make the price less of a threshold (cheap the first season, and then increase to an acceptable pay, as the players get fired up). <br/><br/>Location is important; you are better off playing in free locales. I started up in after-school clubs (using classrooms for free), then privately (using around the kitchen table, in rich homes), and nowadays in a cultural centre for youths (using their premises for free). Paying for the venue cuts a large piece of the cake ...<br/><br/>It is easier to sell this to children, parents paying. In my experience it is OK to start off with 9-10 year olds, and most fun to play with those 11-13, and sometimes hilarious with the older youths (14-19), depending on the dynamics you are able to create in the groups.<br/><br/>Have some more to say on this.

You will get young and inexperienced players, and need to be helpful to make game-play fun for them; RPGs have some codes which is hard for some to crack; give them time by being patient and helpful as game-play proceeds<br/><br/>- do NOT use a GM-screen; it detracts from your communication with the players, and anything you could put on it may be put on the table, or in a chair beside it<br/>- put a game-sheet before you on the table. Draw a large square on it for the table, names of players outside the square (as they sit around the table), and names of characters inside it, all in BIG letters; use it to note names of important NPCs too, at your end of the sheet, to help yourself in game-play<br/>- be sure to write down what happens during each session, on the back of the game-sheet; it makes it easier for you to keep track of the fictions in different groups<br/>- read your notes aloud at the beginning of every session, to remind players where they are and what is happening; invite players to correct whatever you got wrong<br/><br/>- let game-play build and develop in liege with player initiatives, but be not afraid to make your mark on the fiction; look for dramatic opportunities all the time<br/>- have fun!<br/><br/>- use the alarm on your bright new and shiny smart-phone to keep time, so you may engulf in the sessions as a focused and engaged GM <br/><br/>- invite players to laugh a lot, and invite them to be serious and focused too. A good mixture will earn you their friendship, gratitude and respect.

People spend a lot of posting time discussing that in these topics, but to me it seems that it's difficult to measure something like whether you're a "better" GM than the other guy who does it for free. It's always going to depend on personal chemistry and the choice of games more than some hypothetical GMing skill that could be developed and proven by having a lot of nerd credentials. (Really, how much of the discussion around this topic is really about the biggest nerd penis?)<br/><br/>What is it that people would pay for, then? The two values I would expect to be money-worthy are a solid social space for play (both physical space and a good schedule), and an active and committed group to play with. The quality of the organizator/GM is a third value, but it's ultimately just a secondary concern that supports the first two: if you could arrange say four other people who were motivated to play the same game I was, and a convenient social space for us to play in, I could pay you for that even if you didn't play yourself.<br/><br/>A lot of ink has been spilled over whether being paid to GM actually decreases the quality of the experience, so it seems important to turn that aspect of the experiment into a strength. One way to view this is that having players pay for the experience means that they should be more committed to play, and therefore the session could be better than some game where the players are there just because they're friends and they have to be.<br/><br/>A scenario that's often bandied about in this context is one where a group of players hires the prospective pro-GM to run the game for them. I don't think that's realistic at all; if you already have a group, you've already got half of the above value equation covered. Most roleplayers probably are able to take on the GM role if the game happening depends on that, I would expect. For this reason I'd say that it's important for you to focus on matchmaking - building a group out of separate strangers - than assuming that some conveniently-sized group of friends wants to bring you in.<br/><br/>As Tomas says, the play space is crucial, and potentially expensive. Invent a good solution to that, and make the social space good as well: maybe your game runs weekly like clockwork at a specific time, regardless of the usual scheduling ballet - even that's worth something to gamers who're used to having to dance around every other possible social commitment every other player could have in their lives. (Really, it often seems that 95% of roleplayers consider the game-night the least important thing they could be doing. Anything else will have priority.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403863/#Comment_403863" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T01:23:00+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  1:23AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2013 1:24AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> You can currently attend Character Workshops if you wanted to do some of that though.

Most roleplayers probably are able to take on the GM role if the game happening depends on that, I would expect. For this reason I'd say that it's important for you to focus on matchmaking - building a group out of separate strangers - than assuming that some conveniently-sized group of friends wants to bring you in.</blockquote>\nI think this is a little bit glib. I've met a solid 30-40 roleplayers in the local community over the last four years at game nights and board game events who would "love to play", but "our GM left" and nobody wants to do the job of GMing (the game they want to play.)  And this ain't a huge community. Now whether this translates into a demand in the financial sense, I don't know.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403879/#Comment_403879" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T07:02:24+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  7:02AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What JD said.

I've never met the woman personally, but I've heard a lot second-hand. <br/>-She's run it for at least 8 years <br/>-She uses some home-brewed system that seems to be similar to D&amp;D 2/3/3.5.<br/>-Parents pay for their kids to have "character-building" and "creativity exploration" and because it's a safe and known space.<br/>-The kids (ages 10-14 mostly) come because they can play games with their friends after school and on the weekends. And they get to hang out at the comic book shop while they wait for their parents to pick them up.<br/><br/>So is she being paid as a GM? Well, yes...technically. But in reality, she's providing a much different service. Especially from the perspective of the parents, who are footing the bill.<br/><br/>And as an aside, the big game companies don't pay cash for GMs, but they definitely give bennies like rules sneak peeks and game tchotchkes to the GMs who run games at their sponsored events. That is considered "semi-pro" in that you are compensated, but not with case. Similar to say a skateboarder or a bicyclist who is sponsored by a company and gets free or discounted gear, but is not paid as an employee.<br/><br/>To just be a GM who is going to walk into someone's house and expect to be paid money by the players, I think you would need to be added much more value to the experience. Compare it to someone who comes to your house to show you and your friends how to cook dinner and/or taste wines. People pay for that because it's not perceived as an easily accessible skill set. And it's fun and social and they are bringing an "expert" in to show off to their friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403901/#Comment_403901" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T09:40:26+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  9:40AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A wine-tasting event might actually be a funny social model for this.

They are sacrificing the fees from one person to help put other butts in the seats. Heck, even the EndGame Oakland minicons will give GMs $5 in store credit for running a game. That may be worth $5 to you if you shop there, but it doesn't cost them $5.<br/><br/>Luke may sell a lot of books from his GMing and demoing.

If so, I think you have a pretty good shot. <br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Are you hoping to monetize something you already do anyway? If so, I think you have a lot of better options, including: daydreaming about entertaining business propositions, posting on craigslist, talking to people about your ivy league experiences.<br/><br/>I think there's probably some decent comparisons to be made to freelance web development for small businesses.<br/><br/>Freelance web development targeting small businesses is tough because a lot of unqualified people offer to do the work for a very low price, and small businesses have fewer options than larger businesses in determining who's a good cheap freelance web developer and who is not.<br/><br/>The (very moderately) successful freelance web developers targeting small businesses I'm aware of can make money because they A) have an existing network of people who only want to hire people they know, and/or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> market their services around new, eye-grabbing technology, like 'apps' and 'html5' were awhile ago. <br/><br/>In any case, if someone is capable of being a freelance web developer targeting small buisnesses and making good first world money, they are probably capable of making a lot more money doing something else just as easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Time for another discussion on professionalization of GMing - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17845/time-for-another-discussion-on-professionalization-of-gming/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Time for another discussion on professionalization of GMing - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17845/time-for-another-discussion-on-professionalization-of-gming/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Great point!

What games do you think do the best job of encouraging the players to work as a team to overcome obstacles?</blockquote>\nwww.starshipvalkyrie.com<br/><br/>The website is crap right now, but he's spending the next several months finishing an overhaul of the rulebook, which he's then intending to publish, as far as I know.<br/><br/>It's a work-together sci fi larp in a setting that is about 75% Star Trek and 25% Battlestar Galactica. For about 12-20 players at a time with about 3-4 people GMing and playing NPCs (or more, if you've got em).<br/><br/>And it's the most amazing leadership training / teambuilding exercise / communication simulation type thing I've ever done. It creates a tense but fun situation where good leadership technique really matters, but with an abstract gamey situation that makes it easier to analyze where things are going well and where they are breaking down.<br/><br/>With just the tiniest bit of work to add in actual technique training and reflection, it would be a really neat corporate teambuilding product.<br/><br/>I've spent 7 game sessions now as the captain of one of the ships, and it's been amazing to see how much a team of empowered subgroups can accomplish when given positive, supportive, and minimalist guidance. More than half the captaining work I do is in selecting who is going to be invited to play on my ship in the first place and talking to people outside of the game sessions to get everyone on the same page upfront. During the games, I tend to have my XO and Tactical Officer make most of the decisions, while I supervise and occasionally give a little nudge here and there. Trying out leadership techniques in a low-consequence environment has given me tremendous confidence in my ability to lead in the workplace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404295/#Comment_404295" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T01:29:35+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  1:29AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, just a side mention, but a musical group called tripod did 'tripod vs the dragon' <br/><a href="http://www.australianstage.com.au/201004013351/reviews/micf-10/tripod-vs-the-dragon.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.australianstage.com.au/201004013351/reviews/micf-10/tripod-vs-the-dragon.html</a><br/><br/>And these guys did a show where they GM a bunch of random comedians from the local area through a fairly silly dungeon.

Ironically I'd suggest, if you can stand to, putting out material (without busting a gut to do so) on a regular basis, sans advertising - that way slave wages aren't legitimised. Once you get a bulk of material, put adverts up for set periods of time then take them down again, using any funds raised by that to pay for the content you bust a gut to make (and put that in a seperate spot with ads on all the time). Put up the adverts only periodically. If the adverts pay for content creation, eventually that contents ads will pay for more content. Then you've a going concern.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404724/#Comment_404724" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-27T02:28:38+00:00" title="January 27, 2013  2:28AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The penny arcade podcast got a boost from those people already having a following. The same way the show Table Top gets a boost from having Wil Wheaten as a host and guest stars each week. if your games are good enough that you think someone would pay to play in them then they are good enough to attract people that have followings to play in them. There are many ways to get your content noticed working with estabished followings is just one of them.<br/><br/>Any job entertaining people is going to be hard to make work.<br/><br/>As for being a GM for Profit well there are people who do things like that. for example Lone Shark Games ran by Mike Selinker actually worked on the stage productions for the penny arcade podcast but he also does party planing, trivia events and booth events for trade shows. so basically client work, that sort of business also takes a lifetime to build but i rarely see Mike frown about it.<br/><br/>anyway entertainment work is not for sensible people.

Figure out which guest stars you can afford, and who will play that much to play in a game. Do it at conventions, if you're smart. Big pool of potential customers there, and hotels for guests. Maybe auction the seats to the highest bidder (with a reserve).<br/><br/>Another idea. Run games online and charge real money for them. Not much, but a few bucks a session. Run games _all the freaking time_. Make money that way.<br/><br/>Best idea. Make money writing games or supplements. Use your GM skills to make material that other people will pay for.

I'd suggest putting together an awesome Dungeon World one-shot that you can roll out and get people playing almost instantly. And prepare some bachelor-party content, like a drinking contest at the tavern (real-life chugging) and a sexy succubus and a nagging annoying princess and stuff like that. Have several ideas planned, so you can tailor it to the feel of the group. Put together a questionnaire you can give to the best man to help you customize the adventure.<br/><br/>Also - you are presumably extremely location-dependent. You reference New York a little, so I assume that's where you're based. But that's the number one thing to be clear about on the web site. The VERY FIRST thing someone needs to know if they came across your site by browsing and not by a location-dependent reference (a referral or a game store advertisement or something) is whether or not you are close enough that you would consider coming to their place. <br/><br/>It should be SUPER obvious where you are located. Like to the point where the line that says "A topnotch WordPress.com site" should say "Roleplaying in Queens and Brooklyn New York" or something like that. (I know nothing about New York geography - my apologies if that sounds crazy obviously lame.)<br/><br/>The second thing someone would potentially want to know, which is almost the same as the first thing, is do you host or have a place available to host a game. For many people who don't already have a game going, availability of a good location to play is one of the reasons they are not already playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411309/#Comment_411309" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-04T13:55:51+00:00" title="April  4, 2013  1:55PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out of curiosity, how profitable is this concept?

Figure out what you want to make and then name that number from step 1. You can always offer promotional pricing or cut a deal, but it's hard to raise prices once you're up and running, since you'll be the first person setting expectations.<br/><br/>Think ahead about pricing for add-ons. What happens if, at hour 4, people want to keep playing? Is there an upcharge? Are there limits? Will you have pricing designed to discourage certain behaviors? Sounds dumb at first, but do you really want to end up in a twelve hour session? You might want to think ahead about that. <br/><br/>Hell, how much would you charge for hours 6-12? $100/hr for those add-ons? Maybe, under the right circumstances.<br/><br/>Poke around and find out what other service jobs cost in your area. How much do birthday clowns charge? Face painters? Fortune tellers? Again, sounds dumb at first, but those are closer to what you're proposing than other sorts of jobs. It will give you more of an idea of what you should be considering and what other people are paying, even if it isn't an exact fit with being a roving mercenary GM!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411377/#Comment_411377" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-05T08:53:38+00:00" title="April  5, 2013  8:53AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What happens if, at hour 4, people want to keep playing?

Or a slight, quick fee announce, usually modest.<br/><br/>At the next point, suddenly prices tend to go up steeply. It's meant as a sign that this is only going to happen if you've got cash, a lot of it, in your pocket then and there. You're actively telling them, sorry it's over unless you're truly crazy enough to lay down some serious cash, in advance. That's where my comment about $100/hr for hours 6-12 came from.<br/><br/>Who knows? At an all night Bachelor Party D&amp;D session with a bunch of geeky old college buddies who haven't gotten together for a long time, somebody might do it. Still cheaper than several hours in the VIP lounge of your local upmarket strip club, and a whole lot easier to explain to your fianc\xe9e and soon to be in-laws ( especially your new brother in law who is at the party!).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411561/#Comment_411561" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T09:44:19+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  9:44AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff, keep it coming!<br/><br/>Still need images and testimonials!<br/><br/>Thanks all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411581/#Comment_411581" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T11:51:53+00:00" title="April  8, 2013 11:51AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://imgur.com/s2Mrqdx" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/s2Mrqdx.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com"/></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411582/#Comment_411582" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T12:03:56+00:00" title="April  8, 2013 12:03PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LOL!
