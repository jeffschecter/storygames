                    Okay, I'm hopeful that y'all can help me understand something about creating conflicts and stakes and such.<br/><br/>This has been in the back of my mind for a while, but here are the two useful examples from Mortal Coil (great book, btw) that helped me clarify just what was bothering me:<br/><br/>(If anyone thinks this goes beyond Fair Use, please tell me and I'll edit.)
<blockquote><i>The scene is a bar, and Russell's character the Roman god Pluto, has just gotten the better of his rival Jupiter in a tense conflict.  Pluto and his friend have managed to get Jupiter so drunk he passes out at the back of the bar.  Conflict over, the players congratulate each other.  Michelle, the GM, now immediately sets a new scene to move the action along:  "OK.  The next day, Pluto is in his office, and the door slams open.  Stepping inside is none other than Jupiter, and he looks angry."</i><br/>--Brennan Taylor, Mortal Coil, p.12<br/></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Krista's character is trying to distract a rought-looking supporting character so that Jason's character can talk with the rough-looking fellow's girlfriend.  Before they begin to commit action tokens, Krista declares her intention: She wants to keep this person from noticing what Jason's character is doing.<br/><br/>The GM, realizing that the information the girlfriend possesses is important for moving the story forward, decides that failure will not block Jason from his action, but will instead allow the rough-looking character to realize what is going on, which will lead to complications after Jason's character finishes talking to his girlfriend.</i><br/>--Brennan Taylor, Mortal Coil, p.57<br/></blockquote>
Now, read separately, each example strikes me as being true and wonderful.  However, my problem is when I try to apply principle of the first example to the situation in the second example.  It seems to properly escalate the conflict in the second example, then the "rough-looking character" must in the next scene (or one soon after) futher complicate Jason's or Krista's life as a result of their <i>success</i>.  Otherwise, there is no longer any point in having that particular conflict in the first place.  Just like how succeeding against Jupiter -- or rather, <i>conflicting</i> with Jupiter -- necessitates a complication for Pluto.<br/><br/>So if I am on the right track so far, then isn't it all an illusion of choice anyway?  It seems you must give Jason the information to make the story move forward, <i>and</i> you must complicate their lives in some way related to the conflict.<br/><br/>Intuitively, I don't like that idea.  Not that it's the same as GM railroading exactly: there can still be player authority in deciding what the complication will be or what the information supplied will be.  But it still feels like stripping away meaningful choice on some level.  So I'm hoping one of you might either correct my reasoning or show me a loophole.  <br/><br/><br/>P.S.  This post is a good opportunity for an antisocial lurker like myself to thank you all for the content you create have here, both in terms of rpgs and discussions.  So thanks. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            What principle is it that you take from the first example?<br/>
<br/>
I mean ... yes, the GM does happen to jump right into a complication of the past conflict, but I'm not seeing where in the text you quoted it says that she <b>must</b> do that.  Am I missing something?                        </div>

                            My suggestion is to run screaming from any usage of the word "Stakes." It's been pretty messily used lately, and seems to lead to a lot of confusion.<br><br>Use the word GOALS. <br/><br/>So, these players are playing, and they want information from the girlfriend. That's their goal. Right? <br/><br/>Wrong.<br/><br/>The GM has no problem with that as a goal. They have no problem. No conflict. <br/><br/>So, what's the real goal? <br/><br/>The real goal is: "Get the information from the girlfriend <i>without hassle</i>."<br/><br/>Now we've got conflict! The GM has a different idea about how that should go down -- he thinks the boyfriend causing a little trouble is more interesting than just having the players get out the easy way. (He could just agree with "the easy way" in which case there's no conflict at all.)<br/><br/>So! Now there's a conflict! Dice/cards/chips/whatever hit the table, and they all use conflict resolution to decide what happens next. <br/><br/>Pretty cool.<br/><br/>The trouble in the example was that the goal was unclear to participants, and it appears to you the reader. And, worse, the GM decided, apparently without announcing or negotiation, what the conflict was. He just changed it in his head, and then said "If you lose, X happens." That's where the stakes usage comes into play, and it's a pretty dumb thing to do because it turns conflict resolution from something that lets people decide events AFTER dice hit the table to something that forces people to decide events BEFORE dice hit the table. In my view, that's bad.<br/><br/>By the way, this kind of example seems to happen all the time in games as players "just know" conflict, but I find it doesnt' hurt one bit, and often helps a lot, to take time to talk about the goal, announce it outloud and avoid any confusion.<br/><br/>Phew! Ok, now I haven't answered your question, really, about consequences. For now, I'll just say that the issue is determining whether it's an issue of consequences or just good ol' scene framing. (It also doesn't say anything one way or another about whether losing has any <i>mechanical</i> consequences, which most games include. There's almost always some crummy number thing that happens to your character when you lose, even if you want to charge right back into the enemy's office the next morning. Usually, you can, you're just worse off than you were before losing.)                        </br></br></div>

                            Hey Jarod, it feels weird to say it, but welcome to Story Games!<br/><br/>I like what Matt says a lot.  One thing I've found is that questions about what constitutes appropriate stake-setting, narration, and scene authority are determined by each group uniquely, regardless of what the rules of the game say or suggest.  Something to keep in mind, although I apologize for muddying the waters with social contract ambiguity.                        </div>

                            Jarod, I think I may have a different bead on the problem you're having.  I may be way off-target, too.<br/><br/>It seems to me you're asking, "In the Pluto/Jupiter example, the conflict happens and then there are repercussions to that conflict which generate more conflicts and more story; in the girlfriend example, the conflict resolution system may prevent a specific repercussion from occuring.  How is the procedure in the girlfriend example not potentially derailing the advice in the Pluto/Jupiter example?"<br/><br/>If that sounds right, great; if not, well, disregard everything that follows:<br/><br/>From what I understand of the game, <em>Mortal Coil</em> uses the 'bandolier of bangs' school of GMing and GM-prep.  That is, as GM you should have this fat stack of things to throw at your players and engender interesting reactions.  You should have so many, in fact, that you can toss the majority of them overboard and still keep banging away with the rest.  So if the boyfriend doesn't hassle the PCs, it's no big deal because there's always something <em>else</em> in your bandolier, quite possibly the information itself.  Or Jupiter can kick down their door in the following scene, for that matter.  Losing the one potential complication is no big deal, since you should be prepared with too many alternatives to use, anyway.<br/><br/>(And welcome to story-games!)                        </div>

                            Joshua, you have best summed up what I was trying to say.  Unfortunately, your answer just makes me more uncomfortable about the whole thing.  It seems to me that if losing a particular potential complication isn't a big deal, then why would one waste time on its originating conflict in the first place?  Simply to obstruct the players' "goal"?  To be fair, Mortal Coil specifically advises against that, and I'm sure anyone here would as well.  But if one relies on this "bandolier of bangs" method, isn't simple obstruction the essential result for a significant portion of the conflicts?                        </div>

                            Jarod, <br/><br/>Setting goals and stakes and all of that is a complicated thing when taken as a whole abstract, and the truth of it is that many groups have to find their own particular take on things to make them run smoothly. <br/><br/>For example, in my group the first example from Mortal Coil would probably not go over terribly well. It may seem a bit too much like causing shit because the players won, and that tends to get things thrown at me. However, it would depend a lot on what was riding on the situation and who had created Jupiter. If, for example, Jupiter was an NPC created by a player to be a particular foil to his PC, and/or the player had been saying something during the first conflict to the effect of "oh man, he's gonna be so pissed about this when he wakes up..." then not only would it be acceptable, it would be expected that the next day Jupiter would come a knockin. <br/><br/>For the second example, my group would probably be okay with that -- but I've played with others who would object to the GM deciding the information was needed to move the story forward part. I mean, "necessary for the plot" implies a degree of GM fiat about where the story is going, right? Now, if it was said "the girlfriend doesn't have an objection to telling you, so no conflict..." that'd be fine. (Probably, they might suggest reasons why she should object. Some people have to make it difficult.) With that out of the way they'd have no problem with the second part of the conflict -- avoiding a fight to get information is cool, and if you fail and have a fight, that's cool too. <br/><br/>It's also worth noting that my group, of late, has had a lot of "control plot flow" elements stacked into their goals when we play systems that allow it. I've seen lots of "get the information without getting in trouble" or "defeat Jupiter without him knowing I was behind it" or the like going around. Looking at it that way the second of the examples you give is the group doing a degree of that. In the first one they said "we want to win now, we don't care what happens tomorrow" in the second they said "we want to win now, and we don't want to have to fight the rough guy now or later." <br/><br/>Really, it all depends on what the subtext of the group and how they want to handle things goes, and how well the system supports it.                        </div>

                            Jarod, I know exactly where you're coming from!<br/><br/>One part of it -- if not the whole mess -- is understanding and embracing (at least for the space of the game) narrativist goals and setting aside more simmy/gamist goals that you may be used to.  It's something of a paradigm shift.<br/><br/>Roughly speaking, in games set up like this, you as a player are participating in conflicts (and instigating and escalating conflicts) in order to see what the results say about who your character is.  You are not (again, roughly) participating in conflicts in order to win or get your way.  Your character is totally doing stuff to get what he wants, but you as a player are doing things in order to see what makes the character squeal a new note.<br/><br/>So players accept that there will be complications <em>no matter what you do</em>, and indeed the players want that because the more complications there are, the more interesting knots they'll be able to contort their characters into.  This mode of play is very, very often of the complicated ball of conflicting agendas and desires sort of thing, most vividly exemplified in the "blood opera" (think: Hamlet, or better, Titus Andronicus).  Brand is fond of referring to it as "rocking with your cock out" and it can be rather masochistic in pursuit of a cathartic release at the end.<br/><br/>But just as Shakespeare does not make Hamlet do the "sensible" thing and kill his uncle in his sleep, but instead has him go through this giant baroque plot to put on a play that publically exposes him, you as a player in these games need to "go big" and leave the "sensible" solutions behind.  Those solutions are appropriate for other games.  In these games, you go for your own throat.<br/><br/>Am I making any sense?  It's kind of hard to express it outside of actual play.                        </div>

                            Tangential, pompous-sounding.  I want a do-over.<br/><del>Play example DO:<br/><br/><i>A bunch of players get-together one night and in gameplay make-up a story about an ancient greek citizen named Sisyphus, who gossiped about<br/>Zeus' sexual escapades; and was subsequently punished by being doomed to forever roll a rock up a hill in vain-- with the rock always escaping his<br/>grasp to roll to the bottom again.  Forever and ever, the end, amen.</i><br/><br/>Play example DON'T:<br/><br/><i>The players meet every subsequent Thursday night and actually role-play the part where Sisyphus rolls the rock and loses it and rolls it and loses it and<br/>rolls it and loses it and [escalation] the hill gets taller and [complication] the rock splits into more rocks that all have to be rolled, forever and ever without end.  The players convince themselves they're Doing It Right, because their design theory says so. </i><br/><br/><br/>The DO example delivers something which the dramatic form truly requires: a conclusion.   Also known as a 'resolution'.<br/><br/>The DON'T example lacks true resolution. A true ending.  So it is unsatisfying.  Instead, it tries to apply Dramatic Conventions<br/>(escalation, complications) to something other than Drama.  Escalation and Complications were  invented to serve a purpose:<br/>to make the ending more satisfying.  But without the ending-- what purpose do they serve?<br/><br/>Without an ending, drama becomes Something Else.  Such as: Rote melodrama. Soap opera.  Emo tail-chasing.<br/>The TV series that refuses to die because advertisers are still buying ad-time; although the dramatic ending came and went long ago.<br/>The dreaded Long Term Campaign.<br/><br/>The good news is that there are other forms-- aside from Drama-- which go on-and-on.  Such as Epic and Biography.  So you're all allowed to<br/>continue your beloved long games.  However, you ought to recognize that Narr theory which derives from the form of Drama is a mismatched<br/>tool for the job at hand.  And that IS where Narr theory came from.  Sources like Lajos Egri.<br/><br/>For example, according to David Mamet, repetition without resolution is a hallmark of the biography form.  Which makes sense.  It is satisfying to 'explain' a person's life by showing that they -always- embody something recognizable which defines them.   But, as Jarod has begun to show us, repetition doesn't mix well with 'resolution'.  Resolution implies progress.   <br/><br/>I don't know whether I've nailed it, or digressed into a tangent.  But I'm going to post this as-is anyway.<br/>There are other approaches I could have chosen, which I think lead to similar conclusions.<br/><br/>----<br/>Edit:<br/><br/>In the examples Jarod gave; stakes were set which would resolve (end) a scene.  If the scene can be followed by a subsequent story-- a subsequent scene-- which builds-on the former scene: great. But if the subsequent scene negates the previous scene by rendering it redundant--well-- that's an unsatisfying bummer.<br/><br/>Likewise, if the resolution of the previous scene renders the result of the subsequent scene a foregone conclusion, then playing-out the sequel will be tedious.<br/></del> </div>

                            K.T.<br/><br/>There are some problems with our hippy ways. However, in neither of the above examples does the subsequent scene necessarily negate the previous scene, nor make the sequel forgone. <br/><br/>Jupiter, for example, may have lost something important the night before. Jupiter being angry about being beaten doesn't negate whatever else the players won for beating him. <br/><br/>However, I do see examples of this in some AP reports (mostly from new hippies, or hippies whose groups put up with more shit than mine would) were subsequent conflicts start to have a very real "GM telling you what you did wrong" vibe. That, however, is a bigger subject than what we're looking at here. If you want to pursue it, maybe we should spin off to a new thread?                        </div>

                            Hey Curly, note that I didn't at any point say, "...and this is the best way evar to play teh roleplaying gamez."  I've been very let down by this exact situation myself, and the answer I've come to is "the game is not designed to support my expectations here."  That the game doesn't support my expectation is not a fault of the game any more than a piece of cake not being able to hammer in a nail makes it a bad piece of cake.  Games are crafted to do things, and we get absolutely nowhere if we play them all expecting the same exact things.  <em>Mortal Coil</em> is not designed for strategic, tactical, my-pawn-wins-the-day against overwhelming odds thing.  If you're playing that game expecting that play, you're hammering nails with a piece of cake.                        </div>

                            JBR,<br/><br/>I know you are a champion of measuring each game by what it does well, not all games by some One True standard.<br/><br/>Also, I am completely ignorant about Mortal Coil, so my comments are not specific to that game.<br/><br/>Thus, by your each-game-is-unique approach; I have nothing to contribute to this discussion.<br/>However, I think I do have a useful point.  <br/><br/>Yet, I can't make that point without it sounding like -I- am fixated on my very-own One True Best Way Evar Teh Gamez.<br/><br/>So take what I say with those grains of salt.  OK?<br/><br/>What I say is this: we share a vocabulary which has helped us conceive of all sorts of games.  Strict definitions of the vocab terms<br/>are useful insofar as they help us all stay on the same page, not talk past each other.  But nebulous definitions are useful when<br/>discrepencies in our understanding lead to a true diversity of thought and, thus, diversity of good games.<br/><br/>In the case of this discussion, I see Jarod bumping-into several problems which are real.   One problem is the result of Task<br/>and Conflict being conflated; either in a players' head/ or in the actual resolution system of a given game.<br/><br/>I tend to favor a One True Way bias toward treating Task and Conflict as Orthogonal.  I don't see Task as a variety of Conflict.<br/>There are advantages to conflating them, such as the simplicity of a game design which has one central mechanic to resolve both as if they were interchangable.  But the cost of such a mechanic is that it over and over we've seen such designs lead to questions like Jarod's.<br/><br/>And the often-seen 'solution' of giving Jarod (or whoever) a lecture about how his his Narr-fu is not strong enough-- doesn't cut it.<br/>As you note, JBR, If the game doesn't support avoiding Stakes resolution snafus, then the player isn't at fault for finding the bugs.                        </div>

                            What Jarrod is asking about lacks context completely. There's nothing wrong with that. It's a pretty natural question given the information he appears to have at this point. <br/><br/>But, like I said, it just lacks context and actual play. We have no idea what transpires between getting drunk and storming into an office. It <i>appears</i> with this limited info that it just follows bang, bang. <br/><br/>But, it doesn't make much sense. It's not that there's <i>bad</i> process going on here (bad GMing or whatever). It's that there's <i>no information at all</i>. We just don't know.<br/><br/>And, when I see this question, I just shrug. I think "Huh, yeah, with that info it sure seems like it'd be no fun and problematic and inconsequential play that no one would like."<br/><br/>But, what I'm not seeing is Jarrod saying "So my group actually tried this and it sucked and here's why." <br/><br/>Actualy play! Actual play! Actual play! <br/><br/>Talking about stuff that seems like it would be no fun because it reads like it would be no fun ignores all kinds of stuff that's going on in actual play that is loads of fun! <br/><br/>I can think of a dozen ways that the drunk/office scenario would be a blast, make sense, have consequences and so on. I can think of a dozen more that would suck donkey balls, make no sense, and be aggravating play. <br/><br/>But, as presented, I can think of those dozens of ways because I'm filling in the blanks in my head. <br/><br/>This isn't a critique of hippy-dippy play. It's a critique of not enough information about play. It's coming from an example in a game text to explain rules. Hell, even THAT isn't actual play. Now, I think game designers need to be aware how problematic their examples can be, especially because people use them in ways unintended. Brennan's using this example to explain one aspect of his rules set, I think. He's not using it to describe sum-and-total what playing Mortal Coil-style gaming is like. It'd be a 12 page entry at least in that case!<br/><br/>Examples in game text are a real pain in the ass to write. You can either give an example with context, in which case you generally lose the impact of explaining a specific rule or process, or you can write the specific rule/process and generally lose the context entirely. Its' very difficult to do. <br/><br/>Jarrod, you're asking great questions. Maybe you can use some examples from your group's sessions that would help explain it? Or, seek more input from others, like Judd, who have done something like this stuff? <br/><br/>Because, I know how frustrating it is to hear "Eh, it isn't really a problem when you get to playing." But, you know, it isn't problem in my experience!                        </div>

                            Hey Jarod, after reading your first example (and dancing through the thread), I just wanted to share something that I've been doing with my traddy games. <br/><br/>Here's an example from a Tenra Bansho session I ran a few weeks back. The system is simple, you roll dice and get successes, just like World of Darkness.<br/><br/>So there were two characters in an open roadside tavern just sitting, drinking, and listening/looking to get a feel for the town. However, they're trying to be really inconspicuous (because they have a valuable artifact that lots of people are looking for).  One of the players said, "I want to use my Information skill to listen in on conversations, find out what's going on in town. See if anyone is looking for us."<br/><br/>Difficulty for tasks ranges from 1 success for "easy" to up to 6 successes for "legendary/impossible".<br/><br/>I said, "OK, one success and you'll get an answer to your question. But there's a lot of other people looking for info here, too.  If you get three successes, you'll not only get your answer, but you won't subtly attract attention to yourself."<br/><br/>Most of the time, I do the above in my head as GM ("OK, one success or even NO successes and they succeed, but unless they get X successes there will be complications"), but these days I try to throw it to the players so they know what they're looking for.<br/><br/>Other example, similar to the Mortal Coil example above:<br/><br/>"OK, roll your Knowledge and Melee Weapons. You're going to know how this guy died either way; you need that information to continue: However, the more successes you gain, the more Additional information you'll get from examining the body, which may help you later" (and in the GM's head I set additional clues at 2, 4 and 6 successes).<br/><br/>Or, with numbers:<br/><br/>"You're trying to leap from this castle wall onto the running horse below, huh? OK, to succeed, to make that jump, you're going to need... 2 successes.  Otherwise you'll take damage.  If you get 5 or more successes, you made a fantastic feat and can take another action or speed the horse up. But if you get between 2 and 4, you hit the horse and are barely managing to stay on; you'll get no more actions as you try to steady yourself."<br/><br/>Or with a goal the players REALLY want to meet, with a lesser goal slid in there to show "success at the task".<br/><br/>"You say you want to question this guy and do so in a way where you're manipulating him so that he doesn't know you're prying, and that he gives up the information without thinking about it? That's a tough one. OK, 5 successes.  But if you happen to get 2 or more successes, you'll get that information, but he'll be on to you.  Go for it, and aim for 5!"<br/><br/>So yeah, this kind of thing can be applied to the old 'task resolution' system as well, just be clear about what your goal is, and come up with a range of successes on the fly.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            JBR:  Whichever I'm actually offering.  Sometimes not all four slots have something in them ... like, if I want the guy to get across the bridge that the goblins are firing arrows at, I might say "Okay, you're automatically getting across the bridge (#1) and if you get three successes you don't end up with arrows sticking out of you (#3)."                        </div>

Very well, thank you.  I think I'll use Tony's method to test the waters and then work from there.                        </div>

                            Here's another tidbit, which may or may not apply to Mortal Coil (I haven't read it recently).<br><br>Instead of the GM "just saying" that complications happen, or having to explicitly lay them all out ahead of time, you can use the system currency after the conflict.<br><br/>Let's say you're playing Sorcerer. You "get Jupiter Drunk." You and Jupiter roll against each other and someone wins. If you win, maybe you have three successes. The next day, he storms into your office and is pissed, but you have three bonus dice against him now, because of how you whomped him before. So yeah, it's a plot complication, but the cool thing you did earlier helps you out now. And the GM doesn't just mandate the complication outcome "for free."<br/><br/>Or maybe, Jupiter kicks your butt in the "drunk" conflict. But yeah, he gets drunk. And then he gets pissed. And now HE has bonus dice to use against you in his rage, because he whomped you before. The system is engaged to measure how much oomph the fallout gets, which keeps everything on the same playing field. The GM is free to "screw the PCs" all she wants because any complicating thing she comes up with still has to touch the system and generate some currency to have bite.                        </br></br></br></div>
