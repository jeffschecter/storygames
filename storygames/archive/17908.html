I'm keen in playing this sort of style again after years and years away from it.  One thing I'm especially interested in doing as a part of this is designing my own dungeons.  But it has been SO LONG since I've played this style of RPG, I don't even remember how.  <br/><br/>So, could I get some helpful suggestions?  What is the process some of you use to create a fun, engaging dungeon or lair?  Do I start with the boss and work my way up, or start with the different factions that live in the dungeon, or what?  Any help, especially something layed out like a process, would be most appreciated. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405232/#Comment_405232" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T13:31:26+00:00" title="February  1, 2013  1:31PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on what you want, what system you are using, what your ideal level of prep is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405233/#Comment_405233" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T13:33:37+00:00" title="February  1, 2013  1:33PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony Dowler's <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/Dungeon.aspx" rel="nofollow">How to Host a Dungeon</a>?

As you might know, my conception of D&amp;D is fanatically one-sided: the game is a means for us, as a group, to arrive at intellectually stimulating, emotionally appealing fictional challenges. How does my hero survive this challenge? Is there any way? Could this challenge be any more awesome? These questions need to come up in play.<br/><br/>Consequently I have two basic ways I design an adventure (location-based or not, doesn't matter at this point yet): either I've got an emotionally appealing idea, or an intellectually challenging one. Ideally I'd have an idea that combines both, or where one immediately implies the other.<br/><br/>As an example of what I mean, last year I wrote an adventure I call "The Prometheus Initiative". I got the core idea from my friend Sami, who was considering creating a D&amp;D adventure, but didn't quite have the motivation. The idea was that the player characters could be cave-men, early homo sapiens, trying to steal the secret of fire from the neanderthals.<br/><br/>Now, the above is a fine idea for a D&amp;D adventure in my books: it's emotionally appealing, and it's intellectually stimulating as well. We know what challenges are present in confronting the neanderthal threat: they're bigger and stronger than you are, and perhaps they've got racial memory or partial telepathy, or at least they talk with each other by sign language because their vocal chords are not so good. (This is a fantasy game, remember, so I'm just revisiting genre fluff here.) Maybe they've got sabretooth tigers, too. And how do you "steal the secret of fire", anyway? Is it a spying mission, or do you need to capture some neanderthals to show you, or is it somehow more mystical?<br/><br/>Once I've got the core idea, I follow it in the fiction, while maintaining a fruitful, ambiguous tension with the mechanical system. By this I mean that I look for opportunities to mechanize various fictional ideas that occur to me, but without following a mechanical program per se. The goal is for the game to make tactical and strategic claims, but to not really have an overpowering means of enforcing those claims against the players.<br/><br/>In the neanderthal adventure one such mechanical claim would be that the neanderthal cavemen are mightier than the poor humans. I give them 2 HD to represent this; it's not quite enough to make them inhumanly impossible for an ordinary 1st level hero to overcome, but in setting terms it's pretty clear that they're the boss of me and you on the savannah. Also, reading old D&amp;D game texts, we learn that in the earliest monster manuals neanderthal tribes have boss neanderthals that have double HD and that are nearly gigantic in size. Sounds good to me, let's throw that in. Also check the stats for sabertooth tigers and such while we're at it.<br/><br/>While doing all this I also develop the strategic environment of the scenario: why and what the PCs are doing, what resources might there be available, and so on. What makes sense in the fiction is the key here: it would be an empty victory if I managed to "balance" the scenario by making it non-credible in nature. On the other hand, anything that makes sense can and should probably be thrown in, on the principle that you won't know in advance what'll be important and what not. Following this logic I determined that the neanderthals live in one of those big cliff-side cave complexes that we see in caveman simulations now and then; they've stolen it from the human tribe that needs the fire some years back, forcing the humans into hiding in the forest. The neanderthals are no runners, but they've got jackal dogs that are, perhaps, and approaching the cliff unseen is difficult because of the steppe/savannah surrounding it. The human tribe knows of a secret underground cave-way into the cliff, as they used to live there before. Furthermore, snakemen!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405264/#Comment_405264" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T17:54:31+00:00" title="February  1, 2013  5:54PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Snakemen? Yes, that came about because the strategic context needs to be accessible from the viewpoint of the campaign. My D&amp;D campaign is set in a fantastic version of 17th century Europe, so the strategic layer needs to have some sort of context for the adventure. I chose to rip a page from the Assassin's Creed playbook: a crazy, probably deluded cult contacts the party for help, they need somebody to travel back in time and stop a snakeman priest that has rearranged prehistory so that humanity never discovers fire. I told the party wizard (after some knowledge checks) that there is only a 1/6 chance that the cult is right - more likely they're just crazy. Either way, the cult insists that only people who had direct ancestors in a certain tribe of humans 10 000 years ago can use the cult's magic to travel back to that time, inhabiting the bodies of their ancestors. (Player characters miraculously very commongly have this background.) It is very important that the party succeeds in stealing fire back from the neanderthals, as the ritual costs 10 000 gp per shot, and nobody knows when the history will snap into a new configuration.<br/><br/>Pay attention to what I do here: this is not just mindless fluff as you might see in a game that is predicated on GM soliloquy. There are all sorts of strategic concerns embedded here. For instance, the party might simply not believe that the threat is real; I know I wouldn't, were I playing. (My backup plan, which I told the party wizard: if my crazy threat actually happens because the players refuse my adventure hook, or because they fail, I'll just drop in <i>Carcosa</i>: the campaign setting as we know it dissolves into the mists of time, and up comes Carcosa, world as the snakemen intended it.) They could also fund multiple attempts at the adventure, should they have the money for it. And whatever happens, I've introduced the multiplanar, chronotastic threat of the snakepeople into the campaign over the long-term.<br/><br/>A complex strategic context is the hall-mark of a good D&amp;D adventure to my mind: the adventure hooks need to be interesting, and the adventures need to have impact on the setting, whether the players go for them in the sandbox context or not. This adventure of mine is pretty frivolous in how it gambles with the fate of the entire setting, but at least it drives this point home. Although passive hole-in-the-ground adventures that do not have anything interesting and dynamic going on with them have their place in the game (they provide the backdrop baseline of activity), it never hurts to give dynamic hooks as well. Players can always wait for the dynamic situation to pass, and return to the adventure site when all the time-critical events have passed.<br/><br/>Anyway, onwards: once I have an idea, challenges and strategic context, I draw some maps and develop whatever details are needed to run the adventure. This is the most trivial part in many ways, I recommend learning it by running premade adventure modules, like I've been doing. Of course individual tactical situations can be clever, but ultimately the best way to ensure their cleverness is to not preplan too much: don't think about how many neanderthal guards with their jackal dogs the adventuring party should face, but rather think of how many guards such a tribe should sensibly have. Let the bones fall as they may. This is the stage at which I decided that the neanderthals would have a fire constantly burning, tantalizing, in the highest cave on the cliff. There would also be a snakeman sorcerer in the cave, the very same one that had taken the Time Road to distant past in an attempt to extinguish humanity in the craddle. (I like the mechanical nature of the snakemen I developed for this: they use multiples of d6-1 for their hitpoints, as they're an old and wizened people, weak and frail from the ravages of time. The snakeman in the adventure is 5 HD, so very fearsome for 1st level adventurers, but it could potentially be pretty frail in the HP department depending on the rolls.)<br/><br/>A consequence scheme is also needed for the adventure. Traditionally this is often disappointingly one-dimensional in that the party either gets lots of treasure (and xp), or they die. Mix this up a bit! For my stone age adventure I provided an alternate xp scheme where the party gained 1000 xp for successfully stealing fire from the neanderthals, who were obviously extremely poor in material terms - players could loot the neanderthals, but the looted furs and tools and such took a lot of carrying, so likely they couldn't make off with too much unless they actually organized an army to crush the entire neanderthal tribe all at once. There was also a semi-secret, implied extra xp source in that the 1000 xp for bringing fire was per human tribe: PCs could potentially stick around after the adventure and get into the civilization-building business by traveling around the prehistorical world and spreading the knowledge about fire far and wide, thus ensuring that the snake-men wouldn't get a chance to extinguish the knowledge again. Some spin-off campaign potential there.<br/><br/>That's pretty much all, I think! It's probably disappointing that I don't have more to say about the tactical details part of scenario development, but in my own head that's almost the last thing I worry about. It's much more important to have a compelling idea for a challenge that is both intellectually interesting (how do primitive cavemen infiltrate another tribe's cliff cave complex to steal the secret of fire?) and poetic (which I think I've got in spades, what with the inhuman neanderthal pretenders attempting to shift history, the devious snakeman priest, a much-feared sabretooth tiger in the random encounter table, annoying jackal dogs sniping at the heels, some inter-tribal slavery if PCs get captured, underground cave spelunking and whatnot). After that it's just a matter of arranging everything into a challenge environment that is feasible to referee and provides for loose, unexpected problem-solving possibilities.<br/><br/>(I probably should post the end-result of this process, too. Maybe I'll find it from somewhere, although I seem to remember that the actual text is only 80% done. I was writing it for the One-Page Dungeon contest, but the scenario became too cool to be forced into the confines of a single page.)<br/><br/>If I may philosophize about it, I'd almost say that it's better if the tactical level of your adventure design is somewhat haphazard and doesn't follow mechanical patterns too tightly. It'll make for a more lively and organic overall experience, and it'll prevent you from preplanning things you should not: once you fall into the trap of planning the experience instead of planning the playing pieces, you've already lost, philosophically speaking. You should never catch yourself fine-tuning a single room of your dungeon, thinking about how the players will react and what they will think about facing that room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405269/#Comment_405269" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-01T19:39:22+00:00" title="February  1, 2013  7:39PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done this twice and had good results:<br/><br/>1.

The dungeon design portion of the game was inspired in part by the things I really enjoyed after playing OSR-style D&amp;D with Tavis Allison.<br/><br/>I made a list of various features to inspire dungeon design. Simple concepts like "think in three dimension, even though you're looking at a piece of paper", and "don't create a linear dungeon" (generally speaking, there should be meaningful choices at any given point for adventurers exploring the dungeon). But also some neat stuff (at least in my thinking) like "figure out how many exits/entrances there are to the dungeon" (generally more than one is good). Think about how these exits matter to the denizens of the dungeon. Is there an entrance from which monsters emerge at night to drink water? Or one which is hidden below the nearby village, which means that one monster is killed, another monster which is now unable to find anything to eat (it used to prey on the first monster), and will probably start moving into the village and killing people there?<br/><br/>Stuff like that. I'll see if I can dig something up, but I don't know if I will have time to post it.

I remember always letting the players do what they like and react with the NPCs according to their own motivations.

Multiple paths/non-linearity<br/> <br/>The ideal dungeon gives the players a number of ways to get from one place to another, so that they can choose what direction to explore, or in what order to encounter various challenges. Create a number of closed loops, interchanges, and crossroads, so that there are many different ways to get from one part of the dungeon to another. Avoid a series of rooms that can only be traversed in a fixed sequence (although these can, of course, appear from time to time, it's more interesting if they are intentionally created by someone blocking off entrances and collapsing exit tunnels). The adventurers should almost always have a variety of options to explore (and the potential to get lost!).<br/> <br/>2. Don't forget the third dimension<br/> <br/>Make your dungeon 3-D: include collapsed areas, pits, tall ceilings, openings to the surface, underground towers, waterfalls, etc. Just because your paper is a flat surface doesn't mean the dungeon should be.<br/> <br/>3. Engage the senses<br/> <br/>Each area of the dungeon should have its own signature features. Remember to bring in all five senses rather than just describing dimensions: remember that the adventurers are moving around in the dark, with limited light (and occasionally no light at all). Consider which areas are pitch dark and which are partially lit, and then consider smells, sounds, textures, and even taste. One part of the dungeon might be musty, the air thick, hard to breathe... another might smell like decaying flesh, yet a third might feature oddly smooth walls and seem to suck up sounds (in contrast to an earlier chamber that echoes one's voice back at a shocking volume). These sensory impressions should take priority over simple description like the shape and size of rooms (which are hard to judge without careful measurements, anyway), and could potentially become an adventurer's only guide if he or she is moving around in the dark.<br/> <br/>4. Consider how areas "bleed over" into each other, and what details are apparent to an explorer<br/> <br/>At important intersections, or places where one area connects to another, give some thought to what tell-tale marks, smells, sounds, or visuals might be apparent to an explorer. When an adventurer stands at the edge of the Great Hall and looks into the next chamber below, what might they notice?<br/> <br/>Deciding whether to go "left or right" should never feel like an arbitrary choice. Give the players some details before they make their decision. Base these details on the shape and nature of the area ahead (a large area carries echoes, the sound of dripping water, the smell of decaying flesh, a cold breeze which threatens to blow out torches) or on the nature of the monsters inhabiting a certain area (the adventurers can hear scraping noises, an area seems eerily quiet or still, or perhaps they can see the skeleton of a huge beast lying in the corridor, picked clean by some scavengers).</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405391/#Comment_405391" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T12:00:18+00:00" title="February  4, 2013 12:00PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Exploring and Mapping the Dungeon</b><br/> <br/>When adventurers explore a dungeon, they could easily get lost if they don't keep their bearings. The GM should describe the areas they encounter in visceral, sensual detail, including smells, sounds, and other things the characters' senses might pick up. However, it is not the GM's job to tell the players where they are, where they should go next, or how to find their way out of the dungeon. It is also not the GM's job to give the players precise measurements or distances: her job is to bring the dungeon to life, not to help the players dissect it.<br/> <br/>For this reason, most smart adventurers will attempt to "map" the dungeon as they go through it. If they wish to explore an area in detail and measure it to the best of their capacity (based on their Features and equipment), they may choose to take extra time to do so. The GM should give as much information and as much detail as seems reasonable, based on what they are doing (for example, if the characters want to take the time to pace off a room, the GM should give her best estimate of how many paces across the room might be). Exploring and measuring a room or area in detail takes some time (and the GM should roll for monster actions - see below).</blockquote>\nIs this helpful or not so helpful?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405407/#Comment_405407" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-04T15:33:44+00:00" title="February  4, 2013  3:33PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero: Great stuff!

I mean, I've been rocking D&amp;D lately, as they say, but I'd like to think that I don't need to find some obscure altar to Gygax and swear undying loyalty to TSR product history to be allowed to like the game. Consequently I'm pretty critical of D&amp;D game texts as they've been actually been preserved for us; much of what makes the game great is never said in there, and much that is said has unnecessarily hampered play - I'm thinking of the game mechanical issues especially, D&amp;D has always been <i>super</i> conservative (until they decided to abandon the old game and remake it entirely, that is) and pretty clumsy, which has been a detriment to the game. I mean, it could be more beautiful mechanically without losing anything.<br/><br/>I don't think that I've ever read an official D&amp;D game text that would have explained sandbox campaigning in a way that I'd be entirely happy with. In fact, I haven't seen any commercial text, official or not, that'd really explain it. (It's possible that AD&amp;D 1st edition GM's guide does this. Funny as it is, I've yet to read that one. My excuse is that there are a lot of these texts.) There are several D&amp;D texts that explain how to run a dungeon in a very, very detailed manner, but that's as far as it goes. The dungeon D&amp;D is a nice game for one-shots, of course, but I think that it'd be better if campaigns were played in sandbox format to begin with. It's not natural for the game to have successful adventurers come out of the dungeon as rich men, and then not explore the consequences strategically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405459/#Comment_405459" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T07:20:08+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  7:20AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How very true.

It's an excellent article. <br/><br/>Plus, it has me reading through Jaquays' Caverns of Thracia now, which is a pretty amazing dungeon to read. It's super complicated to map and to explore - the number of different directions you can approach things from is pretty amazing.

It really gives a sense of how a cave complex can be explored, caved in, rediscovered, vandalized, settled, etc. over time. And not even all that much time. All that stuff in the story happened over only about 70 years.<br/><br/>Think about how much barely recorded stuff happened to that cave in a 70 year span of contemporary life with high literacy, government involvement, etc.<br/><br/>It makes it interesting to think how you don't need the 1100 year time span that Jacquays used for Caverns of Thracia in order for things to be old and forgotten. Especially in a time with minimal literacy and reduced travel. One local disaster can wipe out local history and reduce it to scattered rumors and legends pretty quickly. <br/><br/>Also, I loved the part in the Robber Barron Cave story where someone found an underground cave with a pipe going to it and later figured out whose well it was. That gives great ideas for how cave systems and dungeons can relate to nearby settlements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406499/#Comment_406499" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T06:08:14+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  6:08AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found a few more links that people might enjoy:<br/><br/><a href="http://davidvs.net/name/design.shtml#Maps" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://davidvs.net/name/design.shtml#Maps</a><br/><a href="http://www.dungeonmastering.com/tools-resources/dungeon-design-101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dungeonmastering.com/tools-resources/dungeon-design-101</a><br/><a href="http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2009/02/old-school-dungeon-design-guidelines.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2009/02/old-school-dungeon-design-guidelines.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Dungeon-in-D%26D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Dungeon-in-D&amp;D</a><br/><a href="http://www.arena.net/blog/william-fairfield-on-designing-the-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.arena.net/blog/william-fairfield-on-designing-the-dungeons</a><br/><br/>Hope these are helpful <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
