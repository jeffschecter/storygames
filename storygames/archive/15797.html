When things get tense, I feel like it's my job as GM to follow the fiction and decide who should go next, fictionally.  If people are in different locations, often I follow the action like a movie, letting one group make a few moves or do non-move things, before swinging back to the other group. If everyone's all together, I do the "take turns but not like <i>taking turns</i>" thing. That gets harder in larger groups, but ideally I would avoid playing AW/DW with more than 3-4 players anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358683/#Comment_358683" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T10:44:31+00:00" title="February 10, 2012 10:44AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, what Hans says is true.

So you can't declare an action and then have it not happen, unless the player decides not to actually do it.<br/><br/>So, in your first example, the Savvyhead makes their seduce move first. Then I might turn to the Angel and say: "Do you want to interfere? Like rip the mutant from the Saavyhead's arms and kick them into a ravine?"  And they might attempt to interfere, stopping the seduction. But then the Saavyhead could also interfere in the Angel's attempt to kick them into a ravine. Everything can happen, it's not "One player gets to make a make a move and the other player can't do anything about it, and loses their turn."<br/><br/>P.S. Hans is also right that fictional positioning like "who's standing where" can also matter, if that's already been established. But sometimes it hasn't and it feels a bit fake to invent it on the fly.  I was assuming the latter, since it wasn't spelled out in the example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358709/#Comment_358709" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T11:31:41+00:00" title="February 10, 2012 11:31AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2012 11:36AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>Scenario:* The Savvyhead wants to seduce the mutant and embrace it in a loving kiss.<br/>* The Angel wants to kick it into a lava ravine.</blockquote>\nWell that one seems simple, assuming they both express their desires at about the same time. It takes a lot less time to kick someone into a ravine than seduce them -- so the Savvyhead may walk up and be all 'HellO SEXy' but before anything gets steamy the Angel is going to have plenty of time to walk up there and kick the dude into the ravine. Whether the Angel decides to still do this once the Savvyhead has started a conversation, who knows -- ask them.<br/><br/>(And if anything the Savvyhead is aiding the Angel, by distracting the mutant -- though that has a lot to do with how the characters react to what each other are doing.)<br/><br/>Of course if it's like a situation where the Angel and Savvyhead are standing there arguing about what to do, then I'd say the 'kicking the mutant' action has a sort of natural fictional precedence, assuming they both decide to try their plan at the same time. Again, it's just a much more immediate action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358730/#Comment_358730" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T13:19:51+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  1:19PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2012 1:27PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone gets more specific about what's happening until the order of actions is obvious.

Making custom moves is fun and good for the game.<br/><br/><b><i>When the chaos of battle is about to envelop you</i></b>, roll+cool. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. Spend your hold 1-for-1 on the following as the battle plays out:<br/>- Get your bearings and develop a clear, accurate picture of just exactly what the fuck is going on<br/>- Interrupt someone else's action with your own<br/>- Coordinate with someone else to time something just right<br/><br/>I dunno. Something better than that, but there's a quick stab at it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358735/#Comment_358735" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T13:38:59+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  1:38PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2012 1:42PM by mease19.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When <b>a split second makes all the difference</b>, both of you roll+DEX.

As the GM, ask questions until it's clearer whose actions are actually triggering who else's actions or until further information emerges that yields, for example, greater clarity.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>Part of "to do it, do it" is about declaring actions. So you can't declare an action and then have it not happen, unless the player decides not to actually do it.</blockquote>\nI'm confused by this a bit. People speak and wonder and suppose and rescind and retcon their declared actions all the time to assemble the fiction, right? Can you explain how "to do it, do it" covers initiative order?
