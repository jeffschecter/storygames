Well, I am not well versed in the wide-variety of story games that are out there or even RPG theory, although from what I can gather, most of it is focused on "The Forge."<br/>\n<br/>\nI am coming to a close with the first stage of my RPG and am getting ready to think about making it look professional and all that entails.  One of the things I wanted to do was take the RPG philosophy that has evolved along with the system and write it down in a concise and systematic treatment.  Of course I'll have to compare it to the other philosophies, Big Model, GNS etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeres the question:<br/>\nWhat theories /articles /games do I need to research in order that my own article/theory can be placed within the greater context of the community of theories.<br/>\nIf I stick to strickly Forge article, is that sufficient?<br/>\nWhat Games are absolutely necessary to play/understand in order to grasp the genre.<br/>\n<br/>\nMan, this is such a noob post.  oh well.

Which isn't correct.  There's a reason that Ron shut down the GNS and Theory forums at The Forge.  It wasn't to say "theory is done" or "the theory here is complete."  It was done to drive theory discussion into the Actual Play forum.<br/><br/>That's because that's how the theories were developed in the first place.  Everyone took a good hard look at what they were actually, really doing, at the table and threw away all the dishonest bullshit that goes on in games.  From that they extracted principles and then built games that were honed to what they, personally, wanted out of play without regard for what an RPG "is" or what other people might "want."<br/><br/>So, is YOUR game built to be what YOU want out of  a game? Really and truly?  Then irregardless of where it "fits" with Forge theory it's already built in the spirit The Forge was intended to be about all along.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197242/#Comment_197242" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T14:35:01+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  2:35PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2009 2:39PM by ccreitz.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            outsider, you have articulated the difference between modern and postmodern games quite nicely.  As soon as designers decided to write toward a theory (or theories), rather than theorizing about what they'd written, they crossed the line (I think of it as the "Dostoevsky Line").  The Forge was where RPG design postmodernism really gelled, rather than being unevenly and even na\xefvely scattered among games hither and yon, and if you're looking for games to read and play that will help you understand that transition, you could do a lot worse than Forge impresario Ron Edwards' own work (<i>Trollbabe</i>, <i>Sorcerer</i>).  I found it especially illuminating to consider the differences between the (fine) pretheoretical game <i>Mage: The Ascension</i> and the early postmodern <i>Sorcerer</i>, but of course your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>You don't need to cross that theory line with the Forge-inspired designers, of course.  "Pretheoretical" doesn't mean "bad".  But maybe you, like a lot of people who come into contact with it, will find that your successful games had things in common, that your unsuccessful games had other things in common, and that the Forge-theory helpfully characterizes some of the differences.<br/><br/>I recommend, if you're launching into Forgery, that you start with the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/27/" rel="nofollow">provisional glossary</a>.  It will make a little sense when you read it the first time, and more sense (though I've never gotten it to make <i>complete</i> sense) when you've read more of the articles and discussions.  You should know that in the Forge's discussions, a few games are considered touchstones, are always used in examples, and are never listed by their full titles: TSoY is <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, BW is <i>Burning Wheel</i>, PTA <i>Primetime Adventures</i>... it goes on and on and on.  I spent months reading mentioned rulebooks in my Copious Free Time to feel like I had a chance of understanding the state of the art.  (The highlights among Forgey games, in case you care about my opinion for some reason, would be <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, <i>My Life with Master</i>, <i>InSpectres</i>, <i>The Shab al-Hiri Roach</i> and its silly little brother <i>Drowning and Falling</i>, BW's offspring <i>Mouse Guard</i>, <i>Sorcerer</i>, and PTA.)  Worse: these new works are best understood in light of some earlier games that also come up a lot in conversation: <i>Ars Magica</i>, <i>Puppetland</i>, the unloved but influential <i>Everway</i>, D&amp;D in both the Red Box and 3.x incarnations, <i>The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen</i>... it just never ends.

The essay "System Does Matter," in particular, contains a few things that are outmoded or misguiding, as does "GNS and Other Matters of Roleplaying."<br/><br/>This is because these articles are not and never were a presentation of This Is the Thing. They were (and are) part of an ongoing conversation that has led to these things getting hammered out. (So, why are they still there? Because the <i>whole conversation</i> is still there, and still continues).<br/><br/>All of which is to say, yes, start with the articles. But please don't stop there and think that you've got it all.<br/><br/>Another thing: there's several folks who have gone off and written stuff on their blogs that explains and re-explains some of this stuff. <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/what-gns-theory-claims" rel="nofollow">This right here</a> is a really good one for explaining the Creative Agenda thing.

Games designed precisely as games and not "to" theory will nonetheless reflect theory (or rejection of it) because the knowledge is sufficiently pervasive. I think D&amp;D 4e might fall tidily into this category--even if the theory knowledge is second or third hand, the design clearly reflects exposure to it. I expect plenty of games now do and most written from here forward will do so with increasing disinterest in the details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197389/#Comment_197389" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T09:52:43+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  9:52AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2009 9:55AM by timfire.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, ccreitz have fallen into the very misconception that Jesse was trying to warn the OP about. I can't think of a single,<i> successful</i> RPG that was written "towards a theory".(*) It used to be common advice over at the Forge that if you tried, you would fail ('cause many did try to design towards theory, and the games always ended up not good). The Big Model was always a<b> de</b>scriptive theory, never a<b> pre</b>scripive theory, much to the confusion of many a new designer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for the record, ccreitz cites <i>Sorcerer</i> as a prime example of a game that was designed towards a theory, but <i>Sorcerer</i> was originally conceived in the late '90s, way before the Forge or any of the articles (and thus the theory) came into existence. It's just as "pretheorectical" as<i> Mage</i>.<br/>\n__________<br/>\n<br/>\n(*) Actually,<i> Universalis</i> might have been written with an eye towards<i> economic theory</i>, but certainly not RPG theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197401/#Comment_197401" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T10:29:13+00:00" title="March 17, 2009 10:29AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2009 10:30AM by Josh Roby.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Enh.

I stand corrected.  Its postmodernism must fall into the same category, then, as that of <i>Everway</i>, still incoherent, but understanding that even the most basic assumptions (na\xefve "realism") of existing games were arbitrary and disposable.  Still, don't you think it's interesting the Edwards chose to lead us to think that "System matters"-type concerns drove the publication, at least, of his game?<br><br>At any rate, I disagree strongly with your contention that taking theory as a design inspiration \u2014 that is, taking it in some sense as prescriptive \u2014 hasn't led to good game design.  The thank-yous of too many excellent games weigh in on the other side of that argument, for starters.  And everyone on the Forge, for all they may proclaim their innocence as a way of preserving their "authorship"*, surely works in the light cast by theory.  It's how they aim to improve, to answer the question "Why will this game do anything better than the game I was playing before?"  And sometimes we find rather explicit acknowledgement of theoretical considerations in excellent games: I see this in MLWM's physics of relationships, and even more clearly in IAWA's direct hacking of the transcript.<br><br>Tim, if your argument is that 90% of the time, taking theory as prescriptive leads to crud, I agree wholeheartedly.  Postmodernism is susceptible to being used as a fig-leaf for lazy or just plain poor work.  But it's also capable of leading us to a mature consideration of the whole medium, and of giving us sophisticated tools for making that medium go into new places in exciting ways.  At the minimum, designing toward an aesthetic theory is no more likely to lead to bad results than designing without a theory in mind; at its best, it is groundbreaking.<br><br/>* I feel like postmodernism in this medium isn't especially mature yet, and this is a main reason why. The notion of authorship hasn't come under the same scrutiny as (say) rules ontology, and so an unexamined and na\xefve model persists that might see appropriation as damaging to creator-hood.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197434/#Comment_197434" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T12:33:40+00:00" title="March 17, 2009 12:33PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2009 12:48PM by Graham.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin, how are you using the word postmodern, here?

It's informed by my failure to run Everway in 2001, Scott Knipe's failure to run Sorcerer later that same year, my success running The Pool, and all the phone conversations I had with my friend Tom, with Scott Knipe, and with Ron Edwards during that time trying to understand how to prep, and how to truly treat player characters as protagonists. It was 90% mechanically intact for a playtest at Gen Con 2002. It's an instantiation of techniques I found creatively and collaboratively satisfying, and my ideas about controlling relationships and about treating the end of play as a creative destination, and not really the product of working from theory.

At some point Ron did a re-write and created a PDF...<i> (checks a couple different websites)</i>... ummm, I'm going to guess that was in 1998. If that's correct, than he would have done the re-write at around the same time as the "System Does Matter" article.

I'm not sure how it differs from the earlier PDF version, if at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my point, Colin (ccreitz), is that your assertions simply aren't the way things went down. If there's been some sort of integration of theory and design, it's only come about, umm... in the last 2, maybe 3 years.

I'm sorry if I said anything that would have muddied my use of the term; I didn't mean anything unusual by it.  I guess the controversial assertion would be that Forge games are generally postmodern, right?  Or that the key aesthetic distinction in this particular medium, so far, has been pre-theoretical vs postmodern?  I think it would be a bit of a thread derail to discuss that, but it might be an interesting topic for a new thread.<br><br>Paul, there is no one better-qualified as you to answer Don (the OP's) questions.  Also, this thread is turning into a scholarly bonanza!  At any rate, thank you for your explanation. I think that your account of its development here is compatible with my assertion that MLWM is a theory-aware game, if not (for historical reasons) a Forge-theory-aware game.  In particular, I saw the rules as physics of <i>relationships</i> as embodying ideas, at some level of realization, like "the rules don't need to be gameworld physics of arrows and armor" \u2014 that is to say, as a critique of what would later be called simulationism-by-default \u2014 and "system does matter" ("design what matters" really).   But maybe I'm seeing things that aren't there.  If you wouldn't mind answering a couple of follow-up questions, it would go a long way toward clarifying the role of theory in your successful design.<br><br>You mention that your motivation for the design choices in MLWM stemmed from some successes and some failures (Everway... sigh.  I want you to work so badly, but no one can make you go.  Why do you tease us?).  I imagine that you bent some effort toward explaining why you succeeded some times, and failed others.  At what level of abstraction did you explain those things?  Was it, to use a term of art perhaps anachronistically, just a question of good technique vs bad technique?  Or did you sketch a more general idea of what made a game more or less fun, an informal or folk theory?  If the latter, to what extent do you think that that emerging explanation was an influence on the theory(ies) developed on the Forge?<br/><br/>It is especially interesting to me, given his prominence in the ensuing discussion, to what extent Edwards saw your work as generalizable.  Probably we'd have to ask him, but if you have a feeling about this, I'm very curious.<br/><br/>Paul, call me on this if I'm wrong, but: when the Old Ones developed the first RPGs, their goals were either inchoate, or they would have phrased them in the terms of foregoing, na\xefve games.  They would have said something about "balance", about differentiation of effect on the game between different characters, things like that.  When you designed MLWM, you had in mind different kinds of role-playing experiences, and an agenda of directing play toward one class of results and away from another based on criteria like "protagonism" and "creative satisfaction".  Most interestingly to me, you moved the terms of fiction criticism straight into the rules, while describing what you were doing as fiction creation, which is an essentially postmodern move.  When I think of designing with a theory in mind \u2014 and in particular, an explanation of good role-playing games as against good other kinds of creative endeavors \u2014 that's precisely what I imagine.  I don't suppose that you or anyone went around spouting slogans like Nth Internationalists or anything like that!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197496/#Comment_197496" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T16:35:09+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  4:35PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, we crossposted.  Don't you think that the notoriety of games like <i>Sorcerer</i> and its peers might have in fact been a major influence on those "lucky design choices" and experimentation?  And that at least some of those choices were informed by an explicit attempt to find out what makes role-playing games beautiful? From where I stand, it seems like there was considerable cross-fertilization, technical and critical, among game designers starting sometime shortly after 2000, in a way that wasn't true previously.  In particular, I don't feel like there was a critical conversation (beyond the walls of any one room) happening at all until the late 90s*, and it seems to me that it took off in the early 2000s, maybe because of dropping barriers to game publication and an increase in the population of designers and folks interested in design.<br/><br/>Some details of my chronology definitely are wrong, and I'm sorry.  It's the best I could do in the time I've been able to spend in following and reconstructing trends in design; your responses have been quite valuable in pointing me in the right direction.  But honestly the narrative in outline seems to make sense and to account well for commonalities among games designed in the past 5-10 years, and in particular for games designed in the era (which I feel was well underway by 2003, but would welcome correction) where the conversation, in English at least, has been largely dominated by the arguments started on the Forge.<br/><br/>* I think that White Wolf's decision around 1998 to start publishing designer articles on their web site was important in this regard, as was the Hogshead New Style line, some of which took the form of critique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197568/#Comment_197568" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T09:58:49+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  9:58AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2009 9:59AM by Valamir.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm seeing alot of confusion around the notion of "theory designed games"<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me simplify based on the way I see it.  I'll claim no special knowledge other than someone who spent absurd amounts of time on the Forge back in the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdea One:  There exists games numerous enough to be worth categorizing that were designed as a concious effort by the designer sitting down with the "Current State of Forge Theory Discussions" and saying "I'm going to design a game founded on the principles espoused in these theory discussions.  I'm going to analyze my social contract and creative agenda and select fortune techniques and stances and various ephemera specifically to achieve the desired Creative Agenda".<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the best of my knowledge this never happened.  Or if it did, extremely rarely and solely as a mental exercise.  I know of no published product designed in this fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIdea Two:  There existed a number of people who, in various places and with varying degrees of active involvement participated in, or at least followed the heady days of RPG Theory discussions -- largely at the Forge but also spilling over from RPGnet, Gaming Outpost, and long before any of them Use Net...and later out into the blogosphere.  Whether these people eagerly embraced the theory's assertions, actively pushed to expand or develop them further, rejected them outright, shrugged and went on with their lives, or pursued their own variants; this period of time instilled in a generation of game designers a way of thinking about design that rejected any notion of "just the way things are done" or "thats what an RPG is supposed to look like" in favor of making specific choices to achieve specific results.  That culture produced the vast majority of "indie" designs from 2001-2005.  That culture has since dispersed, and broken up into smaller centers of "thinking about design" that often are very different from the more monolithic days when the Forge dominated the center of the theory discussion universe.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHIS...yes...this happened alot.  You'd be hard pressed to find an indie title that wasn't touched at least a little by this process.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Colin, I think your overall notion is pretty sound.  There is definitely a large difference in how designers thought about design pre-2000ish and how designers think about design today.  That line could best be thought of as a range of dates with 2000-2001 being the primitive early stages, 2001-2004 being the peak production years, 2004-2005 or 6 being the winding down years, and 2005-today being the dispersion and beginning of the next evolutionary stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut phrases like "decided to write toward a theory" overstates the reality by a pretty wide margin.  "became generally more aware of the possibilities and began making deliberate choices to explore them" would be a more accurate depiction, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197569/#Comment_197569" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T10:00:47+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 10:00AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Forge and games produced there are actually very structuralist, not especially postmodern.

I'd say that the latter is more prevalent.  If Forge games are structuralist, they are so in a way specifically critical of the old, unreflective regime.  I think that the most important effect of Forgery has been the identification of sim-by-default, and its widespread rejection.<br><br>Even if we come to agree that a lit-crit person would recognize the terms of our discussion here as structuralist, in my view, applying the "structuralism" of literary theory to game-design theory isn't going to give literary-structuralist results.  It is a radical maneuver that undermines sim-by-default and the other assumptions of na\xefve design, and recognizes (imposes?) a kinship between two quite different bodies of technique; it characterizes the output of an RPG as first-class fiction (as opposed to a description of fiction, say), right?

Over the course of 6 years we've played maybe half a dozen times a year while tweaking and rehauling the new system.  Now that its pretty much to a place where we can play through sessions without making comments on the system. (it has ultimately faded to the background for better or worse and we take it for granted that we are using it and not something else)<br>\n<br>\nDuring the course of the design, I found story-games and the forge.  I never devoted myself to figuring it all out, but the emphasis on \u201cwhat exactly are we trying to do here\u201d was something that stuck with me.  We started out with a very broad notion of a 'mission statement' and then as we got closer to a finished product we were able to tighten up our concepts.<br>\n<br/>\nI wanted to include theory in the manual, not because it would add anything to the playability of the game (no matter how much someone tells me why a movie is great or why certain camera techniques are great it never equates to my enjoying the movie) but rather, because anyone who is going to consider playing an indie-rpg is the kind of person who knows something about rpg-theory.  I just wanted to make sure that before someone opened the pdf, they could read a sort of introduction to it which would distinguish it from all the other hundred or so RPs.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention I just graduated with a philosophy degree so I figured that if I learned anything about philosophy I should be able to usefully apply it to RPing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccounting for Taste hit the nail on the head; playtesting is the key problem since everyone in my group is either in college or grad-school.  If you guys would be willing to play a few games for us that would be awesome.  I'll have to talk to the guys about making it ready for submission first.  It should be ready no later than the end of this semester. (Unless school gets really busy)<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain thanks for all the help.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197641/#Comment_197641" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T13:25:56+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  1:25PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Structuralist, or formalist?</blockquote>In lit-crit terms, structuralist (understanding things as complex constructions of constituent parts) instead of formalist (analyzing a text based on the structure of the text).

As soon as I cracked open Egri, or rather, as soon as I checked the publication date, I was able to put Egri and large portions of the Big Model into structuralist terms, in which they make perfect sense, and stopped trying to apply post-structuralist and postmodern thought to the ideas, which is just crazy-making.  It also contextualizes Big Model, making sense of later developments (roughly, what Ralph is calling the next evolutionary stage 2005-present) which start poking and prodding at the edges of the Big Model.<br/><br/>Or in other words, most schools of thought require a stage where definitions are made and theses are presented, and then a stage where those definitions and theses can be challenged to produce a deeper understanding of the whole picture.  Big Model put forward a lot of definitions and theses; these days we're examining them and turning them inside-out and applying them to each other and seeing where things break down or hide deeper meaning.  And \u2014 in a vain attempt to drag this back to OP \u2014 the best tools we have for testing what has come before is with play experiences and game designs that create those play experiences.  In a real way, we shove games into the cracks of theory and see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197643/#Comment_197643" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T13:38:25+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  1:38PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Seriously, this is a prevalent and totally inaccurate misunderstanding about the products of the Forge.

Along the lines of "Postulated: The output (epiphenomenon, whatever) of an RPG can be fiction.  When this is true, how does that change our approach to both the game and its output?"  And again, I'm with you 100% on the fact that there's a lot of sophisticated sim enthusiasm and discussion on the Forge and in the many places where its sparks have landed \u2014 most of the time, I'm in that boat myself \u2014 but to get to that point, it was important to understand that sim-by-default was an arbitrary convention of game design, a historical accident.<br><br>Edit to add: ...in addition to enthusiasm about the whole spectrum of creative agenda, also a lot of enthusiasm for exploring the consequences of changing the other elements of the model, and for exploring an ever-widening diversity of technique.  I share that enthusiasm, but I keep finding myself talking about the (I think super-crucial) identification of sim-by-default, and its analysis, just because I feel like it is foundational to the changes in game design over the past few years.  I don't mean to imply that there aren't a lot of other interesting questions of aesthetics in game design and play.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197688/#Comment_197688" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T17:57:25+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  5:57PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: outsider</cite>I wanted to include theory in the manual, not because it would add anything to the playability of the game (no matter how much someone tells me why a movie is great or why certain camera techniques are great it never equates to my enjoying the movie) but rather, because anyone who is going to consider playing an indie-rpg is the kind of person who knows something about rpg-theory.</blockquote>\nIncidentally the latter is really, really not true.
