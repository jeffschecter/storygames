This is particularly true for the question "What do the players do?"

Because it's okay to mention that in the biblography (look to shows like this!)<br/>\nEspecially if you mention several shows to help set the mood. Hammer House of Horror, perhaps? <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that might make your game a little cooler, is to have players define their own version of evil. You don't have to make the GM do all that.<br/>\nIt might give the GM a few vital clues.<br/>\n<br/>\n(EDITED BECAUSE OF MY LOUSY GRAMMAR)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155030/#Comment_155030" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T17:55:55+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  5:55PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Sean, this is cool.

I have started work on the setting but I am still ironing it out.  Another problem I am dealing with is how much comedy to put in.  On the one hand, I can see a Get Smart setup but focused on horror instead of the cold war.  In that case, I know there was a show called Good vs. Evil which might apply but corruption would look like the movie 976 Evil where accepting the bargain transform the NPC (or PC!) into a supernatural creature and they would immediately be after additional victims.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, the shows I listed above got their humor from what I call enforced moralism.  The death of the victim was usually done in an entertaining manner and tied into the lesson of the show.   Additionally, there was unintended humor by having actors in stock roles.  However, I see more potential for laughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I am trying to mix up the message of what is evil.  For instance, I am working on the corruption mechanics for cursed items.  Basically, the roll is made after they touch the item.  If the items wins, they immediately start using it.  If not, it waits for an approporiate trigger.  The owner of the item doesn't know the nature of it until they get rid of it (if they get rid it, it is not because they know it is evil) or use it for the first time.  At the point, they are corrupted.  There is a second battle over maliciousness.  In other words, the item wants to screw over the owner while the owner wants to keep using it for the set price.   Some items ask for a life to be taken while others ask for different evil acts.  i.e. there is a statue of cupid which requires the owner to destroy a loving relationship before they can use the item to seduce someone of the opposite sex for one night.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, I am trying to make wiggle room for different views on what evil is.  Another course might be to do something like make different groups which are tied to good and focus on different types of evil.  Therefore, the right to censor might focus on vulgar TV, ads, etc. while the Golden Argonants might want to keep evil items out of the hands of people.  Those groups would only be samples and the PCs could form their idea of what evil is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSetting beginnings of DAE!<br/>\n<br/>\nEra: Modern Day<br/>\nGenre: Horror with Dark Comedy<br/>\n<br/>\nThe organization of Good and Evil is the first thing for me to hit on here. Good and Evil can cooperate within their own groups and there are beings who command respect on both sides. Taking charge is possible but disrupting either group is harder than it seems. Specific information is needed before any corruption or redemption can begin. In other words, evil beings will cooperate in the game world more than they might in the real world. Another feature is that good doesn't win over evil but the world is balanced and stays that way over time. Bureaucracy plays a role in each group. Each subgroup has its own protocols to make things happen. The effort can be played up for comedic effort but it should never truly frustrate players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe characters are roughly divided into four categories based on how they learned about the supernatural. In all cases, a voice, vision or other means have given them a charge. The players are hit over the head with the effect, which reminds of what they are doing. Of course, the GM or players can use this feature to push their own narration.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaised - They have lived the supernatural all of their lives. Their parent(s) are heavily involved, either as occultists or other supernatural entity. Another possibility might be that they have powers of their own such as visions or other abilities which set them apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nRevealed - Someone has told them and showed them the true nature of the world. This source could be books, a person, or an encounter which proved itself to the character. They have come to this realization later in life but there are some advantages as well as disadvantages.<br/>\n<br/>\nRedeemed - This person has once delved into forbidden activity but they have resisted and turned away. Maybe they used a cursed item in the past or they were possessed at one point. They have tasted evil and now have to deal with what they have done in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nReviled - Those are people who still do evil things but they have successfully hidden those activities. They are respectabe people in most eyes but they have their dark secrets.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegulars - This catchall category is for everyone who does not know what is going on. They are just "regular" people trying to get by.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hour grows late but I had some questions to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Organization - how much comedy? I am aiming for a level between Get Smart and TV shows of the 80s.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Characters - what are the types that just have to be in the game? I am dividing them based on how they are connected to the struggle of good vs. evil.  Desirable Love Interest, Old Man with a Book, Nerdy Ned type (name your stereotype here). I plan on giving each of them a special ability that works only when the player stays in character.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Humor - Puns and jokes, irony, satire?  I definitely want to encourage the GM and players to do thisIn other words, I am trying to figure out how much to put in.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Jumpstart - Despite the above, I have cool ideas in my head but I can't dig them out. Feel free to make any suggestions to flesh this idea out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
