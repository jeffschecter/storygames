Having just wrapped up PTA:  The Big Store and then some secret playtesting, we all got together and, instead of playing anything, came to game night with a pitch idea.  We each went through a concept we'd love to play, then each idea got discussed and refined.  Then we picked one to start next week, and put two others on the schedule to follow it, with the prospective GMs on notice to prepare.  So now we have an outline of the next, I dunno, 20 sessions.  It's pretty sweet.  We've never done that before, and it was very satisfying.  Also, hanging out and explicitly not playing - also very nice.  So for my Wednesday group, it'll be:<br/><br/>Slaves of the Great King (TSOY epic fantasy)<br/>Shank's Mare (PTA super gritty old west)<br/>Conquistadors (PTA Valley of Mexico, 1519)<br/><br/>With missed sessions and so on, that's probably enough to take us to the new year, and we have really good pitches in the wings. Have you ever done this?  Did it work out?<br/><br/>Fun!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208577/#Comment_208577" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T12:47:44+00:00" title="May 21, 2009 12:47PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, we did this in my former weekly group and it worked great. We explicitly did five-session series with an "option to renew" and add another 2-5 sessions if necessary.<br/><br/>After doing this for a while, we started to drop little elements in to tie some of the series together. So, stuff from the Space Fantasy TSOY game cropped up in the Dictionary of Mu and then stuff from that fusion was referenced in the SotC game. That was fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208578/#Comment_208578" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T12:49:58+00:00" title="May 21, 2009 12:49PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's worth remembering.
