None of the players had any experience with the game and I knew only one of the players from a game last year. I started off with a short introduction into the setting, highlighting the aspects of the Faith which would come into play in the town. One thing that seems to be inherent to Dogs is the tendency of new players to make snap judgements with their characters, trying to nail NPCs on some slip of the tongue and generally build their characters up to be McCarthyist witch hunters. One player was especially prone to this which before long led to a lot of infighting among the Dogs. (He later said that years of playing Vampire had hardened him to character violence and injustice, which I think might have been one of the reasons for this). In fact, all of the conflicts we played were mostly about arguments about how to proceed. Only the very first conflict included an NPC opposing them in some way. Still the way they played out was riveting and exciting and I realized that there was a simple reason for this.<br/><br/><b>Narration is slave to the character and slave to the world.<br/></b><br/>Whenever somebody wanted to roll in a new trait, Raise or See their narration had to fit the character and make sense as part of the game world. I tried to made sure that everybody kept an eye on that. Something that we handled a little more loosely in my regular group (with both Dogs and Galactic), which weakened the overall experience. This is probably obvious to all of you, but it helped me to realize that being strict about these things - even though they occasionally lead to no-win situations for some players - strengthens the overall game and makes it far more involving. Once you accept that your character is simply screwed sometimes (regardless of whether you can come up with a bit of narration to help him out), the story gains much more weight and the situations become more intense.  <br/><br/>It's a bit of a contradiction of course. Both character and world are after all just the sum of more or less freely chosen narration, but holding integrity of character and world sacrosanct is essential for the game to work. Evolving one or the other is ok, radically changing them to have your character come out on top or to steer the story in another direction is not. <br/><br/>Any other "things you mustn't forget when playing"-advice?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97061/#Comment_97061" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T02:27:58+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  2:27AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>To Give is better than to Take</b> (more Fallout that is)<br/><br/>You see, this "no-win" situation players find themselves in are more often than not an intrinsic part of pacing. Take for instance, the DitV NPCs - You roll them up, and assign traits on the spot. Why is that so? IMHO, it's a pacing mechanism: In the first conflict with an NPC, the GM has good chances to win, because he can easily find aspects the Dog(s) currently can't hold up against. BUT as he is revealing them during the conflict, the Dogs are at an advantage in following conflicts - You can send a Dog that handles the NPC's traits better, or wait for/create a situation where the aspects are disadvantageous to the NPC. It all leads to a common form of story - getting to know your opposition while losing, but winning in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97068/#Comment_97068" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T03:19:52+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  3:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ooohhh... very nice.

It falls apart and becomes just a highly modified version of Yahtzee. That's why the reflection phase after the town is important. It's there that you talk about what you thought about the characters you met and/or played. It's where everybody at the table gets to hear other people's take on this story they just finished. Although paying close attention never to criticise or judge the player for how I perceived his character and talking about how I felt about the NPCs I've played.<br/><br/>I don't believe in making players care about NPCs or their lot. It runs too close to emotional manipulation for me. But I do want to make it easy for the players to care, if they choose to do so. I don't want to put stumbling blocks in the way of sympathy. That's why I try to avoid black hat villains in my games. They're just people. Everyone of them. Even the sorcerers are just trying to do the right thing. They are (or at least used to be) good people who made mistakes and wrong choices for which others had to pay the price.
