We just made characters (actually, as I write this, I still have to play the iniciation for one of my two players (my brothers, actually) but he had a head ache and fell asleep, gonna do that later).<br/><br/>The thing is, after having done the fist character, Brother Self, we played his initiation:<br/><br/>The Achievement was: "I wish I had fasted for a whole day without complaining" The initial stage was his dormitory; the opposition, an instructor who couldn't stand Bro. Self for being a smart-ass.<br/><br/>The conflict went like this: The instructor stated the Bro. Self had to prove himself as worthy as he thought he was himself. So he had to fast for a day following into the steps of a prophet in the book of life, and not complain at all.<br/><br/>Later, while the character was doing some hard labor, the instructor would go supervise while having a big, juicy piece of turkey. The character raised by claiming he was too strong willed to be tempted.<br/><br/>Later, again, while dinner was happening, Bro. Self decided to not get to the dinning room, and so avoid temptation. The instructor sent two thugs to drag the him there, and so it escalated to physical.<br/><br/>After they dragged him (he took the blow) The conflict deescalated to verbal again, with the character having a big glass of water (in order to bring in his "I'm a quick drinker" trait into play) and the instructor calling in some scripture claiming the prophet had not had water during his fasting.<br/><br/>And so the conflict was lost over a technicality (yes, the character exhausted his dice)<br/><br/>The thing is... the conflict deescalated... I was really confused, but I tryed to go with it as well as I could... what have you done in situations like this? did I miss something in the book?</span><br/><br/><span style="color: purple;">Also, unrelated, how can you translate Steward to spanish...

You can start with guns, and escalate to talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanically, escalation is simply moving into a new arena of conflict and getting new dice for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dealing with fallout, the fallout is based on the narration, not the "current level" of escalation. So you can start out talking, escalate to physical, then go back to talking. Mechanically, nothing happens when you return to talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in the case you gave, he did go the whole day without complaining, didn't he? He may have technically lost the conflict, but it could be that he learned something more valuable from losing than from winning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I answered your question.

No problem at all. Just be sure <b>not</b> to re-roll the dice you've already rolled for verbal. I see it this way: When a conflict escalates and you roll dice for that escalation, you bring that escalation in narratively with your raise or see, whichever one is next. From then on, your character can do whatever, provided he's rolled stat dice for it at some point. If he wants to do something that he hasn't rolled stat dice for, well, that's escalation.<br><br>So I'm trying to argue down my drunken father, and he escalates to physical, raising by trying to push past me? If I also escalate to physical, I see that raise by blocking his path with my burly self. Then I raise by quoting from the Book of Life, "The King frowns on the Father who acts the child"? Totally kosher. I don't have to keep going at it physically unless I want to.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197088/#Comment_197088" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T22:09:05+00:00" title="March 15, 2009 10:09PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br>The game was translated into Italian.

But you aren't required to. If you're physical but not fighting, you can dodge a bullet or a blow and not pick up the shooting dice (assuming you've got 'em left). Your next raise can be to tell him that violence doesn't solve anything. On the other hand, you can dodge the bullet and grab your shooting dice, then raise the same way. However, if you choose to shoot after that, you don't get to grab your shooting dice, because you've already used them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197097/#Comment_197097" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T22:34:04+00:00" title="March 15, 2009 10:34PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm actually curious about this point:<br><br>Do you have to match your opponent's escalation?

So here's what I'm getting from the ESCALATION section, but there may be more on the subject in other parts of the book I'm not getting.<br/><br/>p. 60<br/><br/>There's a description of not having the dice to see someone's raise, so the player escalates to fist-fighting. The text then says this:<br/><br/>"Now <i>I</i> don't have the dice to see <i>your</i> raise. If I don't want to Give, I have to Escalate to match."<br/><br/>He has to Escalate or Give, but it's not because he automatically has to Give if he doesn't choose to Escalate. It's because, in this case, if he doesn't Escalate he won't have the dice to meet the raise. So we're still in the dark, but we know that this isn't saying "If you don't Escalate like your opponent, you're out of the conflict." It may very well say that somewhere else, though, so I'll keep leafing through the book and see if there's any more illumination.<br/><br/>I'm convinced more and more that you don't have to escalate.<br/><br/>p. 80, Conflict &amp; Resolution Recap:<br/><br/>"When someone can't See a Raise, or else when someone Gives, that person's out of the conflict."<br/><br/>That's all it says on going out of conflict. To me, that says implicitly, "these are the only ways of losing a conflict." If that's the case, then you're not automatically out of the conflict when someone else Escalates and you don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197108/#Comment_197108" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T23:13:17+00:00" title="March 15, 2009 11:13PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't have to escalate                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197110/#Comment_197110" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T23:19:44+00:00" title="March 15, 2009 11:19PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

The only difference between Dogs and Afraid wrt escalation is that in Afraid, sometimes when you escalate you get a free block or dodge.<br/><br/>I wish I'd thought of "when you escalate, you escalate the whole conflict" three years ago.<br/><br/>-Vincent"<br/><br/>In which he seems to contradict himself. He says that Dogs plays like Afraid does: "when you escalate, you escalate the whole conflict", and then he says "I wish I'd thought of that three years ago", being when he published Dogs, which makes it sound like it's <i>not</i> in Dogs. Argh!<br/><br/>But then he says this, which clears it up:<br/><br/>"No, this is not new. This is how Dogs has always worked.<br/><br/>How I've said it before is, if someone shoots at you, ducking the bullet counts as escalating to gunfighting. You get those dice just for making an appropriate (thus, escalatory) see. That's functionally identical to 'if you escalate, you escalate the whole conflict.' "<br/><br/>So the correct ruling is: <b>When someone else escalates, you also get your dice for that escalation, however you decide to play it out in the RP.</b><br/><br/>However, it's <i>not</i> "If you choose not to escalate with them, you're out of the conflict." You don't even get to choose. You just get those dice for that other person escalating, free. Vincent says it this way:<br/><br/>"Very, very occasionally, someone will be all proud of a character who someone punched them and they declined to roll their body and/or will dice, to make a pacifistic point. I've always considered this to be a harmless violation of the rules: I guess I'm not going to make you roll the dice you're entitled to, if you really don't want them.<br/><br/>You're entitled to them though."<br/><br/>You can, of course, Give when the other person escalates, but that has no bearing on what's happening with the dice. It's just the "You can Give at any time" rule.<br/><br/>I've always thought of Dogs as very well-written and clear, and Vincent as a good writer, but my own problems in play and now this are making me question that.

When I said escalating the conflict is ass-backwards, I meant this: I escalate MYSELF when I pull my pistol and shoot. You escalate yourself when you dodge. If you choose not to react in a gunfighty manner by dodging, you've not escalated... Hence, I didn't escalate the conflict, I only escalated for myself.

"See: I dive behind the woodpile" - no, not so much.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197313/#Comment_197313" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T19:27:26+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  7:27PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well there we go.

This is why I disagree with the rule that diving behind a barrel should net you your gunfighting dice. That IS the rule, which is why I explained as such above, but I disagree with it. I feel that you should only get those gunfighting dice if you're pulling a gun out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if you were to start at talking and work your way up through physical and fighting before getting to guns, then you don't get any new dice for the escalation anyway, except where you get to roll in your gun dice and any shooting traits, so it's not always a big deal either way. When it comes down to it though, even if you go back to talking after shooting, then you've still risked shooting a man and killing him, if you managed to make him take the blow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197509/#Comment_197509" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T18:45:49+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  6:45PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember also that if you just talk to your opponent in the middle of a gunfight, you're changing the fallout you inflict, but probably not the fallout you suffer.
