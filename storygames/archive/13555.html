It\u2019s collaborative, but with a goal of feeling like a single-GM role playing game; you have a PC, you develop it from session to session, but you also have a set of story characters that are \u201cyours\u201d the same way your PC is \u201cyours\u201d.  Here\u2019s the premise:<br/><br/>The Vele were a long-lived race and worshiped the god of knowledge, mercy, and compassion.  They befriended the Scrow, a \u201clesser\u201d race, worshippers of a barbarian god of schemes and warfare, and gave to them knowledge and fantastic, almost magical, devices.  The Scrow executed a plan lasting more than 1600 years, culminating in the destruction of the Vele during a single night, destroying the Vele and their cities with their own weapons, followed by world domination.  Now, there are few, if any, Vele left, and their cities are in ruins.<br/><br/>Given that premise, the setting is up to you: Steampunk, Old West, Ancient Japan, Space Opera, Postapocalyptic, Egyptech, Renaissance, Dark Ages, Aztec, Pulp, Dystopian Future,  Multiplanar,... whatever works.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re interested in play testing, please send me an email: bill (dot) burdick (at) gmail (dot) com<br/><br/><br/>Bill Burdick                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306616/#Comment_306616" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-02T19:10:45+00:00" title="January  2, 2011  7:10PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is a link to the reformatted and expanded rules, which also includes the new, spotlight mechanic, not in the old version:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B32MRkbkRMqbOGUwMWZlOTYtZjhkYS00Nzc4LWFhMmYtOWQ2ZTVmMjU1N2I3&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B32MRkbkRMqbOGUwMWZlOTYtZjhkYS00Nzc4LWFhMmYtOWQ2ZTVmMjU1N2I3&amp;hl=en</a><br/><br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
