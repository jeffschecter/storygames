Game sessions will be 2 and 3 hours.<br/><br/>Another idea that's on the table is a <i>Superhero Wedding</i>.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Characters</span><br/>- Marrying superhero couple<br/>- Superheroes in disguise (ca. 2/3 of players; looking normal, hiding secret identity &amp; power)<br/>- Ordinary people (ca. 1/3 of players; lovers, press)<br/>- 1 Superhero Villain<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Game play</span><br/>Each player gets a character card with specific information. Facilitator guides through the scenes. Scenes are played out in-character.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenes</span><br/>- Greeting: marrying superhero couple reveals themself, welcomes all guests<br/>- Partners: lovers reveal themselves, choose their partner<br/>- Jealousy: one of the characters (superhero) chooses a love interest among the couples, creating jealousy/rivalry.<br/>- Revelation: press characters gets to reveal the identity of one other character.<br/>- Attack: Villain chooses victim and attacks (i.e. transform oxygen around victim), the closest superheor next to victim may use superpower (i.e. slow time)<br/>- Wish: each (surviving) character writes a wish for the rest of the wedding, wraps the paper and places it in a bowl. Facilitator randomly picks 3 wishes, paraphrases appropriate events for the rest of the wedding<br/>- Goodbye: all guests say goodbye and leave the wedding.<br/><br/><br/>Any ideas on this? Does this sound workable/interesting? Any other similar or useable games?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
