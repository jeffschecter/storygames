                    I posted this over on rpg.net and a local forum originally, but it was suggested I crosspost it here, so here you go!<br/>
<br/>
Battlestar Fujiyama <br/>
<br/>
The commander is dead, the colonies of Kobol have been destroyed, and Cylons look like us. Without unity, humanity will die, but dark fates lurk in the survivorâ€™s hearts. Battlestar Fujiyama is an alternate setting for the Mountain Witch. <br/>
<br/>
Characters: <br/>
<br/>
Characters in Battlestar Fujiyama are much like their counterparts in the Mountain Witch, but with some important differences. For one, they are the command staff of a surviving Battlestar, and are not alone. The Dark Fates and backgrounds are likely to be different, but this is a much more cosmetic difference than the group dynamic. <br/>
<br/>
The Dark Fates: <br/>
<br/>
Cylon Agent: <br/>
You are a Cylon. Will your interaction with humans cause you to sympathize with them, or will you fulfill your mission, despite the emotional attachments you may form? <br/>
Season One Examples: Spoilers! <br/>
<br/>
Cylon Pact: <br/>
You have made, or been tricked into a bargain with the Cylons themselves. They will give you what you want and attempt to keep you alive, but will you be able to bear this burden? <br/>
Season One Examples: Gaius Baltar <br/>
<br/>
Desperately in Love: <br/>
You would do anything for the one you care most about. Is it love, or obsession? Are they what they appear? <br/>
Season One Examples: Chief Tyrol <br/>
<br/>
Personal Demons: <br/>
You have a habit, fear, or addition. During peacetime, this didnâ€™t interfere with your duties too much, but your performance now is vital. Will you rise above your demons, or will they consume you? <br/>
Season One Examples: Colonel Thai <br/>
<br/>
Revenge: <br/>
Another member of the command staff wronged you long ago, and you still carry vengeful thoughts. Can you forgive them? How will you make them pay? <br/>
Season One Examples: Apollo <br/>
<br/>
Ulterior Motives: <br/>
You have an overreaching agenda that is far more important to you than the petty concerns of human survival. What do you want? How will you get it? Will you unite with your companions, or discard them to achieve your goals? <br/>
Season One Examples: Tom Zarek <br/>
<br/>

*(All zodiacal characterizations are taken more or less verbatim from Wikipedia. They are not intended to be a commentary on the personalities of any characters from the show of known planetary origin, nor are they intended to be a guideline to Colonial internal politics.) <br/>
<br/>
Abilities: <br/>
<br/>
Pick two abilities for your character. Your character is a Colonial Officer and is presumed to be competent at the basic skills needed to serve in that position, these include basic computer and systems operation, unarmed and armed combat, military protocol, giving and following orders, and basic space transportation. <br/>
<br/>
One of your abilities should be related to your characterâ€™s typical â€˜role,â€™ such as Starbuckâ€™s Viper-piloting, Baltarâ€™s expansive science knowledge, or Gaetaâ€™s computer and technical savvy. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, pick a Contact for your character. This is some NPC who your character is likely to rely upon or be in repeated contact with. You may call upon your Contact to create a scene with them at any time. Contacts are usually considered Able NPCs, unless the GM has a reason to rule particularly otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
Rank: <br/>
<br/>
At the start of the game, the chain of command is frakked. Starting characters can hold the rank of Lieutenant, Captain, or Major. If you want your character to be eligible for command, you should hold the rank of Major. If you donâ€™t want to command, you should take the rank of Lieutenant.                </div>
