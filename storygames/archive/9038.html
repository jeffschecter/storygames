I don't know if there is a weird anthropology usage of it that departs from common use! I'd be more inclined to say, "A set of traditions that arise from the interaction of a people with themselves and their environment."<br/><br/>But uh dorky definition-tuning aside, the really important thing we're trying to express here is, a culture isn't *causeless.* Every tradition that a culture encompasses came about from an interaction of needs, resources, and constraints, and that tradition can act as a constraint on other traditions.<br/><br/>That's a pretty rough thing, but Jason, you said you had some ideas about how to express that idea systematically.

Jared Diamond popularized the idea, apparently (taking his bibliography as evidence, as I'm not an expert myself) already widely held, that a culture is a tool for making people out of a place - feeding them, clothing them, and generally defending them against Weather, Wilderness, Animals, and Humans.  He analyzed cultures in terms of their stability with respect to their ecologies, taking into account the interaction of cultures as an ecological factor, and concluded that (1) it is possible to explain the outcomes of intercultural contacts by reference to those underlying ecologies and (2) we can usefully analyze the ecological sustainability of a given culture as a possible contributor to its eventual decline.<br/><br/>It's come up in other popular accounts, as well.  For example, Michael Pollan popularized a view of food culture as an adaptation, powered like other adaptations by repeated correction from a hostile environment, that allows humans to figure out what is or isn't food - this is very hard problem, as anyone (myself included) who has ever had to hunt and gather in the wild can attest.<br/><br/>I can't say for sure that Jason was proceeding from these premises, and he has a reasonable claim to being the expert here.  But they seem reasonable enough to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199819/#Comment_199819" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T17:42:48+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  5:42PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2009 5:44PM by J_Walton.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I would add to this discussion is that... While cultures don't blossom out of nowhere, the ultimate *cause* of various cultural elements is often impossible to identify or may no longer be relevant.  For example, take, uh, the US Electoral College.  Clearly, the folks who invented the Electoral College meant it to do certain things.  However, if you asked most people, even civicly-engaged people, why the Electoral College exists and does what it does, they have no idea and may even suggest that we abolish it as outdated.<br/><br/>In fact, I would say this is an inherent trait in cultures in general: cultures are unfathomably conservative, in the sense of conserving everything that has ever been part of the culture.  It's really, really hard, if not impossible, to fully change or get rid of old or otherwise unwanted cultural elements. After 50 years of anti-superstition campaigns by the Nationalist and Communist Parties of China, popular religion has built itself back up.  Does it mean the same thing as it used to?  In many cases, no.  It's often a very new thing wearing the trappings of what came before, reconstructed from what people remember of the old traditions.  But, honestly, that's how the old traditions were constructed in the first place <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So that's really two points:<br/><br/>1) In cultures, old stuff sticks around, long after it should have been outdated; and<br/>2) People create new reasons to be attached to the old stuff, which makes it not old, but new and revitalized.<br/><br/>To me, part of what makes a culture feel deep is the accumulation of often-contradictory traditions, which shows history and development.  (Do we need a new jargon term for this?  I like "crusty cultural build-up"!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199820/#Comment_199820" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T17:47:18+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  5:47PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish we talked about this kind of stuff in history class, instead of like how big our military penises are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199821/#Comment_199821" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T17:59:50+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  5:59PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, in Philosophy circles, the kind of process of reclamation and exaption you're talking about  is sometimes referred to as <i>bricolage</i>.

The first question that comes to mind is "do I need to do this for my game", so here goes:<br/><br/>Under what circumstances do you want a fully realized culture in your games and under what circumstances can you get away with shorthand or very passing glances? <br/><br/>Next question: is it better for many players to kick in their thoughts or is a more unified approach/vision of the culture better? (Does this also change with game circumstances?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199843/#Comment_199843" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T21:28:54+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  9:28PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think you can 'get away' with it under almost any circumstances. You're gonna want a fully realized culture when it's important. If you're playing a D&amp;D dungeon-crawl game where the emphasis is on killing monsters and taking their stuff, you're not going to want to waste a lot of time on culture and other details that aren't going to be important. On the other hand, if you're trying to explore a particular culture such as you might in Grey Ranks (I'd assume) or a particular situation that relates to culture as you might in Shock: (again, I'd assume) then having a culture that feels real is going to be more important.</p>\n<p>Of course, that suggests the opposite scenario where a sketchy culture might be desirable so as to give room for exploration, like in Dogs (not assuming on this one). However, the difference there is that Dogs is less about exploring the culture than it is about exploring yourself when exposed to certain situations.</p>\n<p>This segues nicely into your second question, though it doesn't suggest a pat answer. In Dogs, it's pretty much required that your players have input into the culture, but it's not a collaborative building process. It's culture revealed through play, even where that setting did not previously exist.</p>\n<p>This leads me to muse that a unified approach to culture building might yield a more focused result, but that the result might end up feeling constructed. Culture is frequently a contradictory thing, due to different mores growing up together, interacting with each other, but where neither takes over or displaces the other. An example is the cultural idea that women are treasured and should be protected, but where they're also considered inferior. They interrelate, but in their applications they frequently collide. A group approach might simulate that better than just sitting down to some lonely fun enculturation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199848/#Comment_199848" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T21:50:39+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  9:50PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is a "fully realized culture" even possible in an RPG.

For example, pink is unreservedly a girls' colour in the West now but in Victorian times it was considered too violent for girls and more suitable for boys, many of whom wore dresses. How does that kind of transition happen?<br/><br/>The problem with cultures in gaming if that if they are too weird, too detached from what we know, too full of weird slang or terminology, they represent a significant barrier to entry. Ever tried playing Jorune? It's so damn weird that what is supposed to pass for deep culture becomes instead hooks for adventure, it becomes foreground instead of background.<br/><br/>To a certain extent, there's an argument that deep background is unimportant for a game. Many of us play Traveller but it might as well be New Jersey.

Can I entice you to share?</blockquote>\nSure--though, as I said, I haven't figured this out entirely.<br/><br/>ccreitz is correct, I've read a lot of Diamond and Pollan, though I'd say I'm more influenced in this by Tim Ingold and the phenomenological angle. Ingold makes a major assault on the deep-rooted assumptions of Cartesian dualism, like the idea that we engage the world via culture. Ingold presses the question, where does culture come from, if not from repeated engagement with the world? He winds up with some serious questions for the existence of "culture" at all; instead, you have a particular means of dwelling, a way that people have interacted with a particular landscape. That has an impact on the landscape, and sets a pattern for more people to follow afterward. Culture, then, if it describes anything at all, describes this pattern of behavior that both shapes the landscape and is shaped by it, laid down like tracks overlaying each other for millennia, almost like weaving. For example, look at the U.S. highway system. Most of our major highways were already major trade routes before Columbus arrived. Native American tribes had used them all the way back to the last ice age, because they'd originally been mammoth migration routes.<br/><br/>Jonathan, you made an important point--most people don't know the depth of history woven into their culture. Most people don't realize when they drive down the highway that they're following the ancient migration routes of now-extinct mammoth herds. I think you put it quite well here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>To me, part of what makes a culture feel deep is the accumulation of often-contradictory traditions, which shows history and development. (Do we need a new jargon term for this? I like "crusty cultural build-up"!)</blockquote>\nSo, what I've been working on is kind of to a culture what a lifepath character creation might be to a person--a sped-up version of that process. This could be a pretty fun game in and of itself--I keep thinking of it as a kind of mash-up of <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/Dungeon.aspx" rel="nofollow">How to Host a Dungeon</a> and <a href="http://kallistipress.com/category/my-games/agora/" rel="nofollow">Agora: How Shall We Live?</a><br/><br/>Now, I'll also admit that I'm also an ardent bioregionalist, and bioregionalism is a very big thing for my game, so my game starts with the land itself. And since Willem &amp; I have been going back and forth now on the importance of warm-up games to storyjamming (as <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=199955" rel="nofollow">misuba brought up today in the "Stuff to Watch" thread, and </a><a href="http://thefifthworldsg.blogspot.com/2009/04/storyjammers-journey.html" rel="nofollow">I've been posting about</a> on <a href="http://thefifthworldsg.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">my design diary</a>), I'm also throwing in warm-up games that reiterate this as a <a href="http://thefifthworldsg.blogspot.com/2009/02/creation-stories-character-creation.html" rel="nofollow">creation story</a> that will set the pattern for the main body of play.<br/><br/>That's a lot to achieve, which is one reason I don't have working rules yet. But my basic idea is to try to recreate the same process Ingold outlines. The idea of phases in a lifepath, like you have in <em>Spirit of the Century</em>, could really work here, since there will be identifiable eras that each region will live through, and the question becomes, "How did event X impact your landscape?"<br/><br/>Particularly in a collaborative process, the original reasons for an innovation you added in the first round may be entirely forgotten by the end, but the practice may well still endure. My hope is that you'll have a people and a landscape intimately woven together, with rich history and traditions. Rather than being associated randomly with characters, they'll spring from the landscape itself, and they'll come up in scenes set in those places. To bring that down to earth, you might have "the wave" associated with a stadium, and "prayer" associated with a church. So a person associated with the church always leans towards praying, but he'd still do the wave at the stadium. (Though that's another one of those bioregional influences of mine)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200031/#Comment_200031" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T17:51:05+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  5:51PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Perhaps this discussion could start with what a more deeply portrayed culture gains you as a roleplayer and what particular aspects are important to get you there.

As you say, "full" is probably not possible. Think of Alfred Korzybski's maxim, "The map is not the territory." The only full, one-to-one, perfect map would be the territory itself; likewise, the only fully-realized culture would be the culture itself. But that doesn't mean we can't make a better map of the territory, or a richer, deeper reflection of a culture.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>To a certain extent, there's an argument that deep background is unimportant for a game. Many of us play Traveller but it might as well be New Jersey. There's hardly anything in the culture that makes it different from today.</blockquote>\nIt depends on the game. Frankly, I think that's true of most sci-fi, games or not: the aliens are just humans with strange ears or wrinkled foreheads. The aliens in <em>Star Trek</em> have less cultural diversity across the alpha quadrant than you'll find just on Papua New Guinea. That works because those stories will, at best, make an occasional overture to dealing with a different way of life, but they don't dwell on it.<br/><br/>For something like <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em>, on the other hand, where the story is very much about how you live in a different context, things are somewhat different. So yes, definitely, whether or not this is something important depends on the type of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200032/#Comment_200032" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T18:29:14+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  6:29PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So Jason, have you thought about doing this backward?</p>\n<p>Specifically, starting from a set of social mores and customs that interest you, and working backward to create the history and the culture around it, thus that the final product is bigger and fuller than its origins, but it still has those things you were interested in to begin with?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200035/#Comment_200035" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T18:35:56+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  6:35PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I haven't thought about that--but it sounds like an interesting idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200039/#Comment_200039" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T20:11:36+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  8:11PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>The idea of phases in a lifepath, like you have in<em>Spirit of the Century</em>, could really work here, since there will be identifiable eras that each region will live through, and the question becomes, "How did event X impact your landscape?"</blockquote>\nThe concept of a lifepath for a civilization is worth this whole thread.

For any two characters, what is shared and what is different will emerge based on context ("Hey, another American here in Paris! And you're from Texas?

Define connections between cultural areas; at first, that may just be "geographically adjacent"<br/>3. Iteratively define an element for those areas: New York style pizza in NY, big belt buckles in TX, etc.<br/>4. Iteratively add connections between cultural areas--migration, mass media, whatever the case may be.<br/>5. Allow for the migration of elements along those lines of connection.<br/><br/>Then, you can have a PC who can choose so many cultural areas, and has access to the elements from those areas.

Any given technological development can change culture differently, which is how we all wind up different, but mostly its technology.  Religion is big too, but even the development of religion itself is dependent on technology so ultimately...I think its all tech.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the cultural change is profound from a small change in technology...say, the culture of the American west and south west after the introduction of barbed wire.  Barbed wire...a simple little thing really, completely changed the livestyle, livelyhood, and power structure of half the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think any sort of "culture Life Path" project would have to start in the way way back and postulate a small community of closely related individuals who just discovered the utility of the pointy stick.  And then move forward through time trying to ascertain how each development impacted the accreted mass of cultural traditions already established.  I think such an undertaking would be a fascinating exercise but really dang time consuming.

The birds make calls that make the same sound as a human speaking their language. For instance, in the evening, the hermit thrush says, "it is a fine evening." There's a cultural trait, and unless you classify "listening" or "repeating" as technological developments, there's no technology needed.<br><br>You've neatly summarized the Boasian view of how cultures changed, but I don't think that it explains much about cultures. It may well apply to some of the newer cultures that can trace their history to the Agricultural Revolution, but you have to remember that just because those cultures have had a tendency to conquer everything else doesn't make them any more representative of how cultures work as a whole. For the first 99% of all the time in which humans have developed cultures, you'd be hard-pressed to find any culture to back up that argument, and for most of that remaining 1%, 99% of the planet's cultures <em>still</em> defied that pattern. I mentioned Tainter in my last comment; his argument about the diminishing marginal returns on complexity fits the rise and fall of civilizations in history, and underlines the notion that technological development, like other forms of increasing complexity, is quite anomalous. When it does arise, it survives only briefly before crashing back down to a baseline.<br><br>If we look at the vast majority of human cultures\u2014cultures at that baseline\u2014we don't see much technological difference at all. In fact, what technologies they typically rely upon tend to have come so long ago in the past that we have a hard time knowing what order they appeared in. The differences in the cultures of Yupik, Yukaghirs and Ya\u0327nomam\xf6 have almost nothing to do with their differing technologies\u2014in fact, it's hard to find where their technologies differ at all. Rather, they differ in the ecology that they adapt to. Like the Koyukon, an example I picked for this very reason. Their language doesn't follow trends of technological development; it follows the patterns of life in that ecology.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200242/#Comment_200242" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T18:32:09+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  6:32PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait a second, Ralph. It's special pleading to say that all culture is technologically driven except for the parts that aren't. For the sake of argument, I'd be willing to go so far as to say that technology is driven by culture, rather than the other way around. For example, the Chinese invented movable type too, but only in the West (where cultural conditions were apt) did the invention produce revolutionary change, in the form of print. I've also read that the Japanese proscribed gunpowder weapons to preserve the cultural place of the samurai. You can say that differences in the reception of those technologies are conditioned by prior technological differences, but it seems easier to point to existing attitudes and beliefs as the proximate cause. Now, if you were to argue more broadly for the role of environment in shaping culture, I'd be right there with you. But I also think that there may be processes of cultural change, development, and articulation that are driven by an internal logic rather than being shaped by "external" forces.

Say there is a war and slavery is abolished but the two countries remain separate.

There's a place that's empty.<br/>2. People spontaneously pop into being.<br/>3. People begin interacting with their natural surroundings.<br/>4. Culture emerges from these interactions.<br/><br/>But that's clearly not the case.  People come to new places from somewhere else, bringing their cultural baggage with them, and then reinterpret that baggage in their interactions with a natural environment that's different from the one they left.  Like what Bill seems to suspect, I imagine that the cultural baggage people bring with them is as or more important than the material contexts of their new environment.<br/><br/>Also, people don't tend to live in little isolated clumps, with each clump representing a distinct culture.  Cultural boundaries are permeable, flexible, and impossible to define clearly.  They overlap all over the place.  And there are many other things going on in the cultural environment that aren't about people interacting with the natural world.  People also interact with other people, both people from cultural contexts closer to them and those from further away, who are more different.  And these interactions produce cultural developments and diversity just as surely as any interactions with the natural world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200336/#Comment_200336" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T06:28:18+00:00" title="April  3, 2009  6:28AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2009 6:28AM by shreyas.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Okay guys!</p>\n<p>I think we have all articulated our starting points effectively.

I merely list bioregionalism in general as a major influence for me. I also have other influences, especially the work of Tim Ingold, who has made some waves in anthropology over the past decade, and has really made me re-think some of my old ideas\u2014as you can probably tell just from how often I cite his arguments (usually one of the key indicators that someone hasn't fully digested an idea yet). But I find it really funny that you list those assumptions, given that so much of Ingold's work in particular comes from taking issue with <em>precisely</em> those assumptions.<br/><br/>If I understand you correctly, you want to push a "chicken &amp; the egg" problem one step back: people don't interact with the world around them without a thought in their heads. But of course, life existed before conscious thought\u2014conscious thought eventually emerged in evolution, and how can we describe evolution except as part of our ongoing engagement with the world? Ingold quite explicitly makes an argument in one essay breaking down our distinction between "evolution" on one hand, and "culture" or "history" on the other. They form one continuous process. At no point did a human stand up and say, "OK guys, we're done evolving; this is <em>culture</em> now" (unless you count Francis Fukuyama).<br/><br/>Think of tracks\u2014as traditional hunters almost always do. Once you've laid a track, it erodes, it becomes harder to see, but it never goes away. Other tracks lay over it,and it may eventually become so faint that no one can see it any more, but it never went away. I mentioned the ancient origins of the modern highway system upthread. Mammoth migration trails became human migration trails, which became trade routes, which became highways\u2014not because we suddenly created them from whole-cloth, but because we kept going over the same paths in different ways.<br/><br/>So, what do I mean by all of this with regards to culture? This <em>only</em> works if you have a filled space to interact with, if people emerge by a continual process of being-in-the-world (as traditional evolution would describe one part of) rather than popping into being. Yes, people would come into new places with their own experiences and patterns, but because those patterns exist in the relationship between the people and their surroundings rather than inside their heads, when they change their surroundings, their experiences and patterns change as well.<br/><br/>Compare the view in which humans only interact with the world through their culture, where we understand "culture" as something that exists entirely in the human brain. First, a human must have culture to interact with the world. But where do they get culture from, if they can't interact with the world? Language? But then, where does language come from? Without interacting with the world, we have no shared understandings, so even if I can develop a fully functional language myself, I have no way of communicating it to you. Ingold comes at this from slightly different directions enough times to fill a book (literally), but I think that offers a sufficient summary for us. You must interact with the world in order to form culture, so we can't interact with the world <em>through</em> culture. So culture can't exist entirely in our brains; it has to exist in our relationships with the world. So, if our relationships with the world change\u2014as they do if we move from this river valley to the next one\u2014then our culture changes, too. Like the old tracks that fade away, they don't disappear, they just become increasingly irrelevant as they fade into obscurity. The relationships with the new world we inhabit come to the foreground. The unique history of people becomes less and less important the more native they become, as the culture native to the land itself expresses itself more and more. In native traditions, people generally talk about their stories, customs, traditions, etc. coming from the land, other-than-human creatures sharing the same stories, customs, traditions, etc. that they also got from the land, and things like "imagination" and "culture" existing not in their minds, but in an ecological relationship. For an excellent example of this, see Joe Sheridan &amp; Roronhiakewen "He Clears the Sky" Dan Longboat, "<a href="http://sac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/4/365" rel="nofollow">The Haudenosaunee Imagination and the Ecology of the Sacred</a>."<br/><br/>This also addresses your point about cultural diffusion, albeit more indirectly. For one thing, until the Neolithic Revolution (that is, the most recent sliver of human history), people generally <em>did</em> live in "isolated clumps," and throughout most of the time since, continued to in most places. But regardless, as this view makes clear, I think, you can't separate humans from our environment. Interacting with the world around you doesn't just mean trees and rocks, but the people there, too\u2014human people or other-than-human people. Just as the Koyukon learned their language from bird persons, they would quite happily also learn new building techniques from human persons. But trying to use the same building techniques used in the Pacific Northwest would not work in Koyukon territory, so once again, the interactions with the local environment assert themselves. And moreover, the people from the Pacific Northwest trying to share their building techniques themselves developed those ideas from interacting with the materials and conditions of <em>their</em> territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200573/#Comment_200573" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T07:40:10+00:00" title="April  4, 2009  7:40AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas,<br/><br/>This probably only works for my game, but that's the context I've been thinking about. Because of the strongly place-centered attitude of the game, I define places with themes. A geographical location in the landscape has a theme; or, you could say that a theme has a geographical location. A character comes <em>from</em> a particular place, has a bond to a specific geographical location\u2014a home, a sit-spot, etc. I read a biology author once describe animals as a bit of soil ecology that wraps itself up in a skin to go for a walk; besides offering a fairly concise summation of animal biology, it also reminded me of myths like the creation of Adam, the Hebrew word <em>Adama</em> for "earth," or the relationship between the words "human" and "humus." But in game terms, it means you share the theme anchored to your place.<br/><br/>I've spent some time working on <a href="http://thefifthworldsg.blogspot.com/2009/03/narrative-game-economy-of-making-you.html" rel="nofollow">a narrative economy</a> for my game, and I tie the cultural elements into that. The elements exist in the territory, in the places associated with places and in the paths/relationships that connect them. When you hit on the themes associated with a place\u2014whether that means performing a traditional practice there, or a ritual, etc.\u2014you can get the rewards associated with that place.<br/><br/>How might you use this in a game not quite so intensely bioregional? Well, I think you'd showcase cultural elements in terms of place, rather than in terms of characters. So, reinforce praying in a church and cheering in a stadium. Define characters in terms of where they feel most at home, so a priest may bring a predilection for prayer with him wherever he goes, and a sports fan may bring a predilection for cheering with him wherever he goes.<br/><br/>So, you might create a culture with iterative rounds of creating and diffusing elements, and define those elements with particular contexts. You wouldn't need to confine yourself to specific locations as contexts, either; you could define contexts in time or situation, as well. And you would then define characters, at least in part, in terms of where they feel at home. So another character might feel at home at classy dinner parties. Classy dinner party might have elements associated with it like, influence brokering. So our aforementioned character might always have a penchant for influence brokering, even when not at a classy dinner party.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
