I have only run games around a table and never ventured online.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've set up a PbP RP with a few friends and we're trying to make a serious attempt at literature with it. Its free form writing and most of the writing is organized ahead of time with the GM before it is posted.  All the players know the general direction of the game and a rough outline of what needs to happen, but they get to fill in the gaps and prove their merit as a writer.  We hope to compile it into some kind of written document eventually and see if it can be published, but that may be a pipe dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the logistics of setting up a board and figuring out how the play will happen has proven the death knell of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginally we had a separate folder for the different locations and then each person posted in them as they traveled from location to location.  This got confusing very quickly because the readers couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t follow the progress of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we broke it into folders according to story arc, and each character participating in each story arc posted there.  We then ran into the problem of chronological ordering.  It is very difficult to organize into chronological order posts after the fact on a traditional message board without reposting everything and deleting the old posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is:  How can I set up a site that can be modified/ added too only by a few people but accessed by all of my readers who can easily see and read updates.  In addition, it needs to facilitate the multiple perspectives of the different characters into a cohesive document.   Furthermore, I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know if this is an issue or not, but copyright infringement might become an issue with people stealing our story and claiming as their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would like to keep the \xe2\u20ac\u0153feel\xe2\u20ac\x9d of a message board, because a lot of the writing has been done in the format of posts.  So the document will be read as posts and not one continuous text.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, it must be free, because I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m a cheap bastard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for the advice, and if you need more info in order to help, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be glad to provide it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70000/#Comment_70000" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T09:33:26+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  9:33AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, although it breaks your goal of keeping the 'feel' of a message board... I think that working through a 'wiki' is probably the best way of doing things. My own wiki-fu is pretty weak, but, if you are interested, someone on the board will probably be able to produce a good free source for it.<br/><br/>Another good option would be to do something with a blog (for instance, Wordpress has free blogs). This has the advantage of maintaining something of a 'post' format, being completely free, and only allowing certain people to edit. You can also create seperate 'pages' so that the running blog would be a series of posts but then there would also be a centralized place where it was all ordered correctly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70006/#Comment_70006" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T09:51:58+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  9:51AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2007 9:52AM by Adam_Dray.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Crossposted!</i><br/><br/>I recently set up <a href="http://foundry.legendary.org/" rel="nofollow">FoundryWiki</a>. It's empty. It's available for use by gamer types who hang around on Foundry MUSH. <br/><br/>Even if you have no urge to hang around on Foundry MUSH, you could use a wiki for what you're doing. Mediawiki allows a "closed editorial team" policy with a simple configuration change. That means that anyone can read the wiki, only people with login accounts can edit the wiki, and a moderator has to create accounts for people. <br/><br/>Wiki would probably be perfect for your needs because of its inherent hyperlinking capability. Whenever you want to create a link from a word or phrase to some other page, you just [[surround it in brackets]] and it becomes a link. Pretty easy.<br/><br/>You can sorta mock up the "message board" feel by linking pages with "next" and "previous" links or by dividing a single page into "posts" by putting a bar between them and signing each one with the author's name and the date/time (Mediawiki does this for you when you type "~~~~" in a page).<br/><br/>If you want it for free, stop by Foundry MUSH and say hi. I will set up a separate wiki <i>just for you</i> if you don't want to use FoundryWiki.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70014/#Comment_70014" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T10:09:24+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 10:09AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, my first response is a wiki, as well.<br/><br/>Alternately, <a href="http://drupal.org" rel="nofollow">Drupal</a> might serve you well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/outsider" title="outsider"><img alt="outsider" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/outsider">outsider</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70070/#Comment_70070" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T13:29:25+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  1:29PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the help guys.

In general, asking for legal advice on a forum is not the best plan in the world.

One of the nice things about wiki is that it archives everything, so if there ever were a contest, you'd have ample documentation of when you wrote what.  On the whole, though, I don't think you would be at high risk for someone running off with your work for a quick buck -- it wouldn't be quick at all.  Transforming wiki pages into a manuscript into laidout pages would be a significant investment of time -- a barrier that I doubt many opportunists would bother overcoming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70073/#Comment_70073" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T13:49:40+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  1:49PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey outsider--<br/><br/>You may want to consider using tagging to keep your stuff organized.  Sites like Flickr and YouTube get huge benefits from tagging, because it's a super-dynamic way of organizing information.  You don't have to define your organizational method up front (like you did with your locations and story arc folders) and then be stuck with it; your filing system can adapt to whatever new information you throw at it.<br/><br/>For example, posts could be tagged with a combination of character names, locations, author names, story arc title, date within the continuity, whatever you can think of.  Then, it becomes very simple to find all posts about character Y or location Z or day X.  And the burden on your participants is very low.  Tagging is awesome.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what technologies you'd be able to use for this.  I know Livejournal does this, but many people hate LJ.  Other blog systems, I don't know about.  Hey wiki-people, can you tag wiki nodes nowadays?  (I'm not a wiki guru, so maybe the task of organizing a wiki's gotten easier.  I've worked for tech companies that did their documentation primarily on wikis, and those were a hideous mess that required elaborate manually-kept indices...<br/><br/>Anyway, good luck outsider!
