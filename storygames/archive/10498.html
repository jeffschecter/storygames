Having an authentication issue for what I assume to be about 12 hours or so. Will work on it today. Basically, if you sign out and sign back in, or if you just simply sign in from a new PC, you will be affected by this issue.<br/><br/><b>FIXED!

DO THIS!</b><br/><br/><b>1) Go to the login screen, and do the dance where you say "I forgot my password". It asks you for your username. It will send you an email to the email account that you have in your user profile.<br/>2) Use this email to set up a new (or the same) password.<br/>3) Use that password to log in.</b><br/><br/>Looks simple enough, but you're thinking, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>But I didn't change my password? I'm positive I know what it is!</i></span>" If you can't log in, <b>do the above anyway</b>. You need to to basically reset a random character password hash that will work for you, which gets appended on the database back-end for your account.<br/><br/><b>WHAT HAPPENED?</b><br/><br/>Long story short, I upgraded the Vanilla forums last night from a much older version (1.1.4) to the latest version (1.1.9) to see if this might fix that weird post-out-of-order issue we see every now and then (hey, BTW, if that issue still happens let me know).<br/><br/>The old password hash size on the database used to be 32 characters max. The new version of Vanilla will create hashes that are <b>33</b>-characters long. So, if your password is "abc", it creates a 33-character long string of garbage (so that I/forum admin/etc can't sneak into the database and see what kinds of passwords you all use). See the problem yet? The last character (after the first 32) was getting dropped, and no one could log in once they switched computers or logged off.<br/><br/>For folks who were using the same PC as last night, and their sessions were saved (cookies) they didn't notice anything, because they didn't have to log in again, thus the password hash never changed. But folks who switched PCs (work vs home), logged out etc in the last 24 hours got hit by this issue. There weren't that many of us, but the behavior was really confusing.<br/><br/>Anyway, I opened that field on the database to 40 characters, so we won't have any more problems. However, for those of you hit by this issue, you'll have to do that stuff above to reset the hash and get in.<br/><br/><b>FORGOT YOUR USER NAME? PLEASE EMAIL ME, DO NOT CREATE A NEW MEMBER ACCOUNT!<br/></b><br/>Email me at <b>storygames</b> atmark <b>gmail</b> dot <b>com</b> and we'll figure it out together. I want to try to keep as many bogus/duplicate entries out of the database as possible. Plus, it'll be easier for you to track your posting history and all.<br/><br/>IF YOU WORK WITH DATABASES/PHP FOR A LIVING, and were morbidly curious as to what all happened, here was my support thread over on Vanilla. Unfortunately, their community forum search engine was broken, but I was able to Google what I needed, which appears in the last post on that thread. For those of you who work in deep-level storage server support, notice my clearly defined issue and self-made support informational template? Yeah, go me.
