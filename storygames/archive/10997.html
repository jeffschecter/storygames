The fundamental mechanic of the game is a <i>real-time pacing</i> mechanism. The "if you roll a 6, you say what happens, and otherwise the GM does" is not much of a mechanic because that's not the game. The game is chasing resources as the threat visibly ratchets higher and higher.

I feel that 3:16 is a game of screwing over your friends.  In my games, players are desperate to make sure they're in the right 'range' in order to get more kills than their friends, as kills garner upgrades.  It seems 3:16 is mechanised (using the nomination for demotion mechanic and the versus kills mechanic) to tell stories where troopers compete.  I haven't played Shotgun Diaries.

As with other zombie productions, the real danger is not necessarily just the zombies, it's that people will start looking out for themselves rather than the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244152/#Comment_244152" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T15:23:08+00:00" title="November 29, 2009  3:23PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I brought this up because I think the system underlying both games has a lot of applications outside of their nominal subjects.<br/><br/>The next step would be to come up with a generic version of the system that would make it easier for people to understand how the parts work together and how they could adapt it to other genres.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244168/#Comment_244168" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T18:10:40+00:00" title="November 29, 2009  6:10PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I own 3:16 and I wrote SGD.

Really, the zombie clock is the star of this game and is the best real time mechanic I've ever seen in an RPG. It's got a long enough timer (and is easily customizable) that if you have some slower, more thoughtful (or shy) players, they can still get meaningful planning and action in, yet it's fast enough that in a typical session it can get very intimidating.

You can't rely on  "and here some Narration happens," a cool concept, moody artwork, authorial "intent," or a gimmick like a Jenga Tower to solve basic game design issues.<br/><br/>That is also why identifying underlying structures would be a very productive exercise for a community like this. It would help a lot of designers avoid making those same missteps all over again.<br/><br/>The reason why people have a hard time seeing the structure underlying 3:16 is because it is so well integrated with the theme <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in its presentation</span> - but the structure itself doesn't have anything to do with that theme. You could literally turn it into a military style zombie game just by changing the word "alien" to "zombie" and making the settings different locations in or around a large city. And it would be very easy to change into a survivor zombie game with only a little renaming and tweaking of some of the structures.<br/><br/>SGD would be better if a couple of gaps in the system were filled in. Fear should be tied to failing at a Risk - which would also eliminate the really bad game effect of having the gm kill you merely for a bad die roll (something no one likes, but designers always want to do for some reason - like they are all frustrated gms). And there needs to be an explicit mechanism for dispatching zombie "threats" - the same way 3:16 has a means for dealing with alien threats (including a kill mechanism even though the actual numbers are irrelevant).

I think in a survival horror game where there's literally one decision to make in character creation, killing a character for a bad die roll is juuuust fine.  I just think there ought to be more ways to increase Fear is all. <br/><br/>There is a way to dispatch zombie threats in SGD, I'm confused.  It's the whole die rolling system. Are you saying that more zombie situations should be considered threats? I'm not sure that I agree. The game is based on the zombie clock/supply system.  The survivors have to take risks to find sanctuary and obtain supplies. While doing so, zombies are a threat based on the Fear level (which may cause survivors to cut off their friends from their support) and . If they have sanctuary and supplies there is no real threat from zombies until enough time passes that the zombie threat is just overwhelming or the supplies run low. This is true in the source material too. What method would you prefer for identifying zombie threats?<br/><br/>The game could have used another editing pass, though. As an example, the game refers to "Survivor type" as if it was numeric. It's not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244360/#Comment_244360" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T08:43:09+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  8:43AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my part, I though the system was (mainly) about competition for selecting range to earn more kills to emphasis silly (but at the same time fun) competition. <br/> <br/>I don't know for tying fear with risk failing, usually risk failing in story game is fun, you often enjoy failing.

That's the definition of roleplaying - identifying with a character who has different qualities than you do (whether positive or negative).<br/><br/>2. Yes. And it's exactly what Storytelling games are designed to avoid. The whole purpose of a storytelling game is to make actions and effects meaningful from the standpoint of the story - not due to the arbitrary results of a game system. Of course, even with a traditional rpg, a good gm doesn't let die rolls control the story - but it's always awkward when the gm has to overrule the system to save the story.<br/><br/>3. And while Yahtzee does have strategy in one sense of the word, it only consists of managing statistical possibilities. Any action you take can always be trumped by the dice - which again means you have no ultimate control. The dice drive what you do - not the other way around. While Backgammon is similar, it adds two very important dimensions to the game through the interaction of the player's positions and the use of the doubling cube. It's not a game merely of statistics, but of variously aggressive or defensive strategies along with informed risk taking - where you are fundamentally playing against the other player's level and judgment of risk tolerance, and not just the dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244707/#Comment_244707" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T16:20:47+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  4:20PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2009 4:25PM by John_Harper.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Number6intheVillage</cite>And I have never met a single PLAYER who was happy about a character dying because of a die roll.</blockquote>\nHi, I'm John Harper.

FF is making thematic decisions with his character as a result of him knowing the system, and he wants a system that will give him the opportunity to make those choices.  As an example, the timing of my search for new supplies/sanctuary and who I go with and what style of character I have in Shotgun Diaries all effect the risk that my character is taking in the game system. I make those decisions advocating for what my character would do, true to the theme. <br/><br/>I really don't get what you're on about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245471/#Comment_245471" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T06:22:48+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  6:22AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Number6intheVillage</cite>So we waste more time because people can't tell the difference between game system and theme and don't understand the difference between RPGs and Storytelling games.</blockquote>\nNo. We waste more time because you're too busy being snarky and making unsubstantiated claims to explain yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265138/#Comment_265138" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T09:52:27+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  9:52AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I'm on about is that you're both on the wrong board.
