The first three forum topics appearing right now don't have any "plugged" RPGs. (If I count this one; I suppose I could omit it - that still leaves two.)<br/><br/>Is that worth 30$ (or at least 20$)? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The next topic down has one (1) mention of a game, but, in my opinion, it's helpful - it's not a plug for the game, but a discussion of a technique in that game which is relevant to the topic. The person who started threat seems to have been very glad it was mentioned.<br/><br/>The next topic after <i>that</i> does include a few links to games (because they are being discussed), but none seem to be being "plugged" (and only one is linked to by a person involved with the creation of that game). I can see you discounting this one, I suppose, but that would require a pretty powerful reinterpretation of the term "plugged".<br/><br/>Further down, I see lots more threads which aren't about and don't include plugs for games (like every one of my recent topics, as well as every thread on the front page started by Ry).<br/><br/>More importantly, though:<br/><br/>This is a forum with the stated purpose of discussing and creating games. How would that work, exactly, if no one mentioned games or linked to them?<br/><br/>I probably wouldn't find out about new games if I didn't come here and find links to them. I like learning about new games!<br/><br/>I DO see a lot of games being mentioned and plugged, yes, but so many of the topics we currently have active on the forum are, "Hey guys, what game would you use to do this?" Is it wrong for someone to mention a game (or even, gasp, their own game) if that is precisely what is being asked for?<br/><br/>I agree that perhaps we could use more content that's not specific to certain games. But that's on me and you and everyone: go ahead and start a topic that's not about that.

I do follow links to games showcased here a lot too and I'm actually grateful for that, since it often made me discover either a great game, some nice mechanics or at least a good example of how I should never do things (including self promotion)<br/><br/>For me the great difference between... -ok, let's call it "good plugging" and "bad plugging" to be honest, cause it's still plugging- is that the bad one is just derailing the discussion, links me to something I have to pay for to find out what it is (I'd certainly prefer to find a review on that link instead of the site selling it and no further info about it), and/or the person posting it imposes her/his solution as the best thing ever.<br/><br/>Also, "good plugging" is for me a way to say "my best answer for what you're asking for includes a lot of things in this game that showcase my entire design philosophy. Instead of explaining it here (cuz I'm too lazy for it, you would be bored to death and it will derail the thread) you can read it and experience it on your own, here"<br/><br/>Anyway, it's not the first time we have discussed about this and though it has certainly made a lot of people over-conscientious about the subject (I was about to leave the forum when I saw this subject pressed on the last time), if it ticks anyone so much, how about we establish a code like the "Slow down" thing? In this case, the OP would have the option to ask "No game-plugging answers" on the thread, either at the start or later. Now, leaving it to the OP's choice doesn't mean nobody could ask for this if they feel there's too much plugging in the thread. One thing I love about SG is that here, signalling us that you're getting annoyed by something usually stops us from doing so, while imposing things (even when you're right) feeds the trolls and gets threads closed in no time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450548/#Comment_450548" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-11T16:14:12+00:00" title="January 11, 2016  4:14PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2016 4:23PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I think a simple "avoid plugging games in this thread, please" would do 99% of the job, if a poster feels her thread might invited unwanted "plugging".

It is a game we are playing <i>right now</i> -- not three months from now, not "someday," but actually, honest-to-god currently playing as our weekly game. No more buying games because they "look interesting." My poor overloaded bookshelves have spoken, there is no more room for unplayed games.<br/><br/>2. It is a game that has a sizable chunk of information in it (rules, etc.) that would be useful for me to have outside our weekly game session. If it's a rules-light game, I don't need a copy of my own.<br/><br/>3. I can get it cheap. I know all the best used bookstores, and I'll shop there first. I've got my own ideas about what a game book would be worth to me, and if I can't pay that price (or lower), eh, I'll just do without.

If you want to mention your Tarantino game in a Tarantino thread, the question isn't "whether", merely "how".<br/><br/>I'm happy to hear as many words about your game as are relevant to the conversation it's introduced in.  (And on that note, I'd recommend being forthcoming.  I think it's pretty much proven that indie publishers make more sales by putting out free stuff than they lose, by miles and miles.  If you don't want to describe your core mechanic or whatever, then that's your right, and you won't be the only one, but it's not necessary to keep secrets to sell books.)<br/><br/>I don't think any of us have any idea how many people buy games that are mentioned or linked here.

And then they happen to measure that distance in miles instead... XD but you do make me feel included as well as a lot of other people here, thank you all.<br/><br/>So, I'm a minority, Nathan is probably a minority and minority's rights often get the respect they deserve here in SG.
