However, as a reader, I also wish some books had more closing paragraphs where, after all those details are laid out, more broad sweeping statements are made that tie it all together. Without these, I have to find these helpful generalizations either through play or by reading the book several times. <br/><br/>For example, Fate games like SotC or Dresden Files seem more complex than they really are because of this. I'm currently reading Night's Black Agents and, amongst a wealth of endless options and bits of instructions mixed with setting flavor, I wish this exposition would stop sometimes and just try to wrap all those little mechanics in a couple of paragraphs or with just some kind of doodle. <br/><br/>Say stuff like "Notice how in all of A, it's either B or C." or "The only time you have to worry about X, is when Y or Z happens." I'm sure you already do this when you teach the game at a playtest session or demo. Share some of that system mastery that you surely have.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420543/#Comment_420543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T06:19:20+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  6:19AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Better yet, actual examples of play, i.e. where a hypothetical player party finds itself in Y or Z type of scene, so readers can see how X is worried about in practice.

There are many other things about the game that could be described this way, leaving the text blocks for stating other options and special cases for every procedure. I'd love if there could be one for AW, I still can't grasp thinking on "something awful or a hard choice" when the games states so...  for some reason I feel like I'm trying to GM with someone pointing a gun at my head when I read that. Well, perhaps it's more an issue of my own, but if I could see how is everything done in the game, I'd feel more relaxed about running it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420545/#Comment_420545" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T07:17:11+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  7:17AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's just say you won't have to wait too much longer for an AW engine game using comics to explain techniques and examples of play *not-so-secret secrets*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420547/#Comment_420547" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T07:36:45+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  7:36AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Better yet, actual examples of play, i.e. where a hypothetical player party finds itself in Y or Z type of scene, so readers can see how X is worried about in practice.

It hearkens back to computer programming. When you build a computer program, there are two ways to do it (although to be frank...most programs hybrid the two of them, although some just use the first one).<br/><br/><b>Procedural:</b> This is laid out like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. "You can do A or B. If you do A, jump to Line 214. If you do B, jump to line 53." It's very long and cumbersome when you're making a complex program, and it tends to get tangled above a certain level of complexity. On the flip side, it's concrete and specific; you can see exactly what's going on, and you can tell the flow of the program just by reading through it.<br/><br/>An RPG procedure is something like "these are the steps of combat" or "this is how you create a character". The more linear it is, the easier it is to understand, so long as the line doesn't get too tangled or jumbled.<br/><br/><b>Object-Oriented:</b> This is more like a sandbox. You show up, and decide which parts to interact with. These parts have rules that help them to decide what happens when they interact with one another, and you can use the parts in any order. You can pick them up and put them down whenever you feel like it. This makes it elegant for complex programs, because you can treat different parts of the system as discrete elements, instead of stops along the way. It's also efficient; in a procedural program, you might have to loop through a particular section of code multiple times, or else put multiple copies of it down. In an object-oriented program, you make one copy of it, and tell the computer to use that copy whenever it's needed. (I hope that all made sense.)<br/><br/>Object-oriented design in an RPG is pretty ubiquitous. A great example is Apocalypse World's moves; each one is a module that tells you what happens when you "pick it up" to use it; it also gives restrictions on <i>when</i> you can pick it up.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as you might guess, it's harder to read a bunch of modules and figure out what the whole looks like. This is partially because the whole is also created by player input. But you can get a good idea of what it'll look like, if you're able to visualize it well. But that's a very specific skill.<br/><br/><b>In Conclusion!</b><br/><br/>In general, the best way to make a game easier to play is to add more (optional) procedural elements! It helps the players focus on something concrete, and that lets you say "here's the modules that let us get to that; see how they interact in play!", which gives a significant advantage to anyone attempting to visualize how the modules all fit together.<br/><br/>TBZ's explanation manga get a lot of attention, but equally important is their diagram of the aiki-kiai-karma cycle. That's a great way to help players "get it", by showing them how the bits of the system interact and work in a concrete way.<br/><br/>Even if your game is abstract as all get-out (which can be a very strong design indeed), include something concrete! Not everyone is able to visualize at the drop of a hat. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420557/#Comment_420557" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T08:33:03+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  8:33AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, I forgot abouth the infographics!

Everything else in the game comes second: lists of abilities, traits, skills, races, classes, equipment, backgrounds, etc. Of course, things like Moves make this easier since they encompass many things at once (they are at the same time procedures, rules, options, color and perfectly illustrate the principles)<br/><br/>I can't wait for that AW engine, kksimons, I definitely need it now!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
