He's really really improved.<br/><br/><br/>-----------<br/><br/><br/>Improved?<br/><br/>I am challenged by this statement, regarding podcasts (or presentations in general) that represent a professional for his company.<br/><br/><br/>I will always give folks the benefit of doubt on playing in the spotlight like this. I'm sure that if games that I've been a part of (as DM or player) were recorded in any manner - that I (and other's watching/listening) would see mistakes or questionable play style.<br/>Frankly... that's the stuff that groups (usually) don't recall when thinking of the games past. The tiny mistakes are almost not noticeable during or post-game (unless they're sticking points that get discussed actively during game). And generally if (my groups) see or remember a mistake in rules or other-wise play, we generally say "okay, let's correct that for next time..." no harm, no foul. We all still had fun!<br/><br/><br/>That said...<br/><br/>I do have a hard time and question WotC's choices when listening to or watching any EMPLOYEE of the company, a creator of the game that's willing to put themselves "out there" and see the DM make:<br/><br/>- questionable DMing decisions (rules over fun/creativity??)<br/>- rule mistakes that are in many cases (somewhat) remedial<br/>- not aiding their players unfamiliar with the rules<br/>- a lower level of what makes table-top, in-person RPGs fun (ie. over-the-top and excellent ROLE-PLAYING)<br/><br/>As a player.<br/>As a Dungeon Master.<br/>As a storyteller and general loving member of the community for this hobby.<br/>And PRIMARILY as a doctorate level marketing professional...<br/><br/>I am challenged with the DM "entertainers" and the DMing choices they have made during games that WotC has "presented" to the public for the MARKETING of the game itself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though the podcasts (video or audio) have generally been fun...<br/>I really am challenged to understand the marketing strategy here. Say what we may, WotC is a business. RPGs have come out of obscurity and become a full-fledged entertainment form. Some would say an art. Table-top RPGs are social, fun, interactive, and have even become ground breakingly trend setting... (spawning WoW and many other forms of entertainments)<br/><br/><br/>I say this...<br/>I question with pure love of the hobby and a sincere want for our SHARED hobby to survive and thrive. I question from my marketing education and experience that is tempered with a history of hobby fun gaming. I question from my love of the style of play and the more advanced marketing of the "new" D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I have wholly enjoyed the directions WotC has taken in their promotions and marketing schemes from advertising to events to art direction. I've enjoyed it SO MUCH that I invested one of my marketing master's semester presentations on a researched critique of the D&amp;D4 marketing mix...<br/><br/>In my hobby game industry experience and my general career work with art direction and marketing, I have a difficult time believing that I am unique or a rarity amid the RPG hobbiest and professional community - with this equal level of care, interest and education.<br/>I could understand if many of the marketing team at WotC are not as experienced or interested in understanding the hobby. I wouldn't be surprised if those employees haven't actively played the game. That's not uncommon (in my industry experience) to have employees that aren't "fan-boys". In fact, sometimes that's a benefit.<br/><br/>However... my point is, I am challenged in enjoying the choices made, the lack of preparation, etc... that is presented to the hobby demographic to entice new players into the FUN of the game or in a more likely circumstance - to entice gamers that have not (will not) tried D&amp;D4. (SIDEBAR: I would guess that those podcasts are targeted *more* toward gamers as opposed to non-gamers)<br/>OR, perhaps it is honestly a LACK of attention by the marketing representatives at WotC regarding these (marketing) vehicles? But - I find it hard to believe that a marketing professional who is planning the strategy of D&amp;D4's promotional planning has "missed" this obvious opportunity (ie. actual play of the game!).<br/><br/><br/>And let me be clear...<br/>By lack of preparation - I am not talking about the DM being completely unprepared.<br/><br/>What I am talking about is that it would seem a Marketing Director looking to utilize these avenues to open up the hobby would discuss, if not REQUIRE, certain aptitude for DMing techniques, role-playing style, rule interpretation and a general entertainment value when planning as THE "DUNGEON MASTER" before setting down to the table.<br/><br/><br/>It pains me that a creator of the game botches a rule and be generally "unfamiliar" with many simple rules. Simple rules. (why not, at the very least, pay some rule-lawyer gamer, intern wage to sit in the background and help with rules??)<br/><br/>It confounds me that this "DM position" isn't one that's been thought of to be an "educational" tool for other new players and DMs. As noted above, everyone will make mistakes. Web-critics will always find problems. But being a caring teacher of the rules, helping NEW players at the table in front of these podcasts would seem to be a smart priority. Rather than just DMing without interest in an "old-school" style DM vs. Players "let then fend for their own" way...<br/><br/>It aggravates me to watch a new player get his very creative idea (the ice melting door) squashed due to the letter of the rule, not the spirit - when clearly after referencing the rules the letter was ALSO interpreted incorrectly - if a power targets a "creature" inherently it MUST be able to target an "object" as well (as per targeting/breaking held item rules).<br/><br/><br/><br/>To conclude my opening thought...<br/>I say again - I sympathize with and have been impressed with the DMs that have stepped up knowing the many back-seat, arm-chair web-critics that will tear them down.<br/>I am NOT looking to do that.<br/>I very much appreciate the efforts being given and have enjoyed and respected many of the marketing and creative directions that WotC has brought the world with D&amp;D in the last decade.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What I'm asking is for discussion on how or why some of this "lack" of thought has been taken in things that seem remedial from a marketer's point of view. And frankly, nearly insulting as a hobby community enthusiast.<br/><br/>I understand if the decisions for marketing haven't been approached yet.<br/>But I find some of these points painfully unacceptable as a professional and as a hobbiest hoping our hobby survives and thrives in the future.<br/><br/><br/>WotC has a large responsibility as the owners of D&amp;D. So goes the original RPG, so goes our hobby. I, personally, would LOVE to be in the position to add to THIS portion of the growth of the game. As a fan, as a gamer looking to grow our hobby, as a marketing professional - I would love help the team dedicated to this growth.<br/><br/>I question because of my passion.<br/><br/><br/>What do you think game community?<br/>-kev-<br/><br/>kevin perrine<br/>Seattle, WA                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257230/#Comment_257230" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-19T21:34:37+00:00" title="February 19, 2010  9:34PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no idea what you're talking about, was there some recorded play that WotC put out that had some problem with it or...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257234/#Comment_257234" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-19T22:26:04+00:00" title="February 19, 2010 10:26PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I have no idea what you're talking about, was there some recorded play that WotC put out that had some problem with it or...?</blockquote>\napologies - thought I quoted the link<br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-user?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=user"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/user/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>WotC has published 9 (so for) segments of a D&amp;D4 game on Video Podcast, DMed by their Creative Director for D&amp;D4, played by some of the creators of the TV show Robot Chicken.<br/><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257238/#Comment_257238" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-19T22:40:30+00:00" title="February 19, 2010 10:40PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And your issue is that you didn't feel the advertisement was slick enough or practiced enough?

WotC's general advertising and their marketing and art direction style is good if not great... Using all of the precision style gained from marketing the machines of Pokemon, Magic, etc...<br/><br/>"Slick" or "Practiced" as an example of advertisement isn't my concern.  The execution of the experience is what I question.<br/><br/>THIS opportunity - to show "actual play" of just WHY and HOW a table-top RPG (the most famous being D&amp;D) can be great fun, promotes a real social dynamic learning capacity and many other benefits that kids (and not so young kids) can enjoy and at the same time grow from - this compared to the isolated mechanics of World of Warcraft and that variety of game/hobby/experience.<br/>The opportunity, in my opinion, could be better done.  Or at least better thought through from the WotC side of the DM screen, as to the goal and execution at the heart of the role-play session and DMing example.<br/><br/>The mistakes you can see range from simple rule knowledge (or lack thereof) for the product,  to lack of teaching or aiding new players with the rules,  to lackluster role-play encouragement and enthusiasm,  all the way to a new "staple" of more modern RPGs (including advice from the DMG)  that suggests you reward player creativity rather than ignore or squash it  (why couldn't a "fire" descriptive power melt ice on a door?).<br/><br/><br/><br/>But hey, you shudder... I consider, critique and enjoy advertising well done  or consider how to improve lackluster schemes.  <br/>Advertising (to me) is a very interesting study in human psychology.  We each "market" in a vast array of ways daily.  Marketing ourselves,  our lifestyles,  our family,  our hobbies,  our work,  etc...  Advertising and marketing have become so ingrained in modern culture that many times it DOES become annoying or invisible or in best application seemless with our decision making.<br/>THIS "marketing" is a lack of attention, in my opinion.  And That's something I really wish better of, so that our hobby can survive if not thrive in the future...<br/><br/>-kevin-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257275/#Comment_257275" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-20T09:05:51+00:00" title="February 20, 2010  9:05AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All marketing is dirty lies, deceptive, horrific.
