Vs. the environment, you roll vs. a stable difficulty.<br/>2. Vs. an opponent, you both roll and see who gets higher.<br/><br/>Most games that I can think of work like that. One exception was one draft of a game that got posted on the rpg.net game dev forum a while back. Was a fairly standard but elegant and clever Indian mythology-inspired Sword and Sorcery game. In that game all task resolution rolls were done by rolling a dice pool equal to the character's skill vs. a dice pool equal to the task's difficulty and see who gets higher. This meant that the same mechanics were used for task and conflict resolution, which I think is kind of cool.<br/><br/>Any other games do this? I've been having some thoughts about how to take this idea and turn it up to 11. Seems like a cool way of putting an extra tool into the GM's hand especially since all of the mechanics that people use when doing conflict resolution would then be available to the GM when rolling for the environment side for task resolution. <br/><br/>Silly example<br/><br/>Player: I'm going to jump over the fence.<br/>GM: OK your jump skill is three and the difficulty of jumping over the fence is three. Let's both roll three dice and see who gets higher.<br/>Player: Right.<br/>GM: Using the called shot rules I'll give up on one my three dice but if you fail the called shot means that you get a fencepost in your groin.<br/>Player: Ouch.<br/><br/>Also could be used for GMs to set up "you succeed, but...." situations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113953/#Comment_113953" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T21:33:39+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  9:33PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HeroQuest uses opposed rolls for everything, as I recall. <br/><br/>I note also that this usage of task/conflict resolution is not one I have seen before, and may confuse people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113980/#Comment_113980" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T03:05:53+00:00" title="December 13, 2007  3:05AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used a two-sided wager mechanic to do Raising the Stakes (i.e. adding stakes to any d20 task-based resolution).

(That's the term you're looking for. Conflict and task resolution are completely unrelated to rolling dice. (They seem to be unrelated to anything, in such way, that no one can define them properly. Which means that those are rather useless terms, but that's not the the matter here.))<br/><br/>Such games would be, for example: Donjon, Dogs in the Vineyard, AGON                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
