All of your advantages, all the feats, all the bonuses that feats give you, all the bonuses that your stats give you, all the bonuses that your skills give you, your level, everything; everything is frontloaded.  You do everything before you roll the d20.  There are no choices to make after the dice are rolled.  You roll the dice; the dice tell you what happens.  And what I wanted to do was I wanted to create a system that was the exact opposite of that.  I wanted to create a system where after the dice rolled, everything happened.<br/><br/>So, what happened was is that in <i>Houses</i> we have a standard target number which is 10; 10 is always the target number, and you roll a bunch of 6-sided dice and if you roll 10 or higher, you have what is called <i>Privilege</i>, which is that you get to say if your character succeeds or fails.  And, like I said, in D&amp;D, you roll the dice, and the dice tell you if you succeed or fail.  In this game, you roll the dice, and if you have <i>Privilege</i>, you get to say whether your character succeed or failed and and how he did it.  If you don't beat a 10 or higher, then the Game Master has <i>Privilege</i>, and he says whether you succeed or failed.  And I've been playtesting the game with a lot of different groups, and one of the groups I playtested it with was a hardcore D&amp;D group.  They play D&amp;D and that's pretty much all they play.  They've played other games, they didn\u2019t like 'em.  They play D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Chupp: Nothing wrong with that, nothing wrong with that at all.<br/><br/>Wick: No, no, D&amp;D is a combat simulation and what it does, it does it really well, and it makes a lot of people very happy.  (laughs) It's a new year, and I don\u2019t like pissing in other people's Cheerios.  Like I said, it is a game where we want to try to do something different that's not just D&amp;D and my Elves are taller.  So, I approached them with this game and said "This is how this works, if you roll 10 or higher, you get to see if your character succeeds or fails, and if not, then I do".  And their first response was the typical response I get, which is "Why would I want my character to fail?"<br/><br/>Chupp: (laughs)<br/><br/>Wick: And I said, "Well, we'll go through it, and you can play the game, and you'll find out why."<br/>So we're playing the game, and in <i>Houses of the Blooded</i> you play nobles.  Again, it's a counterpart to D&amp;D; in D&amp;D you play <i>Conan</i> \u2013 you play a wandering nomad who has no family, no friends, no history, he only has a future, and you have no money, you're dirt poor, and you go out and make your own fortune, and that's D&amp;D.  And in <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>, you're not playing <i>Conan</i>, you're playing <i>Elric</i> \u2013 you're a noble; you have an empire; you have money \u2013 you don\u2019t need to worry about money.  Money is not even an aspect of the game - it just doesn't even matter; nobody counts pennies in Houses of the Blooded.  Nobody counts copper pieces.  And you have everything, and what you're trying to do is get more, because the Ven always need more.  So the game isn't so much about acquisition as it is about \u2013 well, there's an acquisition part \u2013 but it's more about land, and romance and revenge and intrigue, and all these things, y'know that deals with.  <br/><br/>So they're playing nobles at a party, and one of things is that one of the players is playing a Spymaster, he's playing the big Lord's Master Spy.  And he -- the Lord has sent his Master Spy to follow his wife, to follow the Lord's wife, because he wants to know if his wife is cheating on him and having an affair.  Well, what he doesn't know is the Master Spy is having an affair with the Lord's wife and the Lord doesn't know this.  And with <i>Houses</i>, again, there are no notes.  There's no note passing, there's no secret talks \u2013 everything, there's a rule \u2013 everything happens above table.  So the player who is playing the Lord and the player who is playing the Spymaster both know that there is an illicit affair going on and it's happening---that these two players are part of the same triangle.  They both know it and because there are no secrets, the Lord gets to watch the other player carry out this affair with his wife.  It creates a really interesting dynamic.  One of the things--he's talking with the wife, and the wife says, "Does he suspect us?", and he says, "I want to lie to her.  I want to convince her that he doesn't know that she's having an affair."  And I said, "Go ahead and make a roll", and he makes a roll and he gets <i>Privilege</i> and he says, <b>"Ok, I'm going to lie to her and fail, so that she <i>knows</i> that I'm lying to her."</b>  And again, that kind of thing doesn't happen in a roleplaying game where everything is front-loaded because it's a binary question: did I succeed or fail?  Yes, I succeeded; no, I failed.  <b>And because the players have the opportunity to explain how they succeed, you get nuance, you get the ability to have not a binary answer, but a grey answer, and because that opportunity is there in the game mechanic, it creates a different kind of gameplay for the players.  And it took them a session to figure it out, and it was at that moment that the player looked at his dice and said, "I can succeed, but I want my character to fail", and that's when they figured it out..."</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119918/#Comment_119918" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T12:18:13+00:00" title="January 16, 2008 12:18PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            _Lovely_.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119923/#Comment_119923" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T12:39:00+00:00" title="January 16, 2008 12:39PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me!

What systems are you thinking of that are like this? I'm thinking of octaNe as one possible example.<br/><br/>John isn't exactly forging new ground here (pun intended). This is stuff first in texts, as far as I know, like The Pool. It's also fortune-in-the-middle, apparently. Cool! I'm all for those.<br/><br/>The conflict resolution here, mechanically speaking, is narration rights, or "rubber stamping." The game grants a particular player authority to resolve events at a given time (a roll, obviously). The player gets a 10? He gets to say how it goes down. Neat. <br/><br/>It's exactly like earning a Victory and narration rights in Nine Worlds. <br/><br/>And, presumably (but I don't know much about Houses of the Blooded) that resolution authority reverts back to the GM after the "thing" is resolved. <br/><br/>I'm curious to see how the game handles more complex conflicts. Does it allow multiple players to roll a 10? What happens then? Do they "share" Privilege? If not, how's it resolved.

Technically Capes works like this too although in practice people fighting on either side of Goal are usually split down the success/fail line.  I think The Pool as written is narration trading only as well but I don't play it that way. I use Ron Edwards "hard core" Pool variant rules when I play The Pool.<br/><br/>I saw a playtest version of The Committee For Exploration that worked along these lines.  I don't know if it still does but I didn't like the way that playtest worked.<br/><br/>So, no, John isn't forging new ground but his new term of Privilege is a good one.  I just dislike systems that determine narration rights only.  I much prefer systems that lock down success/failure of in-fiction character interests and then apply narration rules to decide who gets to add detail and nuance to that such as Primetime Adventures.<br/><br/>When I originally heard how Spione's mechanics work (no success/failure just narration ordering) I was a little worried but then I read the restriction that Principle Players can ONLY narrate to the benefit of the principle character's interests and Non-Principle Players can ONLY narrate to the detriment of the principle character's interests and my objections went away.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120006/#Comment_120006" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T18:05:04+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  6:05PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>Good stuff.

You paint a scene (I don't recall if the text specifies who "paints" it; when I play its usually the GM) and then you pick one of the qualities and roll some dice. If you roll high, you get to say what happens, within the parameters you describe. <br/><br/>But, as I understand, rather superficially, Houses of the Blooded is doing something very similar. I mean, in octaNe if I roll high, in essence, I have privilege to "fail," which I presume to mean I can narrate what happens, which might include me, say, having my Road Warrior lie to the Roller Girl or whatever, but that I also narrate she doesn't buy it and <i>what I want as a player happens regardless</i>. Seems like HoB is doing something almost the same thing. Right?\n<blockquote>I just dislike systems that determine narration rights only.

You could have it easy, but complications are so much juicier. There's also a social aspect to it. If your affair is secret at the table, then there's no benefit to narrating failure when success is possible.<br/><br/>Wel, in SotC, there's a very direct mechanical benefit for making your character's life harder. I prefer that because, as you imply, the benefit of failure is making the story more interesting. It just works better and makes that more obvious when there's a mechanical reward for making the story better. If those hardcore D&amp;D players had tried the game without Wick running, they might have never discovered that failure adds to the game. But with a mechanical device that draws you to the option, then you get more assured discovery that failure is also fun because it can add to the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120015/#Comment_120015" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T18:40:28+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  6:40PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2008 6:41PM by Matt Snyder.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, Jesse, try this on for size, and let me know if this hits some (or all?) of the same reasons you don't like the narration trading without fictional resolution you described: <br/><br/>First, let me say, that I don't know jack about Houses of the Blooded outside of this thread and a couple of John's LJ posts. So, I have no real idea if what follows is relevant to that game. <br/><br/>Ok, so if a game presents a narration trading mechanic that is ONLY that, I'm pretty turned off. Just like Jesse is, it seems. I'm really disinterested in systems that amount to people just deciding stuff without constraint.<br/><br/>It <i>appears</i> HoB makes failure <i>possible</i>, but it doesn't make failure <i>interesting</i>. That's the difference for me. Jesse?<br/><br/>Let me suggest how this might be a problem. <br/><br/>So, you're playing with your buddy the GM. And, a new guy and the GM's girlfriend are playing, too. <br/><br/>In one scene, you get Privilege and descibe how your character fails. And, it's really cool. Genuinely. Everyone oohs and ahs. Your guy really does suffer! It's meaningful. Fucking A, Drama! This is roleplaying! <br/><br/>Later, in another scene, the Girlfriend loses Privilege. But, fear not! Boyfriend GM swoops in and ... guess what? He makes her FAIL! Why? Well, Fucking A Drama, of course! He's gonna get laid because he didn't pull punches, made her "fail," but came out looking great because the real roleplaying ramped up a notch. Awesome! (Except, um, less awesome.)<br/><br/>Then, even later on, New Guy is playing through a scene. Uh oh. Everyone can sense he's not real sure how this works really well, and he really, really likes his kick-ass swordsman. He doesn't WANT to fail. But, he loses Privilege. Uh oh. Now what? Everyone else is failing! All the cool kids are doing it. GM swoops in again. Guess what? NO FAILURE! The guy succeeds, even though the player didn't win privilege. There is no reason that losing the roll constrains one's character to losing. It just means one person rather than another person decides what happens for themselves. "Oh, I decide this." or, "Oh, I decide that." Blah. <br/><br/>Now, again, HoB probably doesn't work like that. I really don't know. It also probably encourages complications for losing Privilege. In other words, it's all well and good for the GM to describe kick-ass swordsman derring-do success, but with a complication! This, the books tell us, is story in the making and good. ... ... but the mechanics didn't do a damn thing to enforce it. The GM just decided it. <br/><br/>Blah again. Not for me, personally. I'd much rather it works with these two possibilties, somehow: <br/><br/>1) "Failure" but with some beneficial or ulterior reward, i.e. "I make my guy fail, because it will rock, but also because lying to her will set my trap for later."<br/><br/>2) "Success" but with some complication, i.e. "Ok, my swordsman is still the greatest swordsman that ever lived. But, damn it! He didn't realize the captain of the guard he just eviscerated was the only person in the castle who knew the password."<br/><br/><br/>Constraint makes things <i>really</i> interesting and fun. It makes people get really creative, and it tosses surprises at a consistently high number of scenes. I really dig this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120147/#Comment_120147" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T10:25:18+00:00" title="January 17, 2008 10:25AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm seeing two things in that Wick excerpt:<br/><br/>a) No definition of what John really means when he says "failure" and<br/><br/>b) No differentiation between "failure" by the player and "failure" by the character.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120148/#Comment_120148" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T10:31:15+00:00" title="January 17, 2008 10:31AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are many, many things in Houses of the Blooded that I'm looking forward to seeing.<br/>With no snark intended, this mechanic isn't one of them.

The player says his intention that if I win the roll then my characters will fail.  It's up to the person on the other side to just understand that they are narrating the opposite.  As long as that's understood before we roll then I don't mind it as such.<br/><br/>In most of my designs I often have a success factor and a narration factor as two seperate resolutions.

I went back re-read the example and I can't tell from it where the in-fiction character's goal ends and the player's story aesthetic intention begins.  Is the fictional character genuinely wanting to lie in the eyes of his player?  Or the does the character subtly want to tip off his lover?<br/><br/>If it's the later than this isn't a conflict with the lover at all.  This is a conflict with the lover's husband and he succeeded!<br/><br/>The only game I know of that formalizes a difference between character intention and player intention is Elfs and there it does so for humerous effect.  If the idea is that House of the Blooded formalizes player intention seperately from character intention I'm a little more okay with that as long as the understanding is that the opposition (does this game have a GM?  I think it does) will undermine that intention if you don't get Privilege.  No wishy-washy "Player: Crap I don't have Privilege.  GM: That's okay I like your idea, here have it."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120949/#Comment_120949" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T09:42:24+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  9:42AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2008 9:44AM by Max Higley.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think people are getting task and conflict resolution confused.

Or at least that's how it sounds.<br/><br/>I, for one, am pumped about this mechanic.  It doesn't have the same scene-ending and roleplay killing implications that a lot of conflict resolution systems do, but also doesn't have the endless difficulty staircase effect present in a lot of task resolution systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121638/#Comment_121638" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T01:30:01+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  1:30AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite>The task was "lying to the Lord's wife" -- and the player chose to fail at that task.

I guess it really depends on context. I'm having some trouble sensing where the interesting tensions lie, as HotB is being described above. Competing to wear the Viking Hat seems to lack any sort of meaningful tension if it's not connected to stuff you're supposed to care about (i.e. your character, your narrative assets, whatever stuff you "own" in the gamespace).<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
