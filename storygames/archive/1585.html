                    Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
This is purely a question about ideas and goals.<br/>
<br/>
When you are creating a new game what is your itent, and what are your most haughty goals?<br/>
<br/>
The game I am developing is a focused game (low-level fantasy swords &amp; sorcery stuff) for a medium sized group of regular players that are very dissatisfied with the comercial products and want something that is "better" as they put it (with lots of 'we wanna do this' stuff thrown in).<br/>
<br/>
I realize that I am making this for roughly a group of 80 or so people, but have high intentions of it being marketable as an alternative to the 400 pound gorilla systems out there.<br/>
<br/>
when you make a game, is it because you have an epiphany and want to share it, or is it because you have a desire to make that one hit that will make your life?  What is it that drives you personally to make a game, other than you love it, and how does the reality of the product compare to your final result?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks                </div>

<p>When I design a game, it's usually to encapsulate a skill that I don't already apply automatically in play. It assists me in doing a task well - â€œBecause Iâ€™ve thought carefully about this once, at the design stage, I donâ€™t have to think about it in play, when my attention is being competed for.â€ By following the game's procedures, the skill applies itself.</p>
<p>That way, with each game that I play and learn, I expand my skill set a little, and it makes all my play a little better.</p>

                            I've only designed one game, and it was originally intended for my gaming group.  I wanted to create a game that they could learn quickly, and that they could enjoy playing.  They enjoyed the risk inherent in dice-throwing, but were unhappy with the high failure rate of most of the games that we were playing.  They kept saying, "I just want to hit something, and I don't want to be artificially bumped up five levels just to achieve competence" (or words to that effect).  So that's where my game design came from.<br/><br/>I also wanted to experiment with mechanics, and I wanted to design a game using the d12 (because it just seems like a very neglected die).<br/><br/>And finally, I wanted to create a horror game with truly repulsive demons and magic, because most of the games that I had played up to that point tended to focus on very familiar entities.  I wanted to create something foreign and unpleasant.<br/><br/>The final product turned out better than I had initially intended.  At first, it was going to be a photocopied-and-stapled zine-looking thing.  Not very polished or fancy, just something quick and dirty.  But, by the time it was over, I had created a 180-page perfect bound book with a color cover, and I wound up with a total of four reviews (which were mostly positive).  The mechanics were well-received, as were the demons and spells that I'd spent so much time pondering.  The presentation was not well-received; the artwork, layout, and level of polish were all areas that received criticism.  But, for the most part, the reviews forgave these failures, so I was pretty happy with the way that things turned out.<br/><br/>These days, my goal when creating a game is to visualize a user experience, then ensure that all of the content in the game document reflects this idea.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

                            My only intent when designing a game is to entertain people. That's it really. I don't really have any loftier goals. In the end I would like to think I may become good enough to make some kind of career out of it, but in the end my motivation is that I like playing games and wanted to see if I could do as well as, or better, than some of the games I play. My first game is not fully released yet, though you can buy some preview copies from IPR, so I will report back on the experience of finally getting something out there when it hits full publication.<br/>

                            I generally like to be creative and just, you know, "make stuff." So that's a big part of it. I get to create something and share it.<br/><br/>What's particularly cool in the gaming scene is that it becomes collaborative. In designing a game, I effectively make a musical instrument, and if I'm really lucky someone else will use it to write and play songs.<br/><br/>I also want to make games that allow me to express myself during play in ways that other games don't. The trouble is that now a lot of games seem to be fulfilling that need, and what I do might start looking more like total ripoff tweaks rather than clever originality.                        </div>

                            I'm with Matt - I'm really just like a toymaker or luthier ... I want to make beautiful or interesting things that other people can use to make beutiful or interesting things of their own - either by other games or through play.<br/><br/>Any money or recognition is beside the point - I've long given up on getting either.<br/><br/>Plus, no one is going to make the games that I really want to play - that's up to me.

<p>I'm kinda with Matt and Brian: for me, it's about making something creative that I want to exist that others can use to make things that <em>they</em> want to exist. I've got odd tastes and only by making what I want will I get it. Fortunately, enough others share my odd tastes that I can confidently disagree with Brian about the money part, and recognition comes when it comes. There's no point in worrying about it. People have surprisingly good taste, and if you make something good, they'll like it.</p>
<p>More specifically, I want players to be able to make difficult choices in a meaningful way. I want to see characters that are hard to sympathise with. I want sympathy for characters who you don't expect to be worthy of it. I want wild flights of fancy focused tightly so as to prompt the players to say cool and coherent things.</p>

<br/>
I have several specific goals for each of my designs:<br/>
<br/>
1.) Short to No Prep Time<br/>
2.) Playable in 1 to 5 sittings.<br/>
3.) Pack a whallop in 2-5 hours.<br/>
4.) Have a difinititive conclusion.<br/>
5.) Be readable in 30 minutes to 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
If I can do all that, I feel I've been successful.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
