                    Purgatory: Psychological Survival Horror<br/>
<br/>
After watching the Silent Hill movie, I yearn for a game based on Silent Hill 2 (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, the second and vastly superior installment in the game series).  The game will deal with horror, sin, guilt, and the potential for redemption, not of the town but of the protagonist.  It's part SH, part KULT, and part hippie mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the basic setup: There exists a place that attracts sinners.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a portal to Purgatory, filled with nightmares and horrors.  Only people with overwhelming guilt can enter, but they can bring innocents with them by accident.  Purgatory holds horrors taken from other sinnersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ nightmares (often based on how the portal was opened) and intuitively creates manifestations of the sinnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own guilt.<br/>
<br/>
First, the game is played at night by candle light.  Always.  No TV, no music, no snacks.  Just the players in a room full of shadows.<br/>
<br/>
Second, narration of Purgatory scenes work as follows: the GM describes the scene in a creepy way, and then the player has the chance to add to it.  If the player adds horrifying and disturbing details, it nets her tokens.  For example, the GM describes a twisted nightmarish office building.  He describes how corpses are tied to their cubicle spots with razor wire.  The player then adds that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not actually dead, just in constant torture.  Their eyes are crying blood, and their hands are the only free part of them, constantly typing Ã¢â‚¬Å“KILLME KILLME KILLME KILLMEÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â onto the flashing computer screen over and over again.  The constant keyboard clicking sounds form a crescendo of terror. The GM awards a token.<br/>
<br/>
Tokens are used to insert useful items in the scene somewhere, with crowbars being cheap and .44 magnum ammo expensive.  Healing bandages and things that soothe and comfort the horrified mind are also options.<br/>
<br/>
Invariably, deformed creatures stalk and attack the player character (aka Ã¢â‚¬Å“sinnerÃ¢â‚¬Â).  The player can try to fight them off or try to run.  The sinner can take wounds and be killed.  In addition, and this is the core part, the player can buy rerolls or other perks by creating a Ã¢â‚¬Å“guilt slotÃ¢â‚¬Â on their character sheet.  The player has the obligation, in the next scene, to reveal the guilt.  The sinner has done something bad; it can be a thought, an emotion, or an act.  There will be a requirement for rising severity.  An example would be Ã¢â‚¬Å“While my wife was withering away from cancer, I felt cheated that I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t having sex with that once gorgeous woman anymore and had to tend to a wreck instead.Ã¢â‚¬Â  ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a thought that people could have, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also one theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d feel guilty over.<br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thinking there might be a way for the GM to push guilt onto the sinner, as a revelation of the ultimate reason why the sinner is in Purgatory, but I need to think that over more.<br/>
<br/>
I have some preliminary thoughts on how to handle conflicts in scenes: for example, say Pyramidhead is coming for you with his huge sword.  You can try to fight him with your weapons (or bare hands), but the GM established him as quite powerful, so running seems like the better choice (each creature/encounter will have different values for fight, chase, and mindfuck, which you can counter with strength (yours or weapon), stamina, and will).  Now you make stamina rolls and we narrate how you try to get away.  The roll is somewhat difficult because of PyramidheadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speed and reach, but not as bad as if you tried to run from zombie dogs.  Each failed roll means he slices you, cutting into your shoulder or your leg, causing a wound that could add up to killing you.  This extended contest pushes you to open up guilt slots to finally get away before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late.  Once you succeed, you have a scene of peace and quiet during which you can bandage yourself, but also discover more horrors (and earn tokens, find items, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Every scene leads closer to endgame.  There needs to be a goal here: rescuing your daughter is the obvious one, just finding a way out another, or figuring out what created this particular Purgatory, or maybe even trying to seal it shut again.  The outcome of the endgame along with the guilt the sinner has revealed throughout the game determines the ultimate fate of the sinner.  She could be cleansed, commit suicide, be damned to remain in Purgatory as a sufferer or lost soul like some of the ones the sinner found during the game, etc.<br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thinking that in order for that to work well, there needs to be a way to redeem the revealed guilt.  Maybe making sacrifices or risking oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life for others (these situations would have to be offered by the GM as Bangs).  Those need to be tough sacrifices that have mechanical consequences.  Maybe the player can even ask for a redemption/reflection scene where she makes a roll (like a humanity check) to see if the revealed guilt can be overcome or leads further down the path of darkness.<br/>
<br/>
That's it for now.                </div>

                            I really like this, BTW.  Though it seems to be a framework that could be fit over most existing game systems (save for the attributes bits, which is great: Get the players to actually run for a change, and not stand and fightm thinking that "the GM wouldn't pull out anything that we couldn't defeat, after all..."). I particularly like the "players contribute to the scariness" bits...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I spent the last eight years putting together a massive (5 megabytes/500 pages) Silent Hill adventure/RPG, covering nearly every monster, location in four of the games so that players and GM can easily recreate any scene from the games (No NPCs though). <br/>
<br/>
I want feedback on it, so anyone who is interested in seeing it, give me your e-mail address. I'll attach it.<br/>
<br/>
Here's an excerpt describing the PCs battling the giant lizard from the first game: <br/>
<br/>
They shiver as they continue down into the inky blackness. Even with the gates and bars in the way they still feel anxious at the thought of being within sight distance of it. One can’t help but feel that they are heading into a deep abyss, where the greatest horrors this place has to offer awaits them. They are comforted to see that they aren't going to tumble end over end into the spiraling void: there is something solid in this darkness, something on which they can stand, a support of some kind. The only sound they can hear is the metallic, almost mechanic, drone, like valves turning, like pathways opening.<br/>
Taking a while, but eventually, the elevator begins to slow down and finally, with a loud grinding noise, shudders to a halt at what the PCs can assume is the bottom of the shaft. Numerous blades, hammers and spears mounted on clockwork gears spin and sweep along one wall. In another, sharpened metal pipes emit bursts of steam at regular intervals. <br/>
With the flashlight on, the PCs take a careful step forward. <br/>
Suddenly, something is noticed up ahead. It looks like another statue, only this one seems to be some sort of effigy: a straitjacket-clad body. The statue is tied to a wooden post up ahead, almost like a sick parody of an ancient witch-burning. Surrounding it is a metal barricade made up of metal spikes and grinding gears and such that prevent others from approaching it. <br/>
Suddenly, the figure is engulfed in flames, which erupt from the post. The figure slowly burns, and as the figure burns, the igneous spikes surrounding it move, rotating like some sort of grinding machine. A great furnace roars to life beneath it. Visitors can see that it is formed from a fused biomechanical mass of human bodies. <br/>
With the new illumination, they see that they are standing in a large circular room. They are unable to see the ceiling above, and the floor is metallic mesh bolted to thick metal strips fanning out from the center of the room where the burning body is. Sections of the steel grating making up the floor are torn away. The heat is oppressive, and the stench is sickening<br/>
You feel yourself starting to overheat. Badly. Something is very wrong here, and you want no part of it. No part at all. You just want the hell out of here but there isn't a door or anything. Nothing you can see. You feel panic rising.<br/>
They hear an approaching rumble like a freight train. Then they hear footsteps . . . footsteps that cause the floor beneath them to shake. Every single step sends a huge wave of shock through the floor. The pipes—which extend up into infinity—give a seismic shudder, and a large reed pipe tears raggedly open revealing a primal nightmare: <br/>
One word comes to mind, almost like a psychic scream, and the PCs know that it has to be this living nightmare's name. The Emperor Lizard. <br/>
The monster approaches slowly from the far end of the room, lit up behind the fire engulfing the body. Its eight blood-red eyes, four on either side of the head focuses on them. Its huge forearms crawl forward as the lizard draws closer to its prey. The body turns, and the stumps serving for legs begin a slow progression toward the PCs<br/>
Every bullet just ricochets off of its hard skin, with some sticking very firmly in its forehead. As it moves forward, scales drop from its skin, razor sharp, to slice and bury themselves into the chain link grating like skimmed metal shields. <br/>
A vile pink substance oozes down its forehead. After 1D4 melee rounds of combat the Emperor Lizard stops moving. It stays still for a melee. They may wonder if the last shot fired has killed the damn thing. <br/>
Suddenly, its head splits right in half. <br/>
But it doesn’t stop! <br/>
Its leathery green-brown skin separates where the indistinguishable head is to reveal a four-parted mouth, much resembling a flower. Rows of sharp teeth fills the petals of powerful skin until the oblivion of the throat, from which tears an ungodly roar of malice and hunger. <br/>
It is as if its head is a larger mouth.<br/>
Deep in its throat, in its bowels, glow innumerable souls, as tiny as the dolls of a child, as desperate and pained as victims of a torture-master. The screams of the souls fill the mind. The Emperor Lizard opens its mouth wider, simultaneously beckoning and challenging them to come forward, to test themselves against what is showing them.<br/>
Mouth agape, it streaks at them, terrifying fast. <br/>
It then runs with bursts of incredible speed. <br/>
Okay, just shooting it doesn’t work. There has to be some sort of weak point; a specific area they can target. But where? One thing is certain: unless they d osomething soon, they are going to end up as this creature’s latest meal. One can’t stay here dodging that hideous mouth forever.<br/>
The mouth <br/>
As soon as the lizard opens its jaws, they open fire. Round after round strikes the creature’s mouth with deadly precision. The monster grunts in pain. Its massive jaws slam shut as it charges at the prey that has wounded it.<br/>
With a final massive roar, the creature falls dead to the ground, blood leaking copiously from its disfigured mouth. Suddenly, a white burst of light immerses the entire chamber. The PCs try to block out the blinding light, but it penetrates through their eyelids, burning into their brains.<br/>
Two more heavy shockwaves of light roll across, the beast’s death song; then there is nothing in the chamber but empty, blessed silence; even the gears in the cavern below have at last stopped their grinding and ticking and turning. <br/>
The blinding light seems to flow over them, the corruption and filth washed away beneath the purifying tide. It swirled and congealed, the surfaces changing, the very world seeming to return to sanity with them. It is like reality itself is dissolving all around them. The intensity is too much, and they feel their consciousness fading from the assault on their senses.<br/>
The fire ceases to be.<br/>
All light is taken from the room.<br/>
Somewhere a siren is ringing, so loud now that one’s skull seems ready to crack open.<br/>
The siren shrieks, louder than the death song, and then both fade eventually.<br/>
The silence is soon broken by the distant tolling of a great church bell, stirring in the listener a compulsion to find its source.                        </div>

                            Pretty much the only games I try designing are Silent Hill 2 knock-offs, and I can never seem to get it just right, so I would love for someone to bring the awesome with a great system.                        </div>

                            So as not to completely derail Xenopulse's original post let me comment on it.<br/><br/>One thing I'm confused about: You make reference to "sinner" singular.  Are you talking about a single entity outside the PCs that has brought the Purgatory into existence?  Or are you talking about each individual PC?  Is the game meant to played with only one GM and one player?<br/><br/>I don't quite see how the guilt, sins, and purgatory hang together relative to the players.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>
