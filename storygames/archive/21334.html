(I teach protestant religion in a country where only roughly 2-3% of the population is protestant, so my classes are small) The teacher of Catholic religion also only had one pupil and came over to us asking if they could play a game. Having only a bunch of six sided dice with me and a sheet of possible character art (accidentally in my jacket pocket from when I took it with me to maybe play with the family at a feast) I suggested we do a story telling game.</i><br/><br/>I quickly explained how the game worked (none of the optional rules) and how to make a character, let them pick a portrait and cut and paste it on a small sheet of paper. All this in about 5-10 minutes. Then we still had about 20 minutes left before our class was over, so we got started. Neither the two kids had ever played a pen and paper rpg, but they did amazing.<br/><br/><b>Our Players:</b><br/>[I forgot the name of this character], a Jokester (4), Archer (3), Jumper (2) and Runner (1) met up with Cheese Puff*, a Cook (4), Soccer Player (3), Thief (3) were contracted by the Boss Baby to retrieve the Golden Cheese Puff* from the castle of Ying, Yang and Fox (These names were come up with by the players).<br/><br/><b>The Game:</b><br/>I started the game with them outside of the castle, not yet noticed and asked how they were gonna do this. They decided to have one of them distract the guards while the other one snuck in. Then the other guy had to come in and to help him with this Cheese Puff decided to set some traps to have the guards run into as the Character I forgot the name off ran towards the castle. I decided that since they had worked together the other one would know that traps were set. And it worked. The guards ran into the traps. I asked what kind of traps it were. The guy answered that it were pit traps. I ran with it. No need to bog down play with the question of how he dug multiple pits, unseen, in about 5 minutes of in-game time, and covered them to hide them. Magic Realism FTW.<br/><br/>Going further in they saw Ying and Yang playing table tennis in the guard lounge. They were on break. One was dressed all in white with a black dot on his chest, the other was dressed all in white with a black dot on his chest. They disposed of them in a way I don\u2019t really remember. I think sleeping arrows and a soccer ball to the face.<br/><br/>They were then confronted by fox who was disposed of with a Frying Pan to the back of the head. (A very creative use of the Cook Clich\xe9/Skill, which I approved off. They are 10/11 year olds.) Then they encountered the Golden Cheese Puff on it\u2019s shrine, discovered that it was trapped (Handy to have a Thief (3) with you) and defeated the Robot-Knights guarding it with only a sprained ankle between them. They retrieved the Golden Cheese Puff, brought it to the Boss Baby and got a promotion (an extra dice for the next game, should we ever play a new one) just in time for the bell signaling it was recess. <br/><br/><i>*Not the actual translation.

I left out all the options, but I also noticed that I forgot to explain the teamwork rules. This wasn't too bad since I hadn't played in a while, so I set the difficulty too low for them having to team up mechanically. Also, I treated most enemy encounters except the robo-knights "boss battle" as just a target number to beat, which coincidentally helped speed things along. So that wasn't too bad, but it wasn't "correct", even though I'll probably keep that approach in my back pocket for classroom play, since I usually only have pupils for 45 minutes, inwhich we also need to get in the room, hang away our coats, seat at a chair etc... so long games are out in this session.<br/><br/>Another thing that I found afterwards that I would have done different is how I played the NPC's. The time constraint kept me focused on moving it along, making me forget to do silly voices and gestures for the NPC's. Except for the robo-knights. I did the robo-voice and the stiff arm movements in my chair.<br/><br/>Mainly it made me see how prep would have made it a lot better, even though it was already a lot of fun. My pupil had his charactersheet with him the next time we had class, so yay, he liked it.<br/><br/>I now kinda want to prep a session for the last lesson we have before fall break, as on the 31st of Oktober, our protestant religion exists 500 years, and I want to kind of let the kids run through Martin Luther's struggles in some way.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467162/#Comment_467162" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-21T22:57:41+00:00" title="October 21, 2017 10:57PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice. I think that's a great idea! They would probably learn and remember a lot more that way, as well - e.g. if understanding the motivation of the anti-Lutherites gives me an advantage in the game, I'm more likely to learn about it and remember it later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
