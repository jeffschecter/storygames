They operate out of Virtual Dojos and get their missions from Sensei.Org in the form of e-mails coded to look like spam.<br/><br/>The ingredient phrases and others that I dig up will serve as "Special Moves" in the over the top Naruto-meets-Dragon Ball combat sequences.  For example, I see "Exquisite Replica" as a self-duplication power so that you know have twice as many attacks because there are two of you.<br/><br/>So, one part of the game, probably the climax of a story-line is a big virtual battle in cyber-space.  I want to have one set of stats for this, here are the front-runner candidates: Speed, Power, Accuracy, and Manuevers.  Tentatively, I would include also include a "Hit Point" like mechanic called "Fight" indicating "how much fight you have left in you".<br/>My primary struggle is with combat mechanics, but more on that in a minute.<br/><br/>I also want to have some other activity - sneaking, investigation, battles with mooks, other weirdness.  For this stuff, I see simple rolls determining success - probably d6 + adds comparison.  For this, I see skills like Stealth, Puzzles, Aptitude, and Motivation.  Aptitude and Motivation are definable to help provide color to the character.  (Aptitude might be Freelance Writer, Burger Jockey, Corporate Drone, or something else that describes what the character does in thier 'day job'.  Motivation explains why they are involved in the secret war: "To Find My Sister", "To Get The Latest Video Games", "To Avoid A Serious Relationship", etc.)<br/><br/>After all that set-up, here is what is keeping me up at night:  I can't settle on a combat mechanic.<br/>Some things that are appealing:<br/><br/>* Different stats having different impacts: Speed determines number of attacks, Accuracy determines likelihood of hitting, Power determines how much damage is done, Manuevers may just track how many special attacks you know.<br/>* A DRYH-like mechanic where some or all of them create a pool of dice to determine successes, but the dominating stat determines description.  ("I rolled 5 successes, and Speed dominates.  I unleash a flurry of attacks that overwhem my opponent.")  <br/>* Maybe a combination: Maybe Speed and Pool create the pool of dice, but Accuracy determines the success number. Dominating pools drive description, as well as, charge up special maneuvers.<br/><br/>I would also like the non-combat rolls to impact combat in some way.  Perhaps adding bonuses based on success.  "I rolled 3 higher on my Stealth check, so I get to add 3 dice to my first attack." or "The bad guy has my would-be-girlfriend captive - I am going to the add the extra successions from my Motivation check to my Fight pool."<br/><br/>I guess that's all my thoughts for the moment.  I feel like maybe I've started to answer my own questions as I worked through them, but I would like to hear other people's reactions and thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103233/#Comment_103233" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T08:42:06+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  8:42AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, this is terrific.<br/><br/>Some questions. Are the ninjae people or programs? What's the technology behind these entities getting online? Are they search engine-like avatars, or part of a weird pseudo-game environment? Are they like 4chan Anons, invading other spaces and causing havoc? Are they for hire, or do they do it for the lulz?<br/><br/>Systemwise, I like your DRYH mechanic. You could have an enemy's traits determine your target numbers - their Evade is 3, so all your Accuracies have to be 4 or more. That gets you using multiple pools to fight enemies and aim for their weak points. <br/><br/>I really like the 'charge' idea. And I'd like to see non-combat abilities make a difference in combat, coz that makes for all kinds of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103263/#Comment_103263" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T11:02:35+00:00" title="October 16, 2007 11:02AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My responses to your questions based on my original thinking:<br/><br/>The characters are people with real jobs and real lives. But they have Ninja Avatars in a weird psuedo-game environment overlaying the Interwebs.  That was one of the early things I was struggling with, where to draw the line.  And I like the line in the middle.  (As I type this up, it sort of has a bit a Code Lyoko vibe - the action primarily takes place in the Interwebs, but there is impact on and some action in the real world.)<br/><br/>I was thinking of just hand-waving the technology of getting on-line. In my mind's eye, it is something about midway between the World of Warcraft MMORPG and the holodecks from Star Trek. I have this image in mind of someone sitting in front of a computer screen wearing a VR helmet and gloves.<br/><br/>The Ninjae are organized in Virtual Dojos with various goals and methods. Some are for hire, some are driven by lust for power, some just like causing havoc. I envisioned the players playing heroic characters seeking to oppose evil clans bent on invading web-spaces and causing havoc, but certainly that's flexible.<br/><br/>Individual characters have various reasons (Motivations) for getting involved, but there are some consistencies: they had to be bright enough to decode the initial Spam-encoded invitation (Puzzles) and they had to have the natural inclination for some subtlty (Stealth). <br/><br/><br/>Some other thoughts for context.  I am strongly leaning toward a GM-less game, with the scenarios designed by the group based on an actual spam e-mail.  "This e-mail talks about the Hong Kong Real Estate market.  I propose all the virtual settings be based on the appearance of downtown Hong Kong."  I would want to link an economy to this rewarding cool descriptions and am toying with basing the number of "Yes, and..." facts a player can add on their Puzzles score. (The rationale being that the character is decoding additional facts from thier Sensei.org message.)<br/><br/>I am thinking that in building the setting, players can build in improvement opportunities ("If you pass the Stealth check in scene 3 you gain another point of Stealth, but if you fail...")<br/><br/>I am toying with the idea of the opposition being calibrated similar to the game Rune.  Basically, the big boss has a Speed equal to the second highest Speed in the party plus some number, etc.  This bothered me intially, because it meant that the boss would always have the same stats, but I think I have two solutions:<br/>(1) During the scenario design/"decoding" phase, the players decide where the boss gets specific strengths and weakness - possibly with strengths corresponding to improvement opportunities.<br/>(2) If I stick with the Ninja-as-Avatar concept, the Avatars could be flexible and changed between stories - allowing the base stats of the Boss characters to shift at the same time.  ("I played a fast character last time, I'm going to go with strong this time.")  Or maybe, taking a cue from MMOs, the characters has a number of set Avatars that advance independently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103282/#Comment_103282" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T12:28:32+00:00" title="October 16, 2007 12:28PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm having a strong desire for there to be an actual site that generates the spam email messages for the players ... possibly through the web rather than email, to stop the secret orders being eaten by spam checkers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
