You find them and dismantle them, with extreme prejudice.<br/><br/><b>The Characters: </b>With this set-up, Jef, Lisa and Andy at the MKRPG came up with a group of 3 agents taking orders from the circumspect Mr. Lithgow. Jef was Martin Turnbull, a grifter saved from jail by being press-ganged into service; Lisa was Cpt. Jane Blunt, a court martialled soldier with the deaths of her men on her conscience; Andy was John Anderson, a hacker saved from a cult that the organisation took down before recruiting him.<br/><br/><b>The Mission:</b> As the players tossed out ideas for their characters, I stirred it around and came up with<i> 'Broken Empire'</i>, a British MMORPG set in a post-apocalyptic near future, with players of the game divided between Imperialists and Republicans. In his terse briefing, Mr. Lithgow alluded to a number of shooting incidents, including two at army bases, and suggested they look into the company's involvement.<br/><br/><b>The Mechanics:</b> I'd sketched out a simple version of the rules to work with, which involves each agent having six skill cards; any skill card can be played when faced with a challenge to succeed at it, but at a price or drawback. If the skill is appropriate to the task, there is no drawback and if the skill has a special advantage on it that relates to that specific task, then not only does the agent succeed, but they get some additional advantage or opportunity.<br/><br/>Players can also choose to fail tasks: they can simply play no card, in which case they fail but still get something positive out of it, or they can simply fail and regain one used card, or even fail disastrously, with big complications, to get all their used cards back.<br/><br/><b>The Denouement: </b>The final confrontation occurred at the HQ of the game company on an industrial park at night, during a black-out and terrorist repsonse situation created by the agents. They found out something was up with the servers that ran the game, which were somehow influencing events in the real world, but Cpt. Blunt blew it all up before they could get to the bottom of things, though Anderson the hacker did memorise some of the weird code he saw...<br/><br/><b>The Assessment:</b> I'm really pleased with the way it went; it didn't take too long to explain the mechanics and the choices of skills the players made went a long way to setting the tone of the game, as I'd hoped it would, e.g. there were lots of skills like persuasion, manipulation, surveillance, computing and contacts, so it was obvious they wanted or expected a heavily investigative game. Only Lisa's character reallly had any combat ability, which made instances of action and violence rare but dramatic.<br/><br/>We only had a few minutes to talk about the game after it finished, with one suggestion being that it should be easier to get back cards when you really want them (currently, you rely on a skill card having a drawback on it in order to get it back once used) but further discussion suggested that the system as written might really come into its own in campaign play, with agents adding more cards to their stock, giving them a wider repertoire of skills, advantages and drawbacks. For example, I explained to Andy that his hacker character might be able to add a card to his stock that enabled him to control people's actions by exposing them to the code he'd memorised.<br/><br/>This still needs some more testing to iron out the best ways to pick skills and other character aspects, as well as the best way to pitch the game and teach the mechanics, but I'm very happy with this early runthrough.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389217/#Comment_389217" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T16:00:51+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  4:00PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is [Excision]?
