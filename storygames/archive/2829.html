I don't really know why, but over in a discussion about DitV on RPGNet, someone inadvertantly hit hte nail on the head, i think:\n<blockquote><cite>azrianni</cite>What helped me was reading a lot of the stuff over on the forum on the forge and coming to understand that my role as GM wasn't to try to win conflicts but make players make tough decisions about taking blows or escalating.</blockquote>\nNow, here's my problem: how do you do that? I don't know if it's me, or the players, but it seems like every time i try and do that (well, not every time, but much of the time), there is no agonizing, no questioning: the decision is "obvious" to the player(s) involved. Some examples, to try and illustrate:<br/><br/>In our current space opera Dust Devils game, they are archaeologists who've discovered an Awesome Alien Tech machine--it's pretty much a blatant rip-off of the giant machine within Epsilon III in B5, or the machinery in Forbidden Planet. Now, the first dilemma was supposed to be how they deal with a couple of political fanatics, brothers, who arrived there at roughly the same time. I expected them to worry about the hard choice of approaching them cautiously--can they be trusted? Instead, they just immediately went to booby-trapping their spaceship and using force. Then i tried to play out the brother they had apprehended as a fanatic, yes, but someone who might have valid concerns about the gov't (which we'd established as at least bordering on despotic--definitely modeled on the Alliance in Firefly and the Federation in Blake's 7), expecting them to have to weigh supporting the "right" side when they might be using "wrong" methods, or debate whether it is good, or even acceptable, to let this powerful machine fall into the hands of either revolutionaries or the gov't. Instead, they completely dismissed any claims the brothers might have had, making the decision a non-issue.<br/><br/>When we left off last, they had possession of the machine, and were making headway at understanding/controlling it. I tried to make it clear that (1) they had, or could gain, complete control of the machine; (2) it's pretty much a doomsday weapon--or deus ex machina, depending on how they choose to use it: other than moving it from the planet or travelling in time, they can do pretty much anything. The point is that it's not a tactical decision--if they want to do it, they probably can; it's supposed to be an ethical decision: what should they do? So far, at least, it hasn't occurred to them to consider the ethical implications of using it, it's just a given that they will, for whatever they want. <br/><br/>In a previous campaign with the same group, one of the characters (played by one of the players who currently is completely sidestepping any moral responsibility) was presented with the choice between going against the wishes of the rest of the group in order to achieve what he believed was, essentially, apotheosis, while knowing full well that there was some very real chance he would be releasing a demonic being with designs on that group, and perhaps the whole of civilization--and probably the power to make a real go of it; and giving up probably his only chance at achieving his lifelong dream (actually, an unfulfilled multi-generational dream of his entire society) in order to protect his friends (and the rest of civilazitoin, quite possibly). He agonized for weeks, and finally set up an elaborate plan to try and eat his cake and have it too, which only partially worked: he got his apotheosis and protected the friends, but still lost their trust, and in fact they wouldn't believe him that they were protected--which wasn't helped by the fact that he *was* corrupted to a certain degree, against his will. So his apotheosis was quickly followed by being forced to fight his friends, at first just in self-defense, and then die at their hands (though not before nearly killing them, once he started fighting for real). <br/><br/>So it's not that this group is incapable of giving real gravitas to big moral dilemmas. They just don't seem to be able to do so in games that are supposed to revolve around that. Have i given enough info for someone to have some insight? Why am i utterly failing to engage them when playing Dust Devils, and why are they resorting to tactical play--and, yes, the obvious has already been done: before we even started play, we had a lengthy discussion about (1) what I, at least, was missing from our previous games, (2) what everyone wants out of the game, (3) how Dust Devils differs from other RPGs, and (4) specifically that the point of the mechanics is not "what can you do?" so much as "what are you willing to do?".<br/><br/>Anybody have any suggestions on how i make sure to ask the right questions, and pose th right dilemmas? Otherwise, I'm gonna explode with, "Dammit! Quit making tactical decisions--yes! you can do that! ok!? Now, can we quit worrying about that and start considering the implications, already?", and not in a friendly tone of voice. Or could it be that that *is* what i need to say (but politely, and in-control)? I'm not sure i've actually said it in so many words (though i *thought* i had, before play began). I really don't know whether it's me, them, or both.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64212/#Comment_64212" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T16:48:40+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  4:48PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like the characters, and through them, the players, don't have any real investment in what's happening in the story.<br/><br/>Get the players to tell you what their characters want. If you ask, and they don't tell you, they suck. When they tell you, make sure what they want is something that's not easily attainable, like a sandwich or a job in retail.

(And let me just say, it's pretty damn cool that you're using and asking about DD!) Whereas, the apotheosis thing seemed to.<br/><br/>Players, especially in Dust Devils, aren't motivated  by "You can do anything with this!" They're movtivated by This Thing, Right Here. In the case of the Doomsday weapon, let's say that one of the characters has a Devil where he participated in Blowing A Planet Up, maybe to help fight some war or something. AND, he finds out that the guys who ordered him around to Blow Up said planet are after the weapon again.<br/><br/>So, we might imagine a scene where they confront him, trying to convince him to give him the Big Weapon. And, he can choose. Agree? Fight 'em? Delay? What? <br/><br/>See the difference? <br/><br/>The difference is this: Doomsday weapon = Boring. There's no LOCAL conflict about any specific character. <br/><br/>But, bring it home, hit the characters where they live (i.e. their own shitty choices in the past in Dust Devils), and now the people playing the game are interested. Instead of "Holy crap -- another end of the universe machine. How many Death Stars are there anyway!" it is instead "Holy Crap! If we don't do what these jerks say, we'll lose the money AND they'll take my wife with 'em!"<br/><br/>Your players SEEM (again, not certain just from your one post) to be making tactical decisions because you're putting them in nasty, big situations that don't compel them to take risks. They're just playing lots of role-playing games, which is to say their top priority is <i>surviving</i>. Dust Devils explicitly (in both editions) tells players to NOT do that, not just "play it safe."<br/><br/>Instead, bring it home, big time. Whip out personal relationships, usually messy ones, that get involved. Maybe think of it the lottery winner cliche: "I won a zillion dollars and now everyone wants to be my friend all the sudden. Cousin Joe never calls me, and now here he is!"<br/><br/>So, with the doomsday device, that cliche becomes "Now that we've got this darn megaweapon, everyone wants to talk to us (or shoot us)! My ol' contact Jabba-Whacky never gave me the time of day, now I'm his number one target! And he owes me big!"<br/><br/>Last bit of advice: That people aren't <i>agonizing</i> says nothing about whether they're making decisions that make for AWESOME game play. Lots of times, I've played with people who didn't agonize one bit! They grinned, knew exactly what they wanted to do, did it, and everyone around the table's jaw hit the floor. It's awesome. So, agonizing itself is not the drama process, but it might be one side-effect of good drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64215/#Comment_64215" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T17:32:18+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  5:32PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lose lose situations are very common in real life and tend to result in the most significant decisions in RPGs.  Do we turn the virus over to the government (who can synthesize a cure, but in the process masters the virus) or destroy it (when there might be other samples out there without a cure)?  Do we rescue the child from her abusive father (thereby protecting her from physical abuse) only to turn her over to the adoption system (which results in different problems)?  If we confront her abuser he may stop, but he may take out his frustration on the child...<br/><br/>I think the ethical decision with regard to the powerful machine would work better if it was clear the characters couldn't maintain control of it indefinitely.  Then the question is: What to do with it now?  Do we turn it over to others?  Do we destroy it?  Who deserves this power?  Why?<br/><br/>I don't find "What do you do with the power of a god?" to usually work very well because most folk haven't built characters with an eye to that level of scope.  In the case you presented, I don't see any clear consequences for using the machine to do anything.  I think for a decision to be meaningful the consequences have to be generally known, otherwise it's a random shot in the dark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64217/#Comment_64217" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T17:53:48+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  5:53PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now, the first dilemma was supposed to be how they deal with a couple of political fanatics, brothers, who arrived there at roughly the same time.</blockquote>\nThis is the first red flag for me. When you say "the first dilemma was supposed to be..." what do you mean? Why was this <i>supposed</i> to be the dilemma? Was this what the character's kickers (Devils) were pointed at? Did the players suggest this dilemma in some proto-form? Or was this a bang that you prepared? If the latter, it sounds like the bang fizzled. Probably for reasons that others have mentioned so far.<br/><br/>With this type of gaming, it's basically impossible to put a situation in front of the players that they're "supposed" to react to. Maybe they don't care about the ethics of doomsday weapons. That's fine. Move along to the next thing. Poke them with a different stick and see if there's a reaction. Hopefully, you're playing a system that gives you good flags, and you're talking to your players about these issues.<br/><br/>Getting back to the Doomsday weapon, though. If this was something that the players pointed you toward (even abstractly) and it's just not clicking as well as it might, I'd try to escalate. They found a Doomsday weapon, okay. Give them someone to use it on. A planet starts bullying its neighbors and stealing stuff. This planet has few resources and wants to advance its status in the galaxy. They have a big ol' fleet of pirate ships, and they're using them. Be sure to tie these pirate types AND their victims directly into the relationships of the PCs, then you're cooking.<br/><br/>Now it's not an abstract dilemma. Now "do we use the Device?" is rooted in specific people and places and problems. Have the NPC relationships show up and start telling the PCs what to do with it, asking for aid, threatening them with retribution if they use it, etc.<br/><br/>Consider the difference between, "Will I vaporize a planet full of people I think are bad?" and "Will I vaporize a planet full of bad people to help out my Uncle? Will I stop if my love-interest asks me to?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64218/#Comment_64218" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T17:57:45+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  5:57PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll also say (to add to what Matt said) that a lot of gamers have been trained to create PCs that care about nothing and have no attachments, in order to be "safe" from being pushed around by the GM.

Do the characters have lovers?  If the answer is yes to either, use them as NPCs and embed them in the situation, not as victims, but as active participants.  If the answer is no... get new characters.<br/><br/>Long Form:<br/>It seems to me that the characters have no direct ties to the situation that you are presenting them with.  By 'direct tie' I mean an emotional relationship (love, loyalty, idealism, revenge) to a person, place, or thing (but mostly people).  If they're big rebels versus the big scary Alliance, they need a Rebellion to join with leaders both inspirational and frustrating and with comrades both engaging and vulnerable.  And note, by 'engaging' I don't mean "had a good talk about how the alliance sucks" but "started talking about the alliance, got onto the subject of families, ended up in bed, and somehow promised to give her a baby when the revolution is over."  If your players don't care about the tough decisions, it's because the stakes aren't things that they really, truly, and viscerally care about.<br/><br/>As John points out, a lot of gamers have learned not to make real and visceral connections in games for fear of being dicked around by the GM.  "Bad" GMs use those connections to control the PCs.  Thing is, you as the GM need to those visceral connections in order to confront them with tough choices.  You may need to make it explicitly clear that you will use such connections to make decisions harder, not to push for the decision that you want them to make.  You may need to say this many times, and demonstrate.  They may still not believe you.  Such is life.<br/><br/>Nat, think back over your unsatisfactory gaming and ask, "Why did the PCs care about the conflict?"  If the answer is something pansy-ass like "friendship" (which is often just glossed-over loyalty between the <em>players</em>, not the characters), then you're not hitting them where they care.  The reason that the PCs care needs to be embodied in something in the game: an NPC, a home, a father's sword.  If it's tied up with something like "friendship" or "patriotism" then they're not connected to the situation.  Make what they care about concrete, and you will see a lot better results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64224/#Comment_64224" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T19:41:42+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  7:41PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone's giving you terrific advice.

If you've got four players around your table and all of them are interested in playing a game <i>right now</i> where the characters are faced with agonizing decisions, you're set.  If one or two of them are just coming off a particularly stressful week (maybe having had to make real-life agonizing decisions of their own), or if two of them played especially angsty characters in the previous game and would rather not repeat themselves so soon, well...too bad, you're out of luck.  It really doesn't matter if it's a style of game that everyone likes if everyone isn't actually interested in playing it <i>today</i>.<br/><br/><br/>It might be possible to compartmentalize a game, to give the agonizing decisions and gravitas-laden scenes to the characters who want them, while keeping those situations far, far away from the characters who don't.  It's tricky, though: unless the players of the non-emotionally-tortured characters agree to keep their mouths shut and bow out when the scene is clearly not meant for their characters, you'll end up with one PC's anguish over what he should do next being immediately interrupted by "Aw, quit yer whining and just push the button, dumbass."  Likewise, you might get a PC hogging the spotlight to replay three acts' worth of <i>Hamlet</i> while the less-drama-centric PC is bored to tears.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mytholder" title="mytholder"><img alt="mytholder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mytholder">mytholder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64249/#Comment_64249" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T04:05:56+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  4:05AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd add in another factor - if there's a single group opposing the player characters, then the decision turns from "what do we do" to "how do we beat them"? A single antagonist _becomes_ the problem. If you put in a second opposing group, then you make the choice manifest in the game. In the example of the Big Giant Machine, you had the PCs vs the Fanatics. If you added in a government scouting party on the planet, then it becomes a choice for the PCs between the Fanatics (right goals, wrong approach) and the Government (wrong goals, right approach).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64257/#Comment_64257" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T07:29:30+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  7:29AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2007 7:34AM by woodelf.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooo! Mytholder's last comment is the one that clicked for me, for the current game: you're absolutely right, i gave them only one obvious obstacle/opposition. Yes, i tried to imply a 'lesser of two evils' sort of situation, but it's pretty obvious i failed at it.<br/><br/>Lots of the other comments were helpful, too. I'll see what i can implement before the next session. Thing is, i know how to present a tactical problem. I'm not sure i know how to present an ethical problem. So i'm quite confident that those of you who diagnosed the situations (i.e., my contributions to the story) as a large part of the problem, by pushing/suggesting the "wrong" kind of solution are almost certainly right. Even if there are additional contributing factors.<br/><br/>Two specific things to call out: Yes, we have family. In fact, the PCs are all family, and part of a larger Dune-esque guild/family. So there are plenty of people "on their side", not all of whom they necessarily like, or even give a damn about. And plenty of other factions (other guild-families) that can be introduced (we've only glossed over the specifics, but bringing one of them in is probably a good idea). Trying to draw in the family thing is why the initial folks-with-conflicting-goals i tossed their way were brothers. I probably did a poor job of it. Hmmm... probably time to have the brothers' family *and* the PCs family show up (or at least send messages) and attempt to exert influence. As you say, give them someone to care about. That should help me make the decision more visceral, and tie it into something they care about.<br/><br/>As to the caring, and the players: yeah, that is unfortunately part of the problem. Unfortunately, for social reasons, i'm stuck with one player who absolutely loathes intra-party conflict [to the degree that he'll subvert characterization without even considering other options, in order to avoid it], and a different player who leans towards the power-fulfillment fantasy, and thus tends to play his characters almost in pawn stance--he *does* characterize, but almost inevitably in ways that leave him free of obligations or other external influences on how he can behave/respond. So he almost always plays it safe, and the first guy almost never questions the sensibility of self-sacrifice. Still, while it may not be their first choice of play, i think both are mature enough to play a game like Dust Devils "right", if i can just convey it properly. <br/><br/>I dunno. A part of me thinks that, once everyone gets their head into the right space, something like this [Dust Devils] will be perfect. And a part of me despairs of ever finding a game that can keep the whole group happy. I don't know whether to push further into Narrativist territory, with something like DitV, to try and break old habits, or go for a compromise game, like Buffy or maybe Shadows of Yesterday (something with more tactical hooks for the players who want it, without the  overwhelming need to master the tactical side that something like D20 System presents).<br/><br/><i>[edit: the reason i think this is a good match is that this is what all of the players like in their fiction--they're drawn to TV shows that are all about flawed characters struggling with those flaws, and often failing, and reject similar-genre/similar-theme shows that don't have that feature. And they've never really been introduced to RPG mechanics that actually support or even focus on this, so it's a bit alien to them, and thus off-putting. So, it's not just me projecting my preferences onto the group, it's trying to cast about for a system that hits their common interest (drama) without being off-putting to anybody (i.e., crunch is bad for at least one of us).]</i><br/><br/>I probably have more thoughts, and will seek more advice, but i've been up for 36hrs, so now i shall sleep until i must go to work again. Once i'm rested, i'll re-read, and see if anything more clicks for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64258/#Comment_64258" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T07:35:14+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  7:35AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's nothing wrong with pawn stance for this.

If not everybody is interested in something, getting them to grudgingly agree to do it is not the same thing as getting them to like it.<br/><br/>That said, you might try alternating games -- tactical kill-everything-that's-not-us play one week, crotch-punching narrativism the next week.

Pendragon might also work well, that has plenty of tactical weight without too many rules but also has support for issues of conflicts of loyalty and passion.<br/><br/>But ultimately, I think the issue here is trying to fix a non-system problem with a system fix.  The answer when your group has a mix of thematic story-types, some door kickers and a powergamer is to create adventures or dynamic situations which include some opportunity for those various things to happen.  The answer is not generally IMO to start breaking up your group.  That unless you are very lucky is a great way to end up with no gaming, and while no gaming is better than bad gaming I don't think those are the only choices on offer when you have a group with disparate tastes.<br/><br/>Generally I consider learning how to manage different player preferences part of the skill of being a GM, I'm surprised how swiftly people seem to assume it's impossible.  Tons of folk do it all the time, Robin Laws wrote a whole book of advice precisely on this topic.  If anyone is way too extreme it breaks down, that's happened to me where one player was so intent on butt kicking that it pulled the whole game that way until it became unfun, but that's one guy over years of coping without great difficulty with a variety of player types in the same group, both as a GM and as a player.<br/><br/>Most groups contain divergent play preferences, that's why it's important to learn how to offer a bit for everyone, waiting until you can get a group with all the same preferences is unrealistic and frequently just not feasible (assuming it's even desirable, and I doubt that too).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64273/#Comment_64273" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T09:02:12+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  9:02AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2007 9:02AM by Matt Snyder.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>There's nothing wrong with pawn stance for this.

Indeed, in the context of a game with entirely fictional inhabitants it's entirely possible there is no issue which will give him pause at a player level.  The answer to that is to have thematic questions for them as wants them and to have him laying the smackdown while they ponder them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64275/#Comment_64275" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T09:10:03+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  9:10AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is interesting stuff here about the need for player buy in, I remember once on the Forge reading about some RQ game Ron was running.

Well, assuming within a game context there are any at all (and if there aren't we're going to have to find a game which isn't so focussed on these questions) you use a game which makes me tell you, such as Dust Devils.  That's the whole point of the Devil or of Kickers or mechanics like that, they tell you what I as a player care about and want to address.  That's why they're useful mechanics.<br/><br/>Assuming of course that the player has any interest at all in addressing ethical issues, if not you're better off with another game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64287/#Comment_64287" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T13:41:24+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  1:41PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ohhh, okay.

I dunno. A part of me thinks that, once everyone gets their head into the right space, something like this [Dust Devils] will be perfect. And a part of me despairs of ever finding a game that can keep the whole group happy.</blockquote>\nUh, Nat... you realize how tall an order this is, right?  If not everybody is interested in something, getting them to grudgingly agree to do it is not the same thing as getting them to like it.<br/><br/>That said, you might try alternating games -- tactical kill-everything-that's-not-us play one week, crotch-punching narrativism the next week.  Setting them out explicitly as different games with different emphases, and making it clear that playing in one does not mean you have to play in the other, may help highlight the distinctions.<br/><br/>You know, now that you put it that way...yeah, it does sound like a tall, if not unreasonable, order. I wonder if that is what i'm asking them? I thought i was just asking them to "play it right"--you know, like asking someone on a weekend softball team to "take the game seriously" and not do stupid shit for no reason--and not expecting them to change their worldview in the process.<br/><br/>But, yeah, this whole game was explicitly set out as an alternative: "ok, we've just done a whole bunch of this tactical crunchy stuff [~2yr campaign, with only minimal alternatives along the way], and i know this game isn't to all of your tastes, but it is exactly to the tastes of [the player who is least interested in and least happy with tactics or crunch], so how about we all give it a fair shake for a short campaign?" I don't think the players aren't giving it their yeoman try--i just think that we're all sufficiently unfamiliar with what's expected, that we're sorta floundering. <br/><br/>Frex, i did *not* read Devils as kickers--what i got from the rulebook was that having a specific resolvable situation they were tied to was bad, they should be more general, ongoing facets of a character. So none of the PC's Devils provided a kicker to start the game. And they shot down the group kicker i wanted to use--being fugitives--which would've provided me with a nice strong crucible. But one of the player has a really powerful aversion to playing anything but the heroes, and wasn't even comfortable with playing charactres that are fugitives because they did the right thing and the gov't is wrong/corrupt. <br/><br/>So, yeah, i *think* i've made explicit that this game needs to be played in a different manner. Maybe they just don't get how different (they're thinking "different like Settlers of Catan is different from Powergrid" when it's actually "different like baseball is from Powergrid"). I don't, currently, have a large enough circle of gamers to actually do games that last more than one session and deliberately exclude part of the group, limiting us to games that fall somewhere in the compromise zone. Right now, in addition to trying to implement some of these suggestions tomorrow, i'm trying to decide whether to take some time to talk about what people want from their RPGing (because i suspect some assumptions are being made--probably on my side, too), because that'll take some effort to provide enough vocabulary to most of them to communicate effectively, based on previous attempts at such conversations (most of them can't really articulate what it is they like, so i've been trying to suss it out by watching--and i think the married couple are both afraid to come out and say what they really want, because i think they have the same  feeling i do: that it's almost diametrically opposed); or put it off for a month, because one player graduates and leaves town in 4 weeks, and we'll be lucky if we get 2 more sessions in before then, anyway. And i may be able to recruit 3 more players after that point, which would at least provide more bodies for rotating membership based on game.<br/><br/>All that said, I'm with Balbinus: I don't think our preferences are irreconcilable, even if it'll mean compromise at best. I believe it should be possible for us to figure out how to play together so that noone is unhappy, even if several of us aren't as happy as we might be in a group with shared preferences--after all, we have sufficiently compatible tastes to handle a lot of other activities together (board-/cardgames, movies, dinners--now *that's* the tough one: "anything, as long as there're no veggies" plus "anything, as long as there're lots of veggies" is a hard combo).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64606/#Comment_64606" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-21T00:03:03+00:00" title="April 21, 2007 12:03AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I think your group's preferences, by your own description, are too diverse to find such a game.

Leaving me playing by myself until i find/create more gamers. I prefer to start from the assumption that we *can* play well together, it's just a matter of some effort to identify exactly how, and then to do it. And, in the long run, yes, i'd like to grow a few new players of my own, and try and cultivate those with more-similar tastes. But those with the similar tastes keep giving up RPing because they don't have the time or aren't sufficiently interested, while those with the less compatible tastes are the ones that're always ready to game. I'm sure there are story-driven hardcore gamers out there, but i never seem to find them--all the hardcore gamers are also Gamist-favoring (which, given the relative market shares of D&amp;D3E and Universalis, i guess shouldn't surprise me so much).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64607/#Comment_64607" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-21T00:07:21+00:00" title="April 21, 2007 12:07AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Ohhh, okay.

Kat was playing a conditioned Doctor who was brokering a deal with the 9 for some forbidden tech for the Baron she served (the Baron is also a PC).
