This has got me thinking about them and what they are good for and what they aren't so good for.  And I hoped that some people out there on S-G, particularly people that have written and published RPGs might be able to shed some light on some of my ponderings.<br/><br/>First something that just struck me yesterday:<br/>from a legal standpoint, am I even allowed to print a copy or copies of .pdf format books I buy?  Obviously I'm aware that I'm not allowed to run one off and sell or give them away to all my friends, but am I even technically allowed to print a copy for my own use?<br/><br/>Secondly, the big them I'm wondering, is why do some authors choose not to release their books in .pdf format at all?  I find having really big, long books (more than, i dunno 80 pages or so) in .pdf to be pretty unweildy and annoying, both to read on the computer and for printing.  Smaller stuff isn't too bad though, and the price break for .pdf books, plus being able to have it INSTANTLY makes them fairly appealing.  It would seem to my inexperienced mind that they'd be good for the author too, since once her time has been paid for (and, i suppose, the potential cost of a server to host the files, if necessary) a .pdf sale is pure profit.  So why do some people not make use of that avenue?  Is it concerns over people sharing/pirating/etc.?  Or something else I haven't considered?<br/><br/>anyway, i've just been curious.  if anyone can help enlighten me, that would be sweet.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zenten" title="zenten"><img alt="zenten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zenten">zenten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158410/#Comment_158410" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T13:23:25+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  1:23PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite><br/>Secondly, the big them I'm wondering, is why do some authors choose not to release their books in .pdf format at all?

So sometimes they don't do it with some books because they just don't think it would be worth the manpower required.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158421/#Comment_158421" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T14:33:48+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  2:33PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, that makes sense.

I'm guessing that most authors/designers/publishers know I am probably going to do this and have no problem with it, but unless there is a different kind of license or something going on, i'm thinking from a strictly legalistic point of view under normal copyright law I may not be able to.

It seems like such a popular thing to do, and when I express my seething abhorrence of the process, most people just kinda shrug.  Seriously, it's archaic, and it mucks with my psychology in a terrible way.

All of my printed RPGs were bought at my local gaming stores, and so were in my hand the moment I paid for them.  I own a couple games that I loved so much as PDFs that I bought additional hard copies.<br/><br/>There are innumerable games that I would like to buy, but are only available in hardcopy through mail order.  <b>I will not buy them</b>, and we both lose.  I know it's irrational, but it's so much easier on my psyche, and it's my choice as a consumer.  If you insist on forcing me to wait for a hardcopy, at least give (or sell) me a PDF to tide me over in the meantime (I'm looking at you, Reign and Universalis)!<br/><br/>In summary: for me,  PDF == purchase.  Further, PDF also often means "impulse buy!"                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158555/#Comment_158555" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T09:17:42+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  9:17AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2008 9:19AM by Josh Roby.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back when I was starting, I didn't offer a PDF version of <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> because I was worried that I'd get stuck with all the hard copies that I had printed.

I've only paid for one .pdf, and it was a game I'll probably never play; I bought it because it bore some striking similarities to a game I was working on, and I wanted to see what it did. <br/><br/>I'll confess to having (illicit) digital copies of several D&amp;D books. I only own 3 D&amp;D books hardcopy, which, incidentally are the ones I use digitally most often. If they're purposefully made digital books, with bookmarks and indices and everything, they're much easier to use than hardcopy books in some instances. In one case, I've cut part of one digital book out to create another PDF (it's the introductory module in the back of the Eberron Campaign Setting) which I've marked up with sticky notes of monster stats, XP values, etc. As I abhor writing in hardcopy books, this is a definite bonus. <br/><br/>When it comes to indie games, I'd never download an illegal .pdf, whereas I've no problem doing it with big-name books. (my digital intellectual property ethics are selective) If I can find one made available for free by the author, I'll get it though, like the copy of Paladin I found buried on CRN games some time ago.<br/><br/>If I ever manage to get enough playtesting in to consider one of my games complete, I will probably offer digital copies for free with hardcopy purchases, or for very cheap by themselves (just because *I* dislike buying digital books doesn't mean I wouldn't take the opportunity to sell them to people who *don't* have a problem with it). I might even offer a "stripped down" version for free (though I've noticed that stripped down, no art, no examples, no in-depth explanations digital versions work better for quick rules reference).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158630/#Comment_158630" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T12:43:13+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 12:43PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>from a legal standpoint, am I even allowed to print a copy or copies of .pdf format books I buy?</blockquote>I didn't see someone directly address this question, but the answer is self-evident:<br/>If the PDF allows you to print itself, they don't mind. PDF format has a means of "locking out" the option to print.<br/><br/>So, for instance, when I offer GLASS, I'll have a free, printable <i>shotGLASS</i> PDF which is like Wolfe's "stripped down" version of the full GLASS book, which is meant for players to quick reference and is not very "user friendly" for defining a game type or creating custom Templates and Packages.<br/><br/>The full GLASS book--art, examples, design notes, GM advice, genres ready-to-run--will probably never be offered as a PDF; and if I do offer it in that format--I also like the "Free PDF Version with Book Purchase" deal; maybe only for the direct-sales hardback buyers?--it won't be printable.<br/><br/>In fact, a good trick for anti-piracy of PDFs (though time consuming) is to make each one you sell have a unique password just to be opened, which can't be modified. Then, if you see it show up online, it will have to come with a note/post/whatever telling the password to open... and you've busted the perp; you'd have a clear paper trail to the original buyer who made it publicly available. Not much of a stick, as the damages would be hard to prove in court and harder to collect from some individual who may be in another country... but you could at least give folks pause, and have a way to let the public shame them if you "leaked" the original source of the piracy on message boards and so forth.<br/><br/>Hope this helps;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158632/#Comment_158632" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T12:47:15+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 12:47PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, when you sell to Joe Grisham, make the password, "mynameisjoegrisham."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158635/#Comment_158635" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T13:00:57+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  1:00PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good idea... wonder if that can be automated somehow, with a server-based PDF generator (or, really, PDF tagger) attached to your shopping cart system.<br/><br/>Someone get Lulu on the phone and make this an option! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158641/#Comment_158641" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T13:27:41+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  1:27PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>If the PDF allows you to print itself, they don't mind.

I'm kinda weird.  See I know that no one is going to sue me or have me arrested for printing a legally purchased .pdf, but yeah.  I'm weird.  I get a little hung up on details.  I like to know when I'm doing things that are illegal, even if they're those things that are Technically-Illegal-But-You'll-Never-Get-In-Trouble-For-It.<br/><br/>I used to know more about copyright law, but I've forgotten most of it.  I seem to think there used to be some part of it that allowed people to make a copy of something they purchased legally as a backup in case the original was lost.  But I might be misremembering, and it might have changed, and hell, I dunno.  So I'm half convinced that I'm probably not technically allowed to print .pdfs that I buy.

It is then trivial to save an unprotected copy of any document for which you have the open password.<br/><br/>The only way to protect against copying of PDF files is with a DRM framework\u2014and even that isn't foolproof. Though I haven't looked, I strongly suspect that there are tools out there to strip DRM from a PDF; it should be significantly easier to do so than to strip iTunes' DRM, which has been done several times for different versions of iTunes. Adobe doesn't make money directly from sales of DRM'd PDFs, so there's no real incentive for them to engage in an arms race with the crackers, as Apple has.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158705/#Comment_158705" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T18:13:41+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  6:13PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2008 6:13PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Metal Fatigue</cite>I strongly suspect that there are tools out there to strip DRM from a PDF</blockquote>\nYes, there are.

The DMCA bans (among other things) distributing copyrighted material (PDF games) or pieces thereof (a character sheet) by means of using hardware (a printer) to circumvent the protection (explicitly including digital file type, attempting to prevent people from copying a proprietary format to an easily distributable format like mp3 to distribute), unless explicitly authorized. <br/><br/>Most people don't put an explicit authorization anywhere, because people assume that other people are not stupid, and they are right. It is the law that is stupid.<br/><br/>The potential ban on playing the game comes from the fact that playing a RPG is a lot more like a performance than, say, playing a DVD. It's never been tested, though.<br/><br/>You can make copies for your own use, unless a license you agree to says you may not (normally it does on things like software and sometimes on music - read the fine print on your CDs sometime) but you may not <i>distribute</i> them. <br/><br/>If I print out a game and I hand it to my wife to read, I have violated the law just as surely as if I bittorrented it to her. It is not unviolated if she hands it back to me any more than if she deletes the torrented file.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158709/#Comment_158709" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T18:50:23+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  6:50PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh yeah.  good ol' DMCA.  now the research i did for that comp 1 paper a few years back is coming back to me.  and pissing me off.  shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158716/#Comment_158716" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T19:23:55+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  7:23PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Authors and companies may not mind but you are absolutely right, whether they mind or not is not the issue.</blockquote>\nI would argue that it is.

The DMCA bans (among other things) distributing copyrighted material (PDF games) or pieces thereof (a character sheet) by means of using hardware (a printer) to circumvent the protection (explicitly including digital file type, attempting to prevent people from copying a proprietary format to an easily distributable format like mp3 to distribute), unless explicitly authorized.</blockquote>\nUmm... I don't believe the DMCA applies here.  To quote from the DMCA:\n<blockquote>Sec. 1201. Circumvention of copyright protection systems<br/><br/>`(a) VIOLATIONS REGARDING CIRCUMVENTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL MEASURES- (1)(A) No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.</blockquote>\nThen, later on:\n<blockquote>(3) As used in this subsection--<br/>`(A) to `circumvent a technological measure' means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner; and<br/>`(B) a technological measure `effectively controls access to a work' if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work.</blockquote>\nNow, typical PDFs are not encrypted, and do not bar printing.  Thus, in printing one, you are not "circumventing a technological measure" as the DMCA defines it.  Further, unless your PDF is password-protected, it does not "effectively control access to a work" as per part B, since no application of information or process or treatment is required to gain access to the work.  (Another example of an effective control would be the need to "authorize" a computer to play a song downloaded from iTunes.  Using a process to transform the file into an MP3 would violate the DMCA, because it disables that "effective control".  For a file that has no such protections, however, such as an unencrypted, non-password-protected PDF, turning the file into another format doesn't disable any "effective control" and thus isn't a violation.)<br/><br/>The DMCA doesn't cover just <i>anything</i> that's published electronically.  The publisher has to make some effort to protect the work.  Now, if the PDF doesn't allow printing without a specific password, and you used some process to print it without that password, that would violate the DMCA.  But simply printing a PDF that has no protection isn't a violation, as the law is written.<br/><br/>(Now, since laws can be extended through precedents established by court decisions, it's possible that the DMCA has been extended to cover such things.  But the text of the DMCA does not make them illegal.)<br/><br/>(Edited to change "standard PDFs are not encrypted" to "typical PDFs are not encrypted", which is closer to what I mean, before someone says, "but the standard allows for encryption, so encrypted PDFs are 'standard'....")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159384/#Comment_159384" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T09:47:52+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  9:47AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>If the PDF allows you to print itself, they don't mind.

Do you think they also have to SAY "it's OK to print" when that mechanism is expressly programmed into PDF format for the purpose of protecting against printing?<br/><br/>Uh, OK, I guess... but I wouldn't lose a second of sleep at night if I printed something that COULD be lock, but wasn't, against the unspecified (i.e. assumed) wishes of the producer--too bad, so sad, learn your business. In a way, it's no "worse" than the (legal) archival copy of software one may make to guard against media loss or damage. Just in reverse. That said, I wouldn't duplicate it for others; that's clearly presumed to be "bad," if the producer charges for the PDF. And for what it's worth, if the company doesn't even offer a print version, they can not claim any sort of loss or damages, by you printing for personal use.<br/><br/>In short: you worry too much. You paid them, they got no print offer, you aren't going to go into business making bootlegs... go print a damned copy, already, and PLAY!<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>And to clarify for folks RE passwords on PDF: there's TWO: one to open, and one to change security settings. They are rarely the same (obviously). The security setting, then, control whether or not one can print or change the document (and at what resolution, or in what ways).<br/><br/>All that said, sure, a cracker can bypass them both and make it freely available on a pirate site. My only point about using PWs above was that such a Password to Open would make it hard for casual distribution--you know, every Tom, Dick, and Harry being able to toss it up on some Geocities site without fear of repercussions. These "minor players" knowing that they would have to reveal their personal, name-associated Password to Open would slow them down or stop them. But, no, not the crackers who make an actual effort to bypass the document's security.<br/><br/>And PDF does use two kinds of DRM: Certificate-based Security and Adobe LiveCycle Policy Server. Might require a net connection to open, in those case, but would be much harder to bypass (if not impossible--haven't investigated them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159387/#Comment_159387" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T09:59:22+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  9:59AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course it has to be pointed out that not every bit of PDF producing software has the ability to print lock or password protect a PDF file, and not every PDF author has the ability to do that, by virtue of not having the software.

Laws and their interpretations are also subject to change over time.  Thus, this is going to be peppered liberally with "in general" and similar phrases.<br/><br/>In general, though, making copies of a work that you legitimately own a copy of, for your own personal use, is considered to be a legitimate use.  In some cases, it may be considered legal even if you merely have access to the work, but don't own it (e.g., videotaping a program on TV to watch it later).  Thus, if you print out a game you own the PDF of so you can read it away from the computer, that's generally considered a legitimate use.  (I say "legitimate" rather than "legal" because it may be considered to violate the letter of the law, but it's established enough in common law that a judge or jury would be likely to let you off, if someone tried to prosecute.)<br/><br/>So, the "very legalistic standpoint" for this depends on whether you're concerned about the letter of the law, or how the law is likely to actually be applied in practice.  (And, of course, on the jurisdiction you're in!)<br/><br/>Making copies and distributing them without permission, however, is not generally legal.  There are specific exceptions codified in US law as "fair use", but they're fairly narrow, and they're subject to interpretation by a judge and jury.  In other words, don't bet on "fair use" without a lawyer's advice on your specific case.  Thus, if you print out a game you own the PDF of and hand out copies to your play group, you're most likely violating the law.  <br/><br/>Now, if the PDF says "you may not make copies of this", but it isn't locked from printing... well, that's a grey area right now.  Traditionally, a restriction like that wouldn't be considered valid, as it wasn't presented to you before you bought the product, and you didn't sign anything agreeing to it.  However, software makers have been pushing very hard to get "shrinkwrap licenses" accepted as legal, and that has had some impact on the legal environment.  Back in the 1800s, book publishers tried to put all sorts of restrictions as "licenses" in their books -- for example, that you couldn't sell the book to someone else.  Those were struck down back then, leading to the formation of such concepts as "the right of first sale" (i.e., that once you've bought the book, it's yours to do with as you please, including selling it, giving it away, etc.).  However, things are happening somewhat differently with shrinkwrap licenses, for many reasons, and we're likely going to see some of that bleeding into the book end through electronic books.<br/><br/>And that's the situation pretty much as it currently stands in the US.  Remember, though, that no question is ever finally settled in the law -- laws can be changed and can be reinterpreted.  In the end, remember what Lao Tzu wrote -- "Law is the empty husk of loyalty and good faith."  Act with those, and you should never find a publisher taking you to court.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159594/#Comment_159594" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T16:43:13+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  4:43PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll just summarize by saying I think it's completely obvious that requiring someone to use a PDF reader "effectively controls access to a work" since in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work.

By opening the box you agree to the license, which you can't even read without opening the box.<br/><br/>Now this may seem completely unfair and bizarre, but there are actually contracts like this which courts will enforce, they are called "contracts of adhesion".  But as you might imagine, there are big restrictions on them, which a lot of software giants were basically ignoring until they got their hand slapped.<br/><br/>These days software companies typically rely on click-through licensing, you know, that super-fine print box that pops up when you install something.<br/><br/>What I find interesting about the whole "license" angle is that it's not really clear to me what exactly software developers think it's going to accomplish for their company.  I assume somebody somewhere got half-assed advice from their lawyer to do things a particular way and that's how things ended up being.  But personal computers haven't been around long enough for the law to be perfectly comfortable and pleasant with them, like we are with say, wills.

Ordinary copyright law prohibits the distribution of MP3s of songs without permission of the copyright holder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159672/#Comment_159672" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T20:10:49+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  8:10PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>So the Amazon digital music store is illegal?</blockquote>\nNo, there are explicit permissions given to Amazon (and probably to customers!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7121/questions-about-pdf-file-game-books" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7121/questions-about-pdf-file-game-books" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7121/questions-about-pdf-file-game-books/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7121%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7121%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
