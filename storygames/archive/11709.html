Here's what I wrote in FB:<br/><br/>I enjoyed listening to this Canon Puncture on the Primetime Adventures pitch session, but I did feel constantly like I wanted to be part of the conversation. To me, the pitch has never seemed like this awful bugaboo most people make it out to be. And I have had people show up and ruin the game (someone who hated TV, an...other guy who had "say something now" flopsweat but who was otherwise cool), but I've run the game dozens of times (no exaggeration) at cons and found the hit rate to be very high, and the pitch to be one of my favorite parts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
