At the same time, ancestors have to compete against each other for resources, as only those who are remembered and honored by the tribe have power in the spirit realm.<br/><br/>I have no concrete stuff yet, but I have some ideas:<br/><br/>There is no GM.<br/><br/>The game starts with a sort of introductory scene for each player, where you play through the heroic death that caused the tribe to revere you as an ancestor and allowed you to linger on in the spirit realm.<br/><br/>Ancestors are completely invisible to the tribe, but they can make their presence known through natural phenomena, small miracles, dreams and through the tribe shaman.<br/><br/>All players are required to contribute a certain number of tribesmen. More will be added through play, as they are needed. These are real people with real lives, and their relationships with each other are crucial to the tribes survival. The ancestors can influence the lives and relationships of the tribesmen, in order to help the tribe grow and prosper.<br/>The game takes place over generations, so players get to watch families they have invested time and effort in grow or wither as time passes. I want real emotional investment here.<br/><br/>The tribe makes discoveries and inventions through the game, which change their lives (Im envisioning "progress cards" here). Ancestors are able to influence this, and can provide special supernatural discoveries and inventions through their powers.<br/><br/>Ancestors compete for resources in the form of reverance and rememberance from the tribesmen. They cannot interact with each other, however, beyond talking.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110393/#Comment_110393" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T12:25:31+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 12:25PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2007 12:28PM by Ron Hammack.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have any criticism for the idea unless "it's too awesome!" counts.<br/><br/>What I'm really curious about is how you plan to accomplish this...\n<blockquote>The game takes place over generations, so players get to watch families they have invested time and effort in grow or wither as time passes. I want real emotional investment here.</blockquote>\nSo I'm a player in this game. I've contributed some tribesmen and now I'm influencing them, investing time and effort into families, and watching them grow or wither while competing with the other players for reverence and remembrance. But <i>who decides</i> whether they grow or wither? <br/><br/>* Is it the other players? Can someone say "Ha! Your family's matriarch slips into a deep depression after her favorite daughter dies in childbirth. Without her firm spiritual guidance, the rest of the family gets absorbed in their daily lives and neglects your ancestral shrine."? If that's the case, what keeps me focused on the tribesmen as real people that I'm emotionally invested in, rather than just seeing them as my ancestor's "hit points"?<br/><br/>* Is it me? If I get to decide whether my family thrives or withers, that kind of negates the whole (very good) idea of only being able to <i>influence</i> them.<br/><br/>* Is it game mechanics? If my attempt to influence my tribesmen for the better is a mechanical contest, where they become happier and more prosperous if I succeed then, again, what's in the system to remind me that they're real people that I care about, and not just my ancestor's "experience points"?<br/><br/>So to distill that down a bit, here's the problem I see: <br/><br/>In order for the tribespeople to feel like real people, they should be portrayed by real people. But if they're portrayed by <i>me</i> then I'm missing out on the "you can only influence them indirectly" vibe and if they're portrayed by <i>another player</i> they run the risk of just becoming pawns in the "compete for reverence" game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110394/#Comment_110394" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T12:26:49+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 12:26PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2007 12:27PM by Ron Hammack.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            edit: sorry, double post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110437/#Comment_110437" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T14:34:12+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  2:34PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>In order for the tribespeople to feel like real people, they should be portrayed by real people.

That way, when another (technically competing) player controls the tribesman, that player has some clearly defined boundaries to play the tribesman within, which are defined by the player "owning" the tribesman.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
