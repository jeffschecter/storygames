But do you have what it takes to be a FAST roleplaying game designer? Do you love games but hate spending time making them?! Do you want to earn the adoration of people on this board who enjoy games and game-related ideas?!<br/>Do you have six minutes and five seconds to spare? <br/><br/><b>The Contest</b>: Produce a finished RPG in 365 seconds (six minutes, five seconds)<br/><br/><b>The Requirements</b>: During the contest period you must produce a concept and a design. You may not use any previous writing, but go ahead and use ideas you\u2019ve been kicking around. If you have time for editing, layout, or play-testing, you may have super-speed, and should use it to become a superhero.<br/><br/><b>The Deadline</b>: You only have SIX MINUTES AND FIVE SECONDS from the second you start. Start as soon as you finish reading this post, or any other time you want, but don\u2019t cheat by mulling over ideas first.<br/><br/><b>The Prize</b>: Your prize is an incomplete game! However, it will probably have some awesome ideas and you\u2019ll have made something! In addition, you'll earn the approval and admiration of some people, probably. I\u2019ll think you\u2019re cool, at least. <br/>Best of all, should you complete the contest and meet your deadline, you will be awarded a pile of self respect and a feeling of accomplishment so great, so massive and enormous in its magnitude, that all those viewing it and by extension you will be forced to utter: man, that is one awesome person!<br/><br/><b>Meet The Judges</b>: Look at your screen. There you will see names. Those names are people who might read your game. There\u2019s no formal judging but we\u2019ll all know who the winner will be. <br/><br/><b>Entry Fee</b>: Six minutes and five seconds of your time. <br/><br/>*Note: This is only sort of an April Fools.

The title should thus be interpreted as "a thief who uses guns," and not "a thief of guns," though take it either way you want, I guess.<br/><br/>There are three players in Gun Thief: The Gun Thief, The Law and The Jagged Beautiful Women.<br/><br/><b>The Gun Thief</b><br/><br/>Right, pick five of the following: gun, gun, gun, blunt instrument, buddy, buddy, woman, camero, chopper, mask, stash of drugs, money, money.<br/>Affix one of the following tags to each: trustworthy, one ugly motherfucker of a, brokedown, brokedown, brokedown, tainted, tainted, last-chance, glorious, devil.<br/>Pick a badass name, or a hardened-over-the-years name, or an ugly name.<br/><br/><i>Example: I took a trustworthy gun, one ugly motherfucker of a gun, a tainted buddy, a last-chance woman and a devil camero. The name's Aspen.</i><br/><br/><b>The Law</b><br/><br/>Make things awful, right out of the gate. In media res the shit out of 'im, or just stick him with an ugly predicament.<br/>Say that he's fifty in debt to a fella named Horse, for example.<br/>Say that Jenna's going cowgirl on him while Indie's taking all his stuff, but he's too fucked on bad coke to sort it all out, for example.<br/><br/><b>The Gun Thief</b><br/><br/>You get three of these things: keeping all your items, gaining a new item, get the girl, get what you came for, get out unharmed.<br/>You can alternately pick only one, but have it be a permanent gain, lose everything else, and ride off into the sunset.<br/><br/><b>The Jagged Beautiful Women</b><br/><br/>There are going to be jagged beautiful women everywhere.<br/>Breathe life into them.<br/>Make it hard not to pick "get the girl" in every sticky situation the gun thief wanders into.<br/><br/>When he gets the girl, give her up.<br/>Frame a scene, or a moment, and make it ooze with sweat and rush and make him powerful.<br/><br/>And then, as soon as possible, take that jagged beautiful woman back away from him.<br/>Never let him keep the things that make him happy.<br/>Make him fuck up his life to get a second taste.<br/>Or make the second taste pathetically hollow, so that he goes looking elsewhere for his tastes.<br/><br/>Oh, and if he takes a woman as one of his five starting things, work like hell to break that relationship down.<br/>If he has a lady, and calls that lady his own, constantly be offering up sexy desire magnets, constantly be getting under that woman's skin, constantly be trying to derail his life so that you can get back in.<br/><br/><b>The Law</b><br/><br/>So, like, the moment that shit's in line, offer more problems.<br/>Involve police, and gangsters, and guys who think they're heroes, and drug lords, and ugly cowboys.<br/>Make it impossible for the gun thief to be a good person.<br/><br/>It's fine to say "so, now you're robbing a convenience store, and the guy pulls a gun on you", even if the Gun Thief didn't say he had plans to rob a convenience store.<br/>The law dictates the problems, the gun thief chooses 3 of 5 things, and the jagged beautiful women come to life and try to lure him into lusty, dangerous places.<br/><br/><b>The End</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265070/#Comment_265070" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T22:46:19+00:00" title="April  1, 2010 10:46PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>In Transit</b><br/><br/>This game is inspired by those awesome BMW short films ("The Hire") featuring the Driver (Clive Owen) and the general concept behind <i>The Transporter</i> films, though not the sub-par quality of them.<br/><br/>One player is the Driver and picks a Hotwheels car to represent their vehicle.<br/><br/>Another player plays the GM.<br/><br/>Together, the player and GM negotiate how many playing cards to lay out to represent the journey to the destination where "the package" needs to be delivered.  A short, quick game chase could be played with a dozen (or even fewer) cards.  A longer game might be 30 cards or string multiple chases or deliveries together.<br/><br/>Decide what the package and destination are. Roleplay out the hire and the Driver starting up his car and beginning the journey.<br/><br/>Place the agreed upon number of cards in a curving path across the table, representing the road from here to the destination.  These cards should be played face up.<br/><br/>The Driver places his Hotwheels car on the first card and moves it forward one card at a time.<br/><br/>- Cards with values of 5 or below the Driver can just drive right over.  The GM can describe the open road.<br/>- Cards with values higher than 7 require the Driver to draw a card from the deck and attempt to overcome them.  The GM should describe the difficulty.<br/>- If the Driver's draw exceeds the value of the challenge, the Driver describes how he easily maneuvers around the difficulty<br/>- If the Driver's draw does not equal or exceed the value of the challenge, the GM describes the failure but the Driver continues on, with the car taking the brunt of the damage. The GM describes how everything is going to shit.<br/>- If the Driver hits a face card, he cannot go through the challenge but has to go around it.  Begin offroading.<br/><br/>To offroad, begin playing cards face-down off the side of the path, maneuvering around the face card until you can get back on the road.  Flip over the challenges for off-roading one card at a time, treating them as normal.  Yes, you sometimes have to offroad from your offroad.<br/><br/>For enhanced fun, add other cars (played by other players?) who are trying to catch the Driver.  I'm not sure how.<br/><br/>With more/better rules and playtesting this game could be a lot better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265073/#Comment_265073" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T23:08:53+00:00" title="April  1, 2010 11:08PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jonathan,<br/><br/>You've just added minis to Ribbon Drive.<br/>Congrats.<br/><br/>JK!

I start...*adjusts the second clock*...now.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst the concept. Ok, this is going to be about anime girls with huge swords that destroy everything from their way. They're fighting....demons. Sounds like Claymore, hum.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe characters have three stats: burst, solo and dual. Burst lets you kill hordes of small demons, with solo you attack a single demon at a time and dual lets you fight two demons. With burst you use d4, with dual d6 and with a solo d10. When you attack, you roll your die, the demon(s) roll whatever their stat is. If your stat is bigger than their, you do damage, which you describe vividly. If you miss, the demons do damage. After 3 damage, either you or the demon is dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nJesus, that didn't turn out very coherent. Nice experiment, though. I left all the typos intact, for proofreading should have been part of those 36s seconds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265084/#Comment_265084" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T04:57:14+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  4:57AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2010 4:27AM by Teataine.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No idea what this is.<br/><br/><b>MAGNETIC ANIMALS</b><br/>For this game you're going to need:<br/>-a GM plus 1-5 players<br/>-a working, running clock on which you can easily change the time it shows<br/>-a bag with three white and three black stones or three coins or three dice or yarrow sticks (I-Ching)<br/><br/><b>PLAYERS</b><br/>Write down your name.<br/><br/>You have 77 minutes to save the world, but all you have with you is:<br/>(pick one from each list, two players can't pick the same object)<br/><br/>Left pocket: <br/><i>torn pages from a library copy of Magic Without Tears by Alistair Crowley, photocopies of spells in the AD&amp;D spellbook, a notepad with dozens of clumsily copied sigils from Simon's Necronomicon, a children's Bible with lots of pictures, a tattered paperback of The Western Lands by William S.

Demons, vampires, werewolves, all that shit.<br/><br/>You hunt monsters. Hunting monsters is awesome because you get to drive around in a cool car with a bunch of guns in the trunk and <i>fight evil</i>. It sucks because you're basically homeless, you've seen friends and family killed in horrible ways, and no matter how many monsters you kill, there's always more. So you're kind of fucked up.<br/><br/>You need a bunch of index cards and a handful of change. Pregame setup is writing, say, 10 useful facts about monsters (like "sunlight kills vampires" or whatever) on the index cards. All of these things are indisputable parts of the game's lore.<br/><br/>Your stats are Monster Killing, Lore Research, Street Smarts, and Smooth Moves. Divide 9 points among your stats. <br/>Pick one thing you're really good at, other than killing monsters. <br/>Write down the one thing you miss the most about your normal, pre-monster-killing life. You don't do anything with this, it just sits there in the middle of your character sheet reminding you of what you've had to give up.<br/>Your Fucked Up score starts at 1. Decide what you're fucked up about.<br/><br/>To do stuff, toss coins equal to your stat. Heads are good, tails are bad. You succeed if you have more good than bad. You can take away bad coins by raising your Fucked Up score. <br/><br/>When you throw Killing Monsters, you get to add one good coin for every established monster fact you work into your description of your monster killing scene.<br/><br/>When you throw Lore Research, you get to make up one more monster fact for every good coin.<br/><br/>The GM will hit you with life challenges, like "you're out of money for gas and ammo". You throw Street Smarts to overcome those.<br/><br/>The more Fucked Up you are, the more the GM gets to screw with your character.<br/><br/>I don't know what Smooth Moves do yet.<br/><br/>My cigarette's done, so I'm calling that 6 minutes and some change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265258/#Comment_265258" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T19:08:07+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  7:08PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron,<br/>\n<br/>\nFinish it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam and Dean need you to finish it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265259/#Comment_265259" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T19:26:50+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  7:26PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe,<br><br>You just proved Luke Crane wrong.

FoE are limited to either a time or a space, but they are hard to destroy.<br/><br/>Everyone plays a Real Soldier and a force of Entropy. Each character has 9 d6's to split between their three things. <br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, create a pool of characters, both Real Soldiers and Forces of Entropy.<br/><br/>Each session of play, each player picks one Soldier and one FoE. Starting with the oldest player, frame scenes that either concern their FoE destroying reality, or their Soldier preventing one of the other FoE from taking some entropic action. Each session will only concern one FoE, and every other player will play their Soldier.<br/><br/>During a scene, roll your pool for whatever's relevant to your action. 4+ are successes, most successes wins. For every successful roll a FoE has, it gains a bonus die to its pool.

He/she sometimes whispers things to player two and three; it doesn't matter what, and it will have no effect on their actions, but player one <i>doesn't know that</i>.<br/><br/>At some point, player four should start whispering to player one. The whispers should be about how player one should feel. Things like: "You are angry at these two for fighting".

The Finnish small town restaurant is not a night club, it's clientele is a snapshot of society, normal people. The height of iniquity in these circles is drinking too much and too consistently, dying of a failed liver later on.<br/><br/>Each player character has Abilities for Cooking, Patter, Bouncing and Attention. You use Cooking to make foods (and complex drinks), Patter to service people (including at the bar), Bouncing to keep the crowd happy and in line, and Attention to do any niggly attention-requiring tasks, such as cleaning the place up after the night. All Abilities are dice pools, something like ten dice between them. Having a zero in something means that you're the sort of wreck who works in these places, completely unable to do the thing indicated.<br/><br/>One player plays the Crowd. He gets a bunch of dice, each representing a customer. Whenever he rolls a bunch of dice on the table, leave them wherever they are: those customers just got into the restaurant. The customers want stuff; you can point to individual dice and describe what the people do. Also move the dice around to depict action. To succeed in servicing a customer or repairing something they cause, win the die value with a dice roll. Reroll any customers who are beaten, now they want something else. A customer leaves once he's drunk or has paired with another customer of different gender. If a customer leaves but has left something behind, keep the die somewhere the track the target number for fixing whatever it was.<br/><br/>Each won customer-service brings one chip to the restaurant. A chip can be spent to improve a dice result by one point.<br/><br/>The game is won if the restaurant is still standing and profitable at the end of the night, after clean-up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265323/#Comment_265323" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-03T10:26:07+00:00" title="April  3, 2010 10:26AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2010 10:26AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am, of course, writing this in the back office of the restaurant on a Saturday night.

I don't understand this bit: "If you don't, you have to let one of the organisations noted above fuck up your life in some way to overcome it."</blockquote>\nIt means that the organization in question requires something in payment for taking care of it, essentially. For example, you have to call in your CIA buddies from years back, the ones you ditched by faking your own death. So now they know that you're alive, and it's sure to fuck up your life. Or you simply promise half of your next paycheck to WWF if they'll just come take the whale away. I like how very, very likely it is that the player has to do a compromise like this (and note that there is technically some leeway in negotiating the price and playing the orgs against one another), and how the only other alternative is going crazy with psychic powers on the problem. Ludicrous.<br/><br/>Also, let's try for a longer post this time around, my ADHD caused by the adrenaline rush is getting ridiculous.<br/><br/>I liked <i>Gun Thief</i> and <i>Magnetic Animals</i> (brilliant pocket options!), even if the latter cheated on editing. Those and NEDL are my top picks at this point, although every other game has good points, too. It really does things to my critical machinery to remember that these are written in six minutes; can't exactly get very demanding.

Not even if you think they're almost done and you've just GOT to get this word in before anyone else and you're JUST overlapping your first syllable with their last. Just DON'T.<br/><br/>Second rule: Limit the time that you say something. Other people are waiting, DESPERATELY, perhaps, to say something in return. Let them. Say one or two sentences, and that's IT. If your character is speaking dialogue, then you get THREE sentences.<br/><br/>Third rule: If it's said, it happened. The story proceeds, and it waits for no one ti mull over their options, or think of the best way to say it, or to go back and revise because they didn't say it right. If it comes out your mouth, it happened. Deal with it.<br/><br/>So, the exceptions: you get two totems: a 3-minute hourglass timer, and a pencil. One of each for the whole table. If you want to talk for longer than 1-2 sentences, pick up the timer and turn it over. You get that long to speak uninterrupted. You CAN'T USE THE TIMER AGAIN UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE HAS TAKEN A TURN WITH IT.<br/><br/>If you wanna say something not part of the story, hold up the pencil. You don't have to limit to just -12 sentences in this case, but don't go on forever. You're breaking game flow, so save it for something important. If someone else wants to get on with things, they can pick up the timer and turn it over. This does NOT count as their use of the timer.

Also, occasionally ask "What obstacles are between them and the person they want to kill?" Also remember, shooting people to solve all your problems has consequences.

Fuck that in the ear, I'm gonna go content-first this time:<br/><br/><b>Bastard Memoir</b><br/><br/>You are a man of greatness. Destined to live a daring life of adventure, fame or power. Charismatic, decisive, brilliant, you stride the land like a giant, and it is only fitting that such exploits should be chronicled by...YOU.<br/><br/>After all, who else could?<br/><br/>SO: One player portrays the "great man" who is writing his autobiographical account of a scientific expedition, political campaign, or other daring media stunt. This player is the Bastard.<br/><br/>Everyone else plays his aides, assistants, family members, and other people in his orbit.<br/><br/>The Bastard sets a scene, declaring location, location, what he is trying to accomplish, and who is there with him. The others all give short descriptions of what they are doing to assist (or not) the Bastard.<br/><br/>The Bastard then narrates, in High Autobiographical Style, the beginning of the scene, including the actions of others based on their opening descriptions. The Bastard is callous, cruel, selfish, petulant, pompous, and abusive, but spins his actions in the most sympathetic and morally superior light possible.<br/><br/>When you, the Bastard, have reached a point where all the others' descriptions have been brought into play (and the Bastard's reactions to them), stop. Let the others describe new actions based on what's happened and how the Bastard has treated them. Go on until the scene fees done, then give one final narration, giving a cutoff-type hand signal to declare SCENE OVER. Don't go more than 3 cycles before calling OVER.<br/><br/>Keep going until the climactic scene of the expedition/campaign/stunt. This scene plays out like all the others, but will determine success/failure of the endeavor.<br/><br/>Then play out a denoument scene. The final disposition and fate of the Bastard and the Others will be revealed. This plays like all scenes, except that any Other who has renounced or abandoned the Bastard will have their own Denoument scene without any Bastard input. Multiple Others who qualify for separate Denoument can combine their Denouments if they wish.<br/><br/>THE END.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265487/#Comment_265487" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T16:04:03+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  4:04PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>HISTORY HAD IT COMING</b><br/><br/>At the end of the universe, one person is supposed to oversee the operation and kick-start the creation of the next one. There was a cock-up, and multiple people turned up. Fortunately, a necessary requirement for starting the new universe was access to time-travel technology, thus providing the means of clearing the matter up.<br/><br/><i>Basics</i><br/><br/>Each player takes the role of one of the candidates. Character prep consists of writing, on an index card, how that character came to invent or come into possession of time travel technology (TTT).<br/><br/>At the start of the game, reveal these cards and place them in front of you.<br/><br/><i>The Game</i><br/><br/>Take it in turns to start a scene by describing when and where you are going. Your goal is to scrub one or more of the other characters by preventing them from gaining access to TTT. Every character is in every scene- naturally.<br/><br/>Describe your actions, shouting across one another, etc, to reflect the real chaos that would ensue. Resolution is by means of 'spoken endurance'- that is, how long someone can argue their point without having to stop for breath.<br/><br/>When the scene is resolved, the winner writes up what happened on an index card and places it in the middle of the table.<br/><br/><i>Getting Scrubbed</i><br/>All player characters have 2 states- scrubbed and non-scrubbed. If you are scrubbed, you can start a scene to restore TTT to yourself. There is no penalty for currently being in a state of 'scrub'- TTT, remember? There are no paradoxes, just things that haven't already have happened yet.<br/><br/><i>Recursion</i><br/>Inevitably, play may suffer recursion. To represent different version of the same character being present, use hand puppets and funny voices.<br/><br/><i>Game End</i><br/>When only 1 character remains unscrubbed, he is declared the winner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265519/#Comment_265519" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T20:58:59+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  8:58PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2010 9:14PM by Wordman.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Kung Fu Mook</b><br/><br/>In a world where action movie-like situations are commonplace, you are one of the guys who gets anonymously beaten down by the hero time after time. You die. Often. But it doesn't matter. You just keep coming back, over and over again, often against the exact same hero 20 minutes later. Your life, such as it is, is a living hell. But there is a way out. All you have to do is anonymously kill the hero, any motherfucking hero, and eternal rest is yours.<br/><br/>To kill a Hero, you must:<ul><li>Remain anonymous.</li><li>You must roll in your Kill Range, which defaults to 12+.</li><li>The Hero must roll in his fail range, which defaults to 1.</li></ul>\n<b>The Mook</b><br/><br/>You have three things going for you:<br/><br/>Numbers: You fight with 2d12 comrades (rolled separately for each Fight Scene), all identical to you.<br/><br/>Anonymity: People rarely remember you. To Recognize you, they need to roll your Anonymity score or better on a d12. At the start of each movie, your Anonymity score starts at 12.<br/><br/>Disguise: Your face is usually concealed by something, and that something gives you an edge. In any Fight Scene, you choose one of the following:\n<ul><li>Visored Helmet: the helmet makes your harder to hurt, subtracting one from the Hero's roll.</li><li>Ninja hood: the hood makes you better able to sneak up on the Hero, adding one to your roll.</li><li>Mutated face: with your face transformed into a horrible creature, you are more dangerous and so, your kill range becomes 10+; however, the Hero is allowed to use more gratuitous violence against you, so adds 2 to his roll.</li><li>Natural face: with your natural face, you can Emote; however, the Hero has a chance to Recognize you.</li></ul>\n<b>The Hero</b><br/><br/>The hero has this going for him:<br/><br/>Destiny: The Hero is supposed to win. The longer the movie last, the more likely it is he or she will. The Hero adds their Destiny score to their roll. Destiny starts at 5.<br/><br/><b>Movies</b><br/><br/>A movie is a series of up five to Fight Scenes against the same Hero. Each time you fight, both you and the hero get a little better.<br/><br/><b>Fight Scene</b><br/><br/>If you are wearing your natural face, the Hero rolls a d12. If this roll equals or exceeds your Anonymity, you are Recognized. If you are Recognized, no matter what else happens in this scene, you cannot kill the Hero.<br/><br/>Both you and the Hero roll a d12. These rolls are modified as follows:<ul>\n<li>Your disguise changes the rolls as described.</li><li>If you Emote, you describe how your facial expression makes it more likely you kill the Hero, and you add 5 to your roll.</li><li>The Hero adds his Destiny to his roll.</li><li>For every three of your fellow mooks, reduce the Hero's roll by 1.</li></ul>\nIf you kill the hero, the game is over. Otherwise...<br/><br/>If the Hero has the higher roll, all the mooks die, including you, but the'll be back the next scene. Reduce your Anonymity score by 1. If you were Recognized in this scene, reduce it by an additional 2 (three total). The Hero's Destiny increases by 1.<br/><br/>If you have the higher roll, all the mooks die, including you, but the'll be back the next scene. You, however, made an impression on the Hero. Reduce your Anonymity by 2. If you were Recognized in this scene, reduce it by an additional 2 (four total). The Hero is a bit shaken, so does not gain any Destiny.<br/><br/>If the rolls are tied, the result is as if you won the roll, but the Hero's Destiny increases by 1.<br/><br/>I went over the time limit. <small>By like 20 minutes. <small>And the end result is a dice game.</small></small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265533/#Comment_265533" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T23:31:41+00:00" title="April  4, 2010 11:31PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite>Describe your actions, shouting across one another, etc, to reflect the real chaos that would ensue.

Like your result a lot? Explain how something that matters to you a lot is on the line, and roll another die. Now, you can distribute those dice between your goal and the thing that matters. <br/><br/>Thing that matters: 1-2, lost forever. 3-4, lost for now. 5-6, secure for now.<br/><br/>Or, put BOTH dice on the one thing. If those are two fives or 2 sixes, the thing is succeeded mightily or secure forever.<br/><br/>Yes, you can keep adding things that matter to the roll.<br/><br/><b>Things That Matter</b><br/>Write down five things that matter to you, or ten or twenty if you like.<br/><br/><b>Badass Level</b><br/>You begin as a badass.

place within 5 minutes. 5 minutes and 5 seconds, to be precise; set your watches NOW (reading this is included in the game). By the way: this game was conceived and written in less than that time.<br/><br/>4-9 players. Each player a pencil and a paper.<br/><br/><b>The 1-2-3 Method</b><br/><br/>1 - Make your characters: <br/>- first; a fictional name of our world<br/>- and then; 3 traits of our world (at least one of the traits must be <i>murderous</i> in some way). <br/>- First player to finish his character starts narrating, and will have his character as the sole survivor at the end of the game. It's not important that other players finish their characters completely, as they will all die anyway ...<br/><br/>2 - Set up situations rapidly, letting the first character meet the others one by one, or in twos. Let there be some conflict, and let it end by murder.<br/><br/>Try to make the scenes feed into eachother; like if the first scene has a murder (it has, of course), then the next scene is about how the murderer (the first charcter) spots a witness (another character), hunts it down, and kills it ... and the next scene can be about the detective ... etc.<br/><br/>3 - end it by 5 minutes and 5 seconds. An alarm would be nice.<br/><br/><b>Have a happy narration!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265900/#Comment_265900" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T03:32:03+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  3:32AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            12:26<br/><br/>Orcs<br/><br/>When you lose a conflict you get as many scars as you have opponents. Everyone has a rank within the pack, if you have a conflict with someone and the one with lower rank wins trade ranks. Add your scars to your stat in conflict resolution. Pass the pigs seems fine (add scars to total score). 2D6, snake eyes = lose all score, a 1 = this turn you get 0. Target number orcs agree on. You can assist someone, it's super good for winning bullying but doesn't get YOU anything so hope asshole holds his part of the deal or beat him up later.<br/><br/>The orc with the lowest rank finds items from time to time. Player decides what the item is and what it does. Taking an item from another orc is a conflict. Low level orcs find and fight over food and bones to gnaw on and high level orcs fight over kingdoms and black fortresses.<br/><br/>You are always in a war.<br/><br/>Example item:<br/><br/>Piece of food: eat before a conflict to gain +2<br/>Evil sword: get +1 in all conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265901/#Comment_265901" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T03:33:48+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  3:33AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Explanation: level has nothing to do with rank.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265968/#Comment_265968" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T12:34:27+00:00" title="April  7, 2010 12:34PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For John Ryan...New Earth Defense League<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_gIbUYpZGdnE/S7zdfIieRaI/AAAAAAAAAHI/Wb0de0bP2HQ/s1600/NEDL01.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265984/#Comment_265984" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T14:30:12+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  2:30PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ADVENTURE TIME PRIME<br/><br/>A universal story game<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>1. Collect 3-6 players, some index cards, writing materials, coins, and a timer. Sit at a table.<br/>2. Decide, by consensus, on a flavor for a game. This could be as general as "Lovecraftian horror" or as specific as "Das Boot". Don't get married to it yet, though.<br/>3. Each player gets two index cards. On each index card, write a name and three things that are true about a person that has that name. The game host collects these cards ("character cards") face up.<br/>4. Each player gets three index cards. On each index card, write a danger that you think could happen to a character in that flavor of game. The host collects these cards too ("danger cards") face down and shuffles them.<br/>5. Starting with the host and moving left, each player chooses a character card. You'll be primarily responsible for that character, but as you'll see, there's some sharing.<br/>6. Once everyone has a character, they add one fact to the card.<br/>7. The host deals a danger card to each player. Count to three and turn them over. Take five minutes, exactly, to figure out the initial situation, in which all the facts on the character cards, plus all the dangers, are true. Write down the initial situation, then take a short break. It is required to stand up and take at least one step away from the table at this time. Once everyone sits back down, play continues.<br/><br/>PLAY:<br/>During this part, one player will have the timer in front of him/her. That player is the "dealer" (the timer is the "button").<br/>1. Set the timer for one hour and put it in front of the host, making the host the first dealer. The host begins narrating from the initial situation.<br/>2. The dealer narrates until a crisis is reached - that is, a point at which a danger card currently in front of some player could be overcome. Anyone else can speak during the narration too, and if no one disagrees, whatever they say is true. If any player thinks the dealer has reached a crisis - a point at which a danger could be removed from a player - he/she should say "Are you sure?" and point to the card that can be removed. At that point, the crisis is deemed reached.<br/>3. CRISIS: The player to the dealer's left chooses a new danger card from those not currently in front of any player, and not removed from the game. The dealer flips three different coins. The one with the lowest value is the success coin. If it comes up heads, the danger central to the crisis is resolved and removed from play entirely. The middle value coin is the special coin. If one of the dealer's character card facts is relevant to the situation, as determined by majority vote, then the dealer can use that coin instead of the success coin or the failure coin - or both. The largest coin is the failure coin. If it comes up heads, the dealer gives the new danger card to any player, himself included, and then wraps up by explaining how that danger is now true.<br/>4. Pass the button left, and continue from 2, until the timer expires. When that happens, wrap up the current turn and then stop. Take a break, walking away from the table, continuing when everyone returns.<br/>5. Play for one more hour, starting with the player whose turn it was next. But now, the game can also end by consensus, when you're out of dangers, when every character is unplayable, or when no player has a danger in front of him/her.<br/><br/>CRAP. Over by thirty seconds. Still OK?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266002/#Comment_266002" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T15:46:41+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  3:46PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: #00CC33;">Everybody write 3 words on the palm of both hands then play rock paper scissors.<br/><br/>The winner matches winning rock, paper, or scissors with the 1st 2nd or 3rd word, respectively.<br/><br/>Winner then crosses out that word and 'uses' the word in play.<br/><br/>If, in a subsequent round, a Rock Paper Scissors win corresponds to a word that's already crossed-out,<br/>that reverses the win into a big Lose.

Nasocorn is awesome the way it is, or at least the way it was when I last played it a year ago, and you should publish it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266250/#Comment_266250" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T23:49:14+00:00" title="April  8, 2010 11:49PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my own, somewhat disjointed entry.<br/><br/>365 SALVATION<br/><br/>There's a new, easily made drug on the market: 365 rush. <br/><br/>Take it an you're unstoppable at everything for 365 seconds. Afterwords, you die.<br/>This has rocked the world. As the balance of power shifts, what will be the fallout?<br/><br/>Play is not linear: each scene is a different event showing an effect the drug is having on the world in microcosm. <br/><br/><b>Example Scenes</b>: Suicide bombing via unstoppable rampage, assassination attempts, revolts, murder-suicides, heroic martyrdom, meetings of heads of state, meetings of other groups in power, people at home on the home-front, people at home in a war-zone or area in a revolution. Choose dark themes, for these are dark times.<br/><br/><b>System</b>: Describe a series of events, other players add to this. Roll to determine the outcome:<br/>1: Fuck up.<br/>2-3: Complications<br/>4+: Just as Planned<br/><br/>Those "rushing" roll 1d6, all others roll 1d4.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266252/#Comment_266252" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T23:50:18+00:00" title="April  8, 2010 11:50PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>Was the original post composed in &lt; 365 seconds?<br/>If so, it meta-wins its own contest.</blockquote>\nIndeed it was.
