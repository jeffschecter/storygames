So you need to photocopy some character sheets and that's about it. If you are facilitating, you should read the whole book so you can be an informal reference for the background (Kiva societies, clans, sins) and system.\n<blockquote> Is it a campaign game, or better for one-shots?</blockquote>\nIt is well engineered for short runs of 3-5 sessions. You can run one-shots but that is not the sweet spot. \n<blockquote> How's it different from other games out there?</blockquote>\nI think it is pretty different, particularly the way it infuses gender into everything and brings forth the culture through play. The conflict resolution system is pretty standard, but it is carefully balanced to encourage players to move their characters outside social norms and commit sins, which is chocolate-dipped awesome.\n<blockquote> What bits will I want to steal after playing?</blockquote>\nI think there's a pretty impressive connection between fiction and mechanics that pushes the game's universe to the fore in a clever way. As I said I love the way it handles gender.\n<blockquote> What else do I want to know?</blockquote>\nAs long as one person knows WTF is going on, nobody else needs to know anything before sitting down to play. Everything you need to know about the world is learned as you choose your characters background - Kiva society, mother's clan, father's clan. It's a very low-prep situation and it works great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283498/#Comment_283498" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T10:10:14+00:00" title="July 29, 2010 10:10AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How many players are needed to play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283500/#Comment_283500" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T10:23:14+00:00" title="July 29, 2010 10:23AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (For reference, the game page is <a href="http://galileogames.com/how-we-came-to-live-here/" rel="nofollow">here</a>)<br/><br/>I believe it takes 3-5 players, with two of them acting in GM-like roles ("Inside Player" and "Outside Player").<br/><br/>I've looked at the PDF enough to whet my interest, and I'm hoping to get a chance to play a bit at Gen Con.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283508/#Comment_283508" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T11:16:31+00:00" title="July 29, 2010 11:16AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2010 11:17AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, you could play with up to five people easily. The rules don't scale beyond three protagonists, though, so you really can't play with a larger group - it'd be a mess. You can also play with a single GM, but that is not optimal, because there is a cool give and take between Inside and Outside, and you also get two brains working on every problem.  I think the sweet spot is two GMs and two players - that's how I'm playing now and it is rockin'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283569/#Comment_283569" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T15:21:16+00:00" title="July 29, 2010  3:21PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played with 3, 4, and 5 players (and 6 players, which is why I say the game doesn't support this many).
