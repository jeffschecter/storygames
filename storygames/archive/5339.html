The hell you say!\n<blockquote>Forget all that mythic tragedy beneath the fading stars stuff: I wanted to try Polaris as a modern spy game. It seemed perfect for the job, since the key conflict phrases looked like they would work really well for rapidly spawning the kinds of twists and revelations that are the meat of espionage. Flexible, but with a rules structure that fostered collaborative discovery. I was anticipating exchanges like:<br/><br/>\u201cI open the safe and find the stolen files. Go me!\u201d<br/>\u201cBut Only If you also find evidence that your partner was working for the other side.\u201d<br/>\u201cOkay, But Only If he did it against his will \u2014 he was blackmailed or something.\u201d<br/>\u201cSure, And Furthermore you find information he gave them about you to set up that assassination attempt you escaped. Willing or not, he sold you out too.\u201d<br/>\u201cDamn!

It really does click onto the spy genre without much modification.<br/><br/>I skipped over it in the post but naturally we changed the starting aspects -- Office: "Agent of Northstar", Ability: "Spycraft", and Asset: "Pistol" (if you wanted it).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>What did you for the Zeal/Weariness/Experience/Tragic Fate deal?

We're only one session in, so we haven't really had to tackle veteran-hood or anything like that yet, but I think the dark revelation in the spy genre is less about switching sides than it is about realizing that both sides are just as bad, that "we" aren't any different from "them." That's probably the Aspect that we'll apply when someone hits veteran ("Our side is no different than theirs").<br/><br/>Experience checks are for all the normal reasons (callousness, cynicism, despair, etc) but also for being ruthless about the job, putting the mission above your morals/humanity.

I'm sure that will change as we push characters more.<br/><br/>Another thing is that unless the antagonist is considered to "have the disadvantage", the Heart knows that as a starting character calling for a die roll means you are going to lose (1 in 6), so if you use "It shall not come to pass" you aren't going to stop things just get Experience. I didn't find any explanation of "disadvantage" in the text, so I'm assuming it's just an objective judgement about the situation ("he's at the wrong end of my sniper rifle").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120795/#Comment_120795" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T16:01:06+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  4:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, no!

I'm spoiled by just being able to do searches in PDFs (speaking of which, IPR doesn't have a Polaris PDF but your blog mentions it -- where does one buy it?)<br/><br/>Basically that means if you call for "It shall not come to pass" as a starting character you'll probably lose. Or if the antagonist calls for it, you'll probably win. So I'm guessing the first batch of Experience comes from the other conditions (callous, bad sympathies, whatever) until the numbers get to the point where choosing It shall not come to pass means you think maybe it won't. Or you choose to intentionally lose to generate Experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120813/#Comment_120813" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T16:49:29+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  4:49PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, no PDF!<br/><br/>Not likely for the foreseeable future, either.
