Finally I just made my own. <br/><br/>I made all playbooks, all the moves, and I have it posted on the AW world forums and the files are <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuxPp1f9zqBth0xe7QvZ4Jxmqt9m" rel="nofollow">here</a>, So I guess what I am asking is how to progress from here? Have playtests, gather feedback sure but how do I do that?<br/><br/><b><a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuxPp1f9zqBth0xe7QvZ4Jxmqt9m" rel="nofollow">Planet of the Week</a></b> is a hack of AW and Monster of the week heavily influenced by television and movie tropes much like MoTW. Its got familiar modern and futuristic character archetypes. I have retained the class structure of MoTW (simple and straightforward) and the streamlined storytelling of AW. The game play is focused on working as a crew (with complications) going from planet to planet in a harsh universe. Much like the dirty feel of <i>Alien</i> and <i>Firefly</i>, the adventure of <i>Farscape</i> and <i>Stargate SG1</i>, and a little of the exploration in<i>startrek</i>. More gritty than space opera-y, but not necessarily serious either.     <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454379/#Comment_454379" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-30T19:07:45+00:00" title="June 30, 2016  7:07PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd start by playing a ton of AW-derived games, and enthusiastically helping other designers playtest their games-in-progress.

I didn't mean to imply I was a complete noob, I have looked at a lot of posts and other hacks but I never thought of play testing new games that's a good suggestion!<br/><br/>I guess I was looking more for a what are the steps to proceed from a hack I have only played at my house to fully fledged game. Are there better or worse ways to give out the material, pitfalls I should avoid. How do you select playtesters? How do you generate interest and where should I post to seek help (other than here and AW forums). <br/>If I plan to publish at some point should I hold stuff back? Should I make a blog dedicated to the game?<br/><br/>I had a feeling I was being to vague before and that is my bad, I'm trying to not overshare, but I think simply feeling uncertain about things and looking for a little direction to shore up my nerves. <br/><br/>I read the "be specific" advice and yet I'm still kinda ignoring it. But let me try:<br/><br/>I have everything I need to begin playtesting, and have done a little with my friends, but I don't know enough people who game to get enough feedback. So I'm posting my game online and want to continue to develop it. <br/><br/>What is my next step?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454394/#Comment_454394" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T04:02:40+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  4:02AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless you're very lucky, you're unlikely to get many playtesters just by putting the game out there.<br/><br/>I've found that running an in-development game at conventions is a good way to both introduce people to what is fun about it, and also to find a few people who are keen to play it themselves after.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454411/#Comment_454411" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T15:26:57+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  3:26PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Unless you're very lucky, you're unlikely to get many playtesters just by putting the game out there.<br/><br/>I've found that running an in-development game at conventions is a good way to both introduce people to what is fun about it, and also to find a few people who are keen to play it themselves after. </blockquote>\nFair enough, I have just such an event in mind at a fledgling local con (at the very least I can get the organizers to play it). I'm glad to know I am on the right track.  <br/><br/>By the way Mike I must say I am huge fan of your work, MoTW struck me as a uniquely brilliant adaptation of the AW rules. Both General enough and specific enough to tell lots of different stories in the genre. Hell its what made think this was possible.

I will say for the record that the link to the current project (complete with playbooks, and Reference sheets) are in the original post (and <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuxPp1f9zqBth0xe7QvZ4Jxmqt9m" rel="nofollow">here for good measure</a>). If you end up having the time or inclination to give it a quick look over. <br/><br/>Next step record the next real play we have, probably at that con towards the end of July.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
