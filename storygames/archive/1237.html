<p>After Tuesday night's promising playtest I started putting together a proper rules document for my new version of <em>the Infected</em>.  Problem is, I don't have much experience writing for an audience.  Most of the stuff I write is just for me.  There's less than a dozen pages to the new rules and it took me most of a day to put it all together.</p>
<p>So, if you've got a few minutes, I'd love it if you could take a peek at the rules.  Let me know where they seem confusing or incomplete.  That would be awesome.</p>
<p>Also, there's one part I haven't finished writing yet.  I just don't know what to do about an afterward or epilogue.  See, the idea of an epilogue seems to be a bit contrary to the genre.  Can't have a happily ever after in a horror film, now can we?  Besides, there always has to be room for a sequel!  But then... there's the issue of letting the players have one final say after the last act.  I really just don't know what to do with it.  Hit me with some ideas.</p>

                            Actually, most horror sci-fi oriented movies have a short 3-20 seconds epilogue that opens the route to a sequel.<br/><br/>In horror movies, the final say is not that of the protagonists.                        </div>

<p>I think that may really be the key. Setting up for the sequel.</p>
<p><code>In horror movies, the final say is not that of the protagonists.</code></p>
<p>That's kind of where I'm hung up right now.  The players make a connection with their protagonists.  Not all of the protagonists will be turned to monsters in every game.  I want every player to have a voice in the end of the story.  So, what guidelines for the players to narrate a classic end-of-film epilogue?</p>
<p>I'm totally blanking out.</p>

                            In Undead, the sole surviving protagonist does a voice over of how she's protecting her cell of humanity awaiting the return of the saviours with her quadruple shotgun and gas mask. She's setting up a new equilibrium, a new status quo, from which a sequel can be launched, maybe?                        </div>

<p>Here's a thought that occurred to me this morning.</p>
<p>I was thinking to myself; What kind of patterns are there in the endings of monster movies?  Especially zombie movies?</p>
<p>And the answer that came to me was that the happiness of the ending seems to be inversely proportional to the number of protagonists that survive the climax.  If only the geeky guy and his hot girlfriend survive the end, then they get the happy music and sail off into the sunset.  On the other hand, if only one or two of the characters get torn apart by the mobs of living dead, then during the credits we hear the suspense music and get to see blurry images of people running for their lives.</p>
<p>It seems like a potientially cool mechanism.  If more than half the PCs survive, then you get the violent ending.  If less than half of them survive, then you get either the happy or mournful ending, but it's peaceful.</p>
<p>But that still leaves me with; Who gets to narrate?</p>

                            Haven't had more than a chance to skim lightly through the rules but I'll make a suggestion: I like the idea of one of the dead PC's getting to narrate a violent ending, a living one the mournful/happy ending. <br/><br/>btw, top of p. 8:<br/>"Almost inevitably he or she will contract some the infection."<br/>I think you mean some *of*.

<p>Good catch Ian.  I'm pretty sure that originally read "... contract some form of the infection.", to which I intened to remove "..some form of..."  And apparently I missed the word "some" when I did the cutting.</p>
<p><code>Corpses don't do voiceovers.</code></p>
<p>Sooo... you're saying that players who's PCs turn to monsters don't get to say anything for the epilogue?  That doesn't seem like any kind of fun at all.</p>
<p>I'd much rather see players who've lost their ability to achieve their character's goal be invigorated to ahieve a new goal.  Like making sure that all the other characters die.  Or something like that.</p>

That yawning gap between what you want and what you get ... that unfulfilled, empty feeling ... maybe I'm the only one who thinks that's fun.

                            Not having had a chance to read the rules yet either, I'll quickly throw in the suggestion that maybe players/survivors get the narration rights for the epilogue, but in a structured fashion- for example, you could mechanically dictate how many positive and negative moments there are:<br/>
<br/>
Player: "we made it! All the horror is behind us now and we can live happily in this abandoned military base, safe from harm!"<br/>
GM: "except for...?"<br/>
Player: "Uh... except that... far away, in Washington, someone has pushed The Button!  Will our characters survive the tactical strike?"<br/>
<br/>
In other words, players have narration, but within certain parameters determined by gameplay (number of survivors, number of overall successes, etc.)                        </div>

<p>Thanks for the awesome input everyone.</p>
<p>Mark came by to play some DitV last night, and afterward we sat and chatted about <em>the Infected</em> for a bit.  I think the system I'm going to try for my next few playtests is this;</p>
<p>There is no epilogue.  The final scene wrapts it all up.  With one caveat and one possible addition.  The caveat being that all of the players need to be aware of the pacing that's induced by the GM's use of his infected pool.  In our last playtest, when I was down to two dice during the second act I alerted the rest of the players to this fact.  That's probably something that should be in the rules.  The possible addition would be, after the final scene of act three, having the GM ask the players to collaboratively answer the question; "What scenes, if any, do we see while the credits are rolling?"</p>

                            I have been looking over the playtest rules and just have a quick question--I'm confused a little by the NPC dice.  If I read it right, the first time a player narrates in an NPC, they don't get any dice for it?  In the same vein, since the first time an NPC appears, it is introduced by a player, the GM never gets the +3 dice?  It almost makes me wonder if the columns are reversed?                        </div>

                            The first time an NPC gets introduced, the player gets no help in terms of dice at all.If a player decides to take an NPC that the GM has narrated in against someone else, then the GM gets the bonus of 3 in that conflict. It doesn't happen often, but can be useful if a player doesn't want what another player is shooting for.                        </div>

<p>Good question, Ian.</p>
<p>It's true, the first time an NPC is involved in a conflict he or she isn't worth crap for helping out a player.  However, just because you are introducing the character does not mean that the character is there to help you.  Also, you may use an NPC card for an NPC who's already been introduced by someone else.</p>
<p>It's legit to introduce a character who's in conflict with one of the PCs, yours or someone else's.  It's also legit to write the name of an NPC who's already been authored by the GM onto a card.  In either case, if you choose to hand that card over to the GM to play, then the GM gets to roll those three dice.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>

                            Yes, I'm pretty sure it does.  Let me just pose this situation to see if I do have it:<br/><br/>So it could be perfectly legit to write an NPC into the game during another player's scene with the hopes that the GM will pick them up and really stick it to that player, right?  <br/><br/><i>Also, you may use an NPC card for an NPC who's already been introduced by someone else.</i><br/><br/>An NPC who already has a card or just one that has been narrated without a card being issued?<br/><br/>I also notice that there is this term 'Dead' NPC--does this mean that the NPC's influence can be narrated into a scene even after they have died?

<p><strong><em>So it could be perfectly legit to write an NPC into the game during another player's scene with the hopes that the GM will pick them up and really stick it to that player, right?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yup.  But you don't have to just hope.  You can hand the card right to the GM and ask him to play the NPC.</p>
<p><strong><em>An NPC who already has a card or just one that has been narrated without a card being issued?</em></strong></p>
<p>Narrated, but not yet put on a card.</p>
<p><strong><em>I also notice that there is this term 'Dead' NPC--does this mean that the NPC's influence can be narrated into a scene even after they have died? Or is this a special thing like 'infected' that I am not getting?</em></strong></p>
<p>The 'dead' NPC thing is an accidental holdover.  I assume that you're looking at page 6, under "Ownership".  Up until this version of the text the NPC cards had the stats of "Infected" and "Dead" instead of "Infected" and "Monster".  Came from my assumption that the monsters would be the living dead.  With that assumption out the window, so was the label of "Dead".</p>
<p>But yes!  The NPCs-turned-monster can be narrated into a scene!  I mean, what could be better than seeing your highschool sweetheart back from the grave to eat your brains?  Nothing.  That's what.</p>
<p>However, hidden in the second to last paragraph on page 7 is the rule that only the GM can get dice in a conflict from Monster NPCs.  Once little Susie has been overcome by the infection, she's not much help to you at all.</p>

Given the way the progression works, is it fair to say that, as a player, the rules encourage you to narrate NPC's as often as possible so that when they do succumb to infection and can no longer be used by players, they at least don't have too many dice to provide?                        </div>

<p>I would say that the rules encourage you to bring important NPCs into conflicts as often as possible.  The more often they're used, the more they're helpful to PCs and not helpful to the GM.  And by "helpful to the GM" I, of course, mean "Dangerous to the PCs".</p>
<p>Edit;  Also, a slightly cleaned and corrected version of the main text is up on the site now.</p>
<p>Edit the second;  I totally read your question wrong at first.  So, my answer is; Yes!  But not only that, but also because they become more helpful to you.</p>
