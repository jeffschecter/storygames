Stronger, faster, smarter, more charismatic than the Fuhrer himself, and possessed of a skin not even bullets can penetrate, it is not known if Der Ubermensch has even begun to tap his full potential. He has singlehandedly handed the Nazis victories where defeat should have been certain, and thanks to his efforts, Britain is largely rubble. Though he will wear a traditional military uniform for state functions, he is usually seen flying under his own power into battle wearing nothing but a customized red cape bearing the swastika, unconcerned as he is by environmental extremes, or bourgeois notions of shame and modesty.<br/><br/>But underneath his relentless optimism and almost otherworldly attitude, there is a sense of growing unease. He has begun to realize that the worst threat to The Reich is not external, but indeed the very leaders of the Nazi Party themselves! Their bizarre obsessions and refusal to engage the realities of the situation have, if anything, been exacerbated by the successes of Das Ubermensch, and he is rapidly losing his patience with them. He has no time for these "camps" that have been set up, and sees them as a sign of mental illness, of weakness, and perhaps a sign that he should take control...but to what end?

Since I'm doing a WWII-based Imprint, I'll divide it into theaters of conflict.<br/><br/><b>THE EUROPEAN THEATER</b> (6 points)<br/>1) The war rages on, changing what it does not destroy outright.<br/>2) The darkest elements of the supernatural hide in the shadows of the conflicts.<br/>3) The darkest side of human nature easily bubbles to the surface. <br/><br/><b>THE RUSSIAN FRONT</b> (3 points)<br/>1) The Russian winters seem to go on forever.<br/>2) Cracks in Stalin's Russia are widening.<br/>3) Russia does not believe in tears. <br/><br/><b>THE PACIFIC THEATER</b> (4 points)<br/>1) The supernatural conflict spills into the open.<br/>2) Japan's brutality towards its neighbors is legendary.<br/>3) There is a doom that will fall, to pay for the injustices of this war.<br/><br/><b>THE UNITED STATES</b> (2 points)<br/>1) A looming dread of the future begins to grow.( +1)<br/><br/>I put the most points in the spaces where I suspect there will be the most player interest, and wrote down the three elements of each space that I think should be emphasized. The US is different, because I want to emphasize the effect of the war in ending American innocence and also the fear that superhuman beings engender in democracies, where the whole system is based on everyone being equal.

In this world, the illness forced Kafka to stare his own mortality in the face, and he pushed through his doubts and personal demons to come through the other side, miraculously cured and more physically and spiritually whole than before...just in time to see the Nazi menace begin in its full dark glory.<br/><br/>Reclaiming his family crest as his own, aided and abetted by his sisters and those who follow his lead, Franz Kafka churns out pamphlets by day that are a cross between Viktor Frankl and Thomas Paine, giving those under the heel of the Reich the will to fight back as best they can. By night, he is the Jackdaw, dressed as a man sized raven, whose strangled "KAW KAW!" fills Nazi soldiers and their accomplices with dread. His acts of sabotage throw a wrench into the well-oiled machine of Germany's expansion, and he is Public Enemy Number One in Germany.<br/><br/>However, his discovery of the camps has unhinged him a bit, splitting Kafka and The Jackdaw into two personalities, neither of whom realizes they share the same body. As Franz Kafka, he motivates the Underground and decries the terrorism of The Jackdaw. As The Jackdaw, he strikes terror both psychological and, with his research into mesmerism and mind-altering chemicals, physiological into the Nazi Empire, mocking Franz Kafka as a mewling appeaser and idealistic weakling.

Only his sisters understand that Kafka has basically split in two; the rest of the Underground assumes that Kafka wants plausible deniability, or has passed on the Jackdaw legacy to someone extremist enough to continue on with it. Thus far, his mind has been remarkably flexible in filling in lost time or explaining away one personality's connection to the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166311/#Comment_166311" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T09:57:13+00:00" title="August 31, 2008  9:57AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2008 10:05AM by spookyfanboy.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>RISING SON</b>(real name unknown)<br/><br/>Trauma Incarnation<br/>Elemental (Japan)<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motifs:</span></b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Affinity</span>: 4<br/>Control Japan, and Japanese territories: +1<br/>Move anywhere or any time in the past in Japan (and territories): +1<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consciousness</span>: 2<br/>See anywhere in Japan (or Territories): +1<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Domain:</span> 5<br/>Japan, or it's Territories: +2<br/>Courts of Heaven: 0<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Embodiment</span>: 1<br/>Immune to any Harmful Object Made in Japan, or Wielded by a Japanese Person: 0<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Archetype:</span></b> <i>Warrior</i> (8)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Marks</b>:</span><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scar:</span> Fear of Impending Doom<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shadow:</span> Hubris<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonds:</span></b><br/><br/>Japan Itself, his devotion and source of power: 8<br/>The Courts of Heaven, where he contests for more status: 2<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Code:</b></span><br/><br/>1) Issue: Must avert this impending doom I have seen for my homeland.<br/>2) Drive: Japan is the center of my universe, and must be given priority over every other concern.<br/>3) Obligation: Protect and nurture Japan and it's people, encouraging them to flourish. <br/><br/>Note that I added two advances, seeing as he is now in his Trauma Incarnation, and an NPC anyway.

It speaks with a voice that comes out of nowhere, and seems eerily modulated. It is hyper-intelligent, and capable of seeing atomic reactions. It can also rearrange matter on the atomic level, giving it near-godlike capabilities. It designs bleeding-edge technology for the Allied effort, and uses it's control over matter to devastating effect: in one swoop it rescued Einstein and many other German scientists from Axis enslavement by teleporting them all to Washington, DC, and it's power as a weapon cannot be underestimated.<br/><br/>And yet, it grows increasingly detached from the world, despite those who need it.

The experiment mysteriously lost power at the same time the young Kaballist was incinerated by mysterious energy, and The Golem came to life. It is fueled by pain and rage, and tasked to gather up the Chosen People out of the camps, and forcibly relocate them to where Israel used to be, by any means necessary. It has generated a nightmarish swath of destruction over Europe, and has deposited many Jewish people on the borders of Palestine. It will listen, within limits, to someone of Jewish descent, and will never attack them, but it responds with wordless violence to anyone else. (It is mute, rarely howling in pain if it makes any noise at all.) It has loosely allied itself with The Jackdaw from time to time.

The Golem also understands anyone's thoughts as long as they are Jewish. Anyone else might as well be spouting gibberish, and will most likely be squished.<br/><br/>It is a sad, cold thing, and the void where a soul should be is filled by pain, rage, and a monomaniacal desire to save the Jews and deposit them in what used to be Israel.

Benito had no idea what the woman meant: the child was as a porcelain doll, and so sweet and bright! By no coincidence, he found out, his luck began to change, and he was able to form The Fascisti, and ride it's message of traditionalist populism all the way to the head of Italy itself. By 1925, thanks to her advice and her little "blessings" (which Mussolini did not believe in until later), he was firmly in control of Italy.<br/><br/>However, things took a turn for the sour by 1940. Angelina was adamant that Hitler and his flying male prostitute were not to be allied with, that it would only bring disaster and undo all the work that Mussolini had done. She and Mussolini had many arguments about this, some approaching violent. This was exacerbated by an unspoken and unacted-upon sexual tension that neither one wanted to acknowledge, let alone consummate.<br/><br/>One night, late 1940, things came to a head. Drunk and angry at the visions she described for him, he assaulted her, and vowed to show her what a woman's place is. To his horror, he found out something he had never even suspected: his beautiful little angel was a fully-equipped, fully-functional hermaphrodite. To her horror, it did not stop him from forcing himself on her.<br/><br/>She was locked in a cell in an undisclosed location, where she alternately wept and begged for forgiveness, and raged and lashed out at Mussolini. Almost overnight, Mussolini's campaign in Libya stalled and had to reconsolidate. He visited her many times, sometimes beating her, sometimes begging for forgiveness. still he never let her out of her cell, and demanded she perform for him as she always had.<br/><br/>By 1942, she could not take it. The broken bones and bruises healed over immaculately, but her heart was ready to break under the strain. She arranged for a band of Italian communists to find out about her, and help her escape. This is where she met Father Marco Antonioni, who declared that she was an angel fallen to earth. Now, while the Italian Underground aids the Allied invasion force and hides her, she gives them visions of the future and blesses their efforts. Soon, she predicts that Mussolini will fall, and will be killed. She does not know how to feel about that.<br/><br/>She has found faith in God, and it guides her actions. She feels unloved and alone, and has had thoughts about Father Antonioni, but fears to act upon them. In her dreams, she speaks with a Chinaman about the futures of their countries, and she takes comfort from those dreams. She has had one opportunity to converse with the Flying Man, and found him surprisingly sober and thoughtful about his country and its leadership. There is an odd kinship she feels with him, the kinship of outsiders. But nowhere does she find love, nor what she really wants: respect and acceptance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.
