                    So, I've been kicking around some ideas for a <i>Gormenghast</i> game, but I wanted to run some things by the fine folks here first.<br/><br/>First off, I want to tell you what I'm seeing as core elements of what I want to capture.  I'll provide them in handy-dandy list form, and I'm hoping to find out if I'm missing anything that other people see as important.  What would people suggest I add?  Are there things here that don't belong?  I may or may not take your advice, but it will most certainly be helpful to me in thinking this through. <br/><br/><i>Themes and Design Goals</i><br/>- Class matters.<br/>- Ritual matters.<br/>- Place within the castle matters, but geography does not. (The castle resists maps.)<br/>- Fate is more important than destiny.<br/>- Karma is a bitch.<br/><br/><i>The Castle</i><br/>- The game takes place entirely within a castle or mansion or other kind of building.<br/>- The castle (etc.) is a character in play.<br/>- The inner nature of the castle is reflected in the sorts of conflicts the characters play out.<br/><br/><i>Other Characters</i><br/>- Characters have roles within the castle, and natures within themselves.<br/>- Characters can escape neither their role nor their nature.<br/>- Characters are somehow larger than life.<br/><br/>Second off, I don't want to create a game in which you just have to play out <i>Gormenghast</i>.  I want to encompass the entire genre of fantasy-gothic play.  What I want to know is this: what else would you suggest I make sure to look at in this genre?  I've already read <i>Feersum Endjinn</i>, which is technically sci-fi-gothic but feels the same to me.  What else should be on my list?<br/><br/>Finally, do you think I should keep it fairly tied to that genre, or should I try to expand it to cover other forms of the gothic?  I think it would be fairly easy to do, say, "A Rose for Emily" or other Southern gothic stories with the game I have in mind, but the language is going to get tough if I have to flip back and forth between talking about mansions, castles, etc.<br/><br/>Hey, if this game is as kick-ass as I think it's going to be, maybe I can just do the Faulkner expansion.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-- Jess<br/><br/>PS: I really should be writing other things, but I think that I've gotten bit by this game.  Oh dear!                </div>

                            You should think about how to provide conflict.<br/>
<br/>
For example, characters cannot escape their role or nature. But most of the times they try and this is a terrible source of distress. Why should the players try?                        </div>

                            Another character to include is the one who has no role and no nature; the Other.  This character should have no owner, as well, and should be passed around from player to player.  The polymorphous nature of play of the Other, because s/he gets passed around, is a feature, not a bug; the Other is, indeed, insane by the standards of the Castle.                        </div>

This sounds like it rocks. I don't know Gormenghast, so I've got nothing useful to add, though.<br/>
<br/>
I like the ideas of the Other and the Castle.<br/>

<p>From your list of things, I feel like <em>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</em> is a good thing to look at, but I haven't even finished reading that yet, so take the suggestion as tentative.</p>
<p>I'm fascinated to hear more about <em>ritual matters.</em> Please elaborate?</p>

                            Graham:<br/><br/>If it rocks as hard as I think it will, I want TWO postcards.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Arturo: <br/><br/>Yes, conflict is going to be built into the nature of the castle, but also in the conflict between nature and role.  Beyond that . . . we'll see how the ongoing design goes.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Vaxalon:<br/><br/>The Other.  YES.  Awesome.<br/><br/>Shreyas:<br/><br/>Hmm, I've been meaning to read that anyhow.  Now I definitely will.<br/><br/>As for <i>ritual matters</i>, I mean this mostly within the world of the fiction (rather than in a <i>Polaris</i>-like sense, though that might also come up).  Doing things 'right' is important and gives you an advantage in succeeding, but is also the main way that other players and/or the GM (who I am thinking plays the Castle, and may have statted play/advancement in ways that will make Tony very happy) can introduce obstacles for you.  When you fail to sneak down the stairs, it's not because you lacked the skill, it's because on the third Tuesday of the month, all the stairs are draped with tiny bells painted blue and silver, making it impossible for any sneaking to happen.  That's the kind of feel I'm heading for.<br/><br/>Thanks for these initial thoughts!  You'll be hearing more about this post-finals, so if people still have suggestions or things to add, there's plenty of time before this project gets set in stone.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>
