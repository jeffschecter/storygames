Like, I love Changeling, okay?  It's totally my favorite of the new WoD.  One of the things I totally like is the Mask.  The annoying issue in the old Changeling of "Well, physically, am I really like my fae-self or my human self?" is answered firmly and conclusively in the new one.  That's good.  the Mask is also useful in that it nicely takes care of the "Why don't normal people know?" issue.  And that's important when you're playing changelings.<br/><br/>But when you're not, it's kind of a pain in the rear.  It's almost TOO effective.  I'm pretty sure it's the most effective "shield from mortal eyes" type effect in the nWoD.  There's very little chance, outside of GM fiat, that any mortal will see through the Mask without the changeling wanting them to.  This makes things kind of... awkward when the PCs are mortal hunters.  I mean, if a changeling more or less always looks human, what makes him seem any different to a mortal hunter from, say, a mage?  He's got funky powers, but he just looks like a dude.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm looking for from the smart people that might be listening is advice on two things:<br/>1) Suggestions on how I might hint at the otherworldly and fae nature of a changeling (or hob or True Fae) without necessarily letting the hunter PC actually look through the Mask.<br/>2) Suggestions on good times/circumstances to allow the PC to completely see through the Mask (at least for a moment) without the fae-critters complicity.  Currently I already have two ideas for this.  For one, I'll probably allow any detection/perception-based Endowments to work for fae stuff, or let them buy versions that work for fae-stuff without going through the mechanical R&amp;D procedure.  After all, the Hunter book tends to assume they'll be hunting a variety of things, and generally downplays fae-stuff a lot. (only one PC has access to any Endowments at the moment anyway, and that's Advanced Armory stuff but, for example, I'm thinking of having someone in TFV offer him a "prototype" variation on the Etheric Goggles that allows him to spot fae-type stuff, at least, you know, once he files some reports on things.  Not gonna just give it to him as a total freebie.)  The other idea I had was possibly allowing a glimpse through the Mask when a changeling activates a Contract or some other funky power.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207401/#Comment_207401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T14:09:37+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  2:09PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>I mean, if a changeling more or less always looks human, what makes him seem any different to a mortal hunter from, say, a mage?

From a campaign design perspective, as you point out, it's essentially a solution to several problems that you've identified as not being problems you want to mess with. So long as you don't encroach on those solutions (why mortals don't know, what they look like, etc.) then you are getting the benefit of the mechanic. <br/><br/>I would keep careful track of situations in which the Mask slips, for the second half of your game, and watch to see when the PCs get into similar situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207414/#Comment_207414" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T14:43:18+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  2:43PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Well, I don't see this as a bad thing about Changelings, rather, a good thing about Mages.

In all the shows like Supernatural, Buffy, Dracula, whatever there will usually come a moment where the thing that could pass for fully human suddenly, for no really great reason, is revealed as not so human. So, doing the same thing would have a certain logic. (Even if it is refrigerator logic.) <br/><br/>I mean, there should be emotional reasons why. The Hunters know what they're facing, they're up against something bad, and probably they should come in on the beastie while its doing something bad, or in its stronghold of badness, or both. Combining the knowledge, their special place as hunters, the emotional impact of the scene, and (possibly) the direct use of powers or nearness of the hedge (cause the Hedge can be just, wherever, right?) -- it should give just enough reason so that when the Mask suddenly comes down (even if just for a few seconds) it won't kill the flow of the scene. <br/><br/>And, as JD says, when the PCs get on the other side of the stick, they can't be quite so sure that the Mask will always cover them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207448/#Comment_207448" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T16:38:43+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  4:38PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>when the PCs get on the other side of the stick, they can't be quite so sure that the Mask will always cover them.</blockquote>Which I'm not convinced is a good thing.  I've been doing some thinking about the reasons that Changelings are innately better protected from being seen by mortals than, say, Prometheans.  I think it may be important to the story. Of course, it depends on exactly what kind of story we end up trying to tell.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite>Couldn't they, like your average CoC investigator, find clues that lead to a supernatural explanation ? They could learn about the way they gather glamour from some notebook found on a crime scene and deduct a method to spot changeling harvesting the stuff.</blockquote>This is happening and definitely will happen.  For some reason, though, it just bothers me that a fireheart changeling using her Contracts of the Elements to chuck a fireball at someone doesn't, on the surface, probably seem any different from a mage using his, ummm... Forces Arcana? (i haven't read new mage in a long time) to do the same thing.<br/><br/>At the moment I'm leaning toward an in-game solution to this "problem."  I think I may allow the PCs to become stymied at some point when one of their prey goes to ground and they have no way of identifying other changelings normally.  At that point I may have the Network Zero PC be approached by someone from a conspiracy (probably the Cheiron Group) offering "help" if he'll start feeding all of his information to them instead of spreading it all over the internet.<br/><br/>but...<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>the direct use of powers or nearness of the hedge (cause the Hedge can be just, wherever, right?)</blockquote>This is something I hadn't thought of at all!  It's entirely possible that the PCs might track a changeling or a hob creature through a doorway into their hollow in the hedge or something.  That would be a pretty interesting revelation for them.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207495/#Comment_207495" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T21:28:12+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  9:28PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very relevant suggestion from Brand indeed.

Or, if you use the expanded rules the the Dusk book, a changeling can potentially travel the skein to get into someone else's dream.<br/><br/>Normally I wouldn't really be worried too much about sticking to the rules, except that these mortal hunters are at some point going to become changelings.  So even when I'm not using the actual mechanics from a changeling book, I want to stick pretty close to the spirit of the rules from them.<br/><br/>Still, I am possibly interested in working in some oneiromancy stuff, so I'll have to think about this more...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207585/#Comment_207585" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T09:36:13+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  9:36AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't remember now, but I'm pretty sure that the second level of Contracts of Dream allows you to enter the dreams of others.

I'd love to be able to print out all the contracts from all the books to stuff in a binder.<br/><br/>but that has nothing to do with this thread.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
