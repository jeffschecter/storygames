It's bare-bones, just-the-facts setup, so feel free to ask me any clarifying questions in this thread. In short: if you know how to make a Champions/HERO PC, you can build a GLASS PC.<br/><br/>A few preliminary points/reminders/callouts:<br/>* Unless an Ability is Unlimited, it is usable once per Reset.<br/>* A Reset will occur anywhere from once every four hours (for line modules or very active, fest-style games) to once a day/meetup.<br/>* I am already aware of the problems inherent in "BOMB" Abilities--they are included much like "STOP" Abilities in Champions: there for those who want them and are willing to deal with their potential repercussions on the game/story.<br/><br/>Other than those common misunderstanding (which, honestly, I can't figure out how to make clearer other than with a LOT of repetition in the text), it should all be somewhat standard fare to folks familiar with points-buy systems.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance--front-matter credit in the book to all who help, so be sure to sign your feedback/character build with the name you want in the book (subject to editorial approval, for handles or pseudonyms).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
