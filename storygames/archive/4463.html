I've found threads on the Forge. The Power 19. And some other methods, but none of them really lay out some core design principles or where to start when you're staring at a blank page (preferably with some notes).  The Power 19 seems to work the best for me at first, but then it gets into mechanics, and, well I don't have those yet. All the components I've seen have been pieces, but it seems like for different puzzles.  I haven't found anything that tries to pull it altogether, or at the very least, clearly states "This is a place to start" ("a" not "the" I'm not looking for a definitive be-all thing).  So, maybe we can make one in the form of this thread.<br/><br/>So, I'm going to start this off by quoting Tony's tidbit of a design principle that I thought was helpful.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Okay, first item:  Feedback.<br/><br/>You have some resource (say<em>money</em>), in amount X.  You have an activity which requires that resource (say playing the stock market).<br/><br/>There is a<em>big difference</em>between an activity which costs you X and returns X+1, and an activity which costs you X and returns X-1.  Yes?  That is, generally speaking, the difference between positive and negative feedback.<br/><br/>Positive feedback will make things explode ... very reliably.  People who start rich will become much, much richer at an exponential rate.  Fighters who get experience from fighting to plow into more fighting will become very fightworthy.<br/><br/>Negative feedback tends to make things damp to a common ground.  People who start rich will become ... well, poor again.  Fighters who get experience for searching for peaceful solutions, to plow into fighting skills that make peace more difficult to attain will tend to find a balance point.<br/><br/>Make sense?</blockquote>\nYes, it does, thanks Tony.<br/><br/>So, I'm wondering.  Where do you start?  How do you get from brainstorming to game making?  Do some people start with mechanics and build story/setting/theme around it, how about the other way around? Do you start with some sort of design doc, or do you play around with mechanics until something strikes a chord?  What are other design principles?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100923/#Comment_100923" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T19:48:50+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  7:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is an "if I'd known this starting out I'd have saved a lot of time" piece of advice:<br/><br/>Decide what kind of story you want your game to support.

When I get an idea for a game it's usually of what I thinkof as the "surface" stufff. Stuff like "Psychic Japanese school girls blowing shit up". Once I have that I try to strip it down to the very essence of the idea. I say "try" because a lot of times I think you can strip and idea down and not realize there are still plenty of otehr layers that you haven't touched yet. But that's fine. I strip my ideas until I get to the part that I really want to focus on. The one thing the game will really be about. Then I try to think of a way to build a game around that. Ususally this is a bunch of false starts followed by a brainstorm and a lot of furious writing. What I've found is that when I have the right idea everything feels really right. If I haven't found the right idea yet I definetly know it. <br/><br/>But that' s just me maybe.<br/><br/>jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100964/#Comment_100964" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T03:00:35+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  3:00AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I take a lot from hacker philosophy.

And it's difficult to know where to start when you're designing. Would an example help? <br/><br/>I wrote a game recently for the Sight and Sound competition called <i>kalma</i>. <br/><br/>First of all, I looked at the ingredients. The picture of an old man reminded me of an idea I had about 12 years ago for a supplement for Wraith. It was sort of 'Buffy, if everyone was old'. So I wrote down 'old people vs the supernatural' (notice how I assume the versus). The 'liminal' ingredient was interesting. What if the old people were close to death? Inspired by things like <a href="http://www.hekeba.com/games/insectsofgod.pdf" rel="nofollow">Insects of God</a>, how about the characters have just one more task they can achieve? And I didn't worry about fitting in the last ingredient, as both the 'freaky choir' and 'heavy breathing' could fit. And let's call it <i>kalma</i> coz it's a word I like.<br/><br/>So. Old people. What are old people about? Rage, rage against the dying of the light. So characters have one last burst of energy/enthusiasm before they die. The system should involve balancing traits. <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Doom_Semper_Fidelis.php" rel="nofollow">Semper Fidelis</a> balances Health/Ammo/Time for a Doom-inspired game. So what would old people have to balance? Time left. Health. Enthusiasm. A storygame with no relationships seems wrong, so characters have to maintain connectedness to people. <br/><br/>The best idea I had at this point was inspired by one of Judd's character sheets with a section 'what do you hate about this character?' So what if in <i>kalma</i>, the character sheet had a question 'What is it you can no longer do?' That ties in to the feeling of regret. There may also be a mechanical aspect to it - perhaps like the negative traits in Cold City or penalty dice in TSOY. But perhaps it just provides color or assistance in scene framing.<br/><br/>Ah! Inability! How about instead of Health and Energy, you have traits like Frailty and Tiredness? It'd be cool to have the attributes be the opposite of most games - stuff you <i>can't</i> do. This reminded me of a fantasy game where the attributes were Clumsy and Stupid. So maybe the attributes count down somehow.<br/><br/>Then I wrote a character sheet. At the top, a space for name, a thing you can't do, and three attribute tracks. Then four tracks. Then back to three. I eventually settled on three - Tired, Lonely and Frail. 'Time' didn't make thematic sense, though I considered the possibility that a character running out of time (but not the other three) would fall to accidents.<br/><br/>Players should be able to fight back. So like <i>Semper Fi</i>, let's include stances: temporary bonuses the characters could buy. Let's match them to attributes. Energised, Connected and Healthy. Healthy's too passive, let's call ir Vigourous. Energised is boring too, let's call it Stubborn. When players use these stances, the word 'stubborn' will inform play - the player is likely going to play the character as stubborn, which is far more interesting than 'energetic'. Cool. <br/><br/>Now, characters could just buy bonus dice. But buying flavorful stances seems somehow more interesting. There's a chance that everyone would end up similarly stubborn (and the characters all feel like Statler and Waldorf) but let's see where this goes.<br/><br/>This all took three days.<br/><br/>How's that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100979/#Comment_100979" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T04:47:30+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  4:47AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everybody's different, right?  Find a way that works for you.  I know people who start with existing games they like and play their new idea using that system until it breaks, which gives them a starting point for something new.  I know people who are obsessed with mechanical interactions and let the game's theme emerge as a gloss on those at first, like German board games.  I think I start with the experience of play and try to tease out what sort of things I want that to be like.  I often think about things like the length and character of an instance of play, and how to keep handling time to a minimum, while building the game to reinforce the things I want to be important.  <br/><br/>Here's an example - I'm working on a game about people who fly airplanes during a war, and the terror of their missions.  So what I really want to focus on is that terror, and also their personal stories.  I don't really give a shit about the missions themselves beyond their utility as color and a source of adversity - this is the first important realization I made by looking hard at my source material and inspiration.  So the question I was asking myself in this case was "how do I include the content of their missions without having some tedious board gamey mission component?"  And the answer I came up with is a debriefing scene.  The regimental commander asks you how the mission went, and the pilot and navigator's players answer in character, and both the adversity and the way it was addressed are resolved in real time (in this case, using playing cards).  And once I had that piece, I asked myself "once this interaction is concluded, you've got a little stack of eight playing cards.  How can I use those to resolve an actual scene relating to the character's stories, and how can the results of the mission impact that?"  And so on, iteratively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100982/#Comment_100982" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T05:10:57+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  5:10AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>So, I'm wondering.

My <i>goal</i> is to have a series of measurable, objective targets such that I can say "If players do X, Y, Z and A, B, C reliably happen in the game then the game successfully captures the feeling I want," but I never start out with that.  The challenge of turning a feeling into a formula is ... a substantial one.  I think it's part of what the Power 19 and other "What do you <i>want</i> from the game?" questionnaires try to tease out.<br/><br/>My method to get from feeling to formula is playtesting.  I make a formula that I think will support the feeling, and then I make a game that expresses that formula as an emergent property, and then I play the game.  Some things do work, some things don't, and I get a better idea of what formula I should <i>really</i> be designing for.  Then I make another game.<br/><br/>As you might guess from the above:  Going from formula to game design is (at least for me) the easiest part of the process.  Easy enough that I use it as a tool to address the other parts of the process.  Once you have an actual formula you're just shuffling math about in fairly predictable ways.  That's why so much design advice addresses the chain from formula to design:  it's the part where people can speak with most authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101077/#Comment_101077" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T11:30:33+00:00" title="October  4, 2007 11:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm one of the oddballs that starts with mechanics.

And as that's my area of expertise (as much as one can be an expert without being published) I can attest there are multiple methods which you can use as a basis.  I can give you at least three very different "how to write a novel" techniques, that probably aren't all inclusive, but probably cover a wide range of people.

I really like it in principle.  The only shot I've given it so far resulted in a conversation between "the GM" and "a player" that was basically the player asking for rules clarification and the GM answering and guiding.  In other words, it was my debate over how to implement the mechanics for the result I want that goes on in my head <i>constantly</i> with personalities added on. Which might have been okay, but it didn't sound fun.

Going from your core theme/conflict/<i>the one thing</i> do you play with possible mechanics that seem to highlight it (and if so, are false starts when you realize the mechanic is no good, or when the one thing needs to change?) or do you make a character sheet or flesh out the core <i>thing</i> into some related <i>things</i> and built a interrelated web of cause and effect?  <br/><br/>When you get to building, in context of the quote above, do you see yourself making a blueprint, or do you have a hammer in one hand, wood in the other, and nails in your teeth?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101111/#Comment_101111" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T13:14:56+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  1:14PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once I have a basic Idea, I start with thinking about, "who gets to control what?"

The regimental commander asks you how the mission went, and the pilot and navigator's players answer in character, and both the adversity and the way it was addressed are resolved in real time (in this case, using playing cards).  And once I had that piece, I asked myself "once this interaction is concluded, you've got a little stack of eight playing cards.

That's actually a bug, not a feature, and I want to broaden the way I approach design challenges a bit eventually.  I actually tackled it first because it was easiest, and the output of my current solution (a little pile of eight cards just begging to be reincorporated elegantly) is driving the solution to the larger problem, which is how to structure the meat of the game.  There's some serendipity at work for sure.  Example:  In <i>Grey Ranks</i>, I realized I needed the thing your character holds dear to be an in-game resource you could use and ultimately destroy.  This decision drove the design in unexpected directions, influenced the way scenes are structured and paced, and the overall tenor of the game.

I have everything from pages-long rambling manifestos to three-line resource trading restrictions.  Usually, they are so small or incomplete that they do not make much sense on their own.  So like:<br/><br/>"What if by merely playing the game, you lose resources, and you only gain respurces by winning (something).  You must maintain a positive net gain to stay in the game."

I really like this example.  Having played a bit of Grey Ranks, I can see the ways that this concept acted as a core to the design process (or at least a large part of it).<br/><br/>I've been using "the one thing" to refer to, well whatever the core idea happens to be.  I really like the idea of starting with a resource with a mechanic that will influence play.  That's much more solid than some of the examples I was thinking of.  I realize I do have something like that, but I sort of left it at "It will effect the characters somehow" and I have just assumed that I knew what that was because, hey, I want an emotionally gripping game so it will do whatever it needs to do.  I was afriad of limiting myself by getting too defined.

What does building entail? What when those false starts turn up, what would you say the "starts" are?  Going from your core theme/conflict/<i>the one thing</i>do you play with possible mechanics that seem to highlight it (and if so, are false starts when you realize the mechanic is no good, or when the one thing needs to change?) or do you make a character sheet or flesh out the core<i>thing</i>into some related<i>things</i>and built a interrelated web of cause and effect?<br/><br/>When you get to building, in context of the quote above, do you see yourself making a blueprint, or do you have a hammer in one hand, wood in the other, and nails in your teeth?<br/><br/>I don't know. Once I have my core idea, I usually find everything else comes pretty easy. I can't really explain it. Do you draw? It's like with a drawing that's going well. You know exactly where to put each line. Of course, sometimes I get a false starts and I have to tear down everything I've been working on. I recently ditched a really nice dice mechanic I've been working on for Suicide Beast in favor of a conflict resolution s\\system using a cap gun. I knew the cap gun was the right choice as soon as it crossed my mind. I guess false starts are when I realize the mechanic, device, approach or idea that I've been working hard in just isn't going to work. I usually only realize this when something better comes along (like the cap gun).<br/><br/>When I do get to building, I very usually start with a rough outline of the game text, then move right away into a first full draft. I find it helps my organize my thoughts and get a better idea of how the game will work. Once I have my first crappy rough draft I read it a few times and try to play it in my head. This is usually the point when I end up throwing out a bunch of stuff that doesn't work at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101173/#Comment_101173" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T19:56:07+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  7:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>Was this realization something that came out of brainstorming or did it happen in the middle of design like a Eureka moment?</blockquote>\nI knew pretty early on, but there were many, many ugly implementations before it really worked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101263/#Comment_101263" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T09:32:40+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  9:32AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>It sounds like you tried (or still do) playtest Misery Bubblegum solo.

The reason (I think) is that players are as much and as continually motivated by what they <i>don't know</i> as they are by what they know.<br/><br/>I can firewall information that I know, and say to myself "Okay, I won't act on that information."  I'm a gamer, after all.  But I find it <b>much</b> harder to firewall information and say to myself "Man, I <i>really need to figure that out!</i>" and act from that passion when, in fact, I already know the thing.

I don't know what this other character thinks but ... well, I guess I'll take the chance, bet it all, put myself on the line!" with anything even remotely resembling sincerity.

This is just how I do it.<br/><br/>When working on a game design, I think about it in different layers. <br/><br/>There's <b>play experience</b>. What kind of play do I expect this game to produce? I use the aforementioned Structured Design technique (which I find horrendously named, by the way, as it suggests a kind of decomposition mentality used in structured design in computer programming, and it isn't that). Basically, I write out examples of play or even broader outlines of play experience goals.<br/><br/>There's <b>game flow</b>. This is a refinement of play experience. What is the give and take among players at the table? How does interaction occur and in what places do I want to control it? This is IIEE territory, somewhat.<br/><br/>There's <b>authority</b>. This takes IIEE and Ron's four types of authority and mingles them a bit. Who can say what, and when? Who gets to decide things? Are there mechanics for shifting authority?<br/><br/>There's the <b>Big Model</b> or, rather, the deconstruction of my game idea into the layers of the Big Model. I look at the components of Exploration (Character, Setting, Situation, Color, System). I look at support for Creative Agenda. I recall Vincent Baker's rule, or something like it: "Nowhere to go but out" and make sure my game has something that bootstraps Situation in a meaningful way for the players. I don't want players creating characters then going, "Now what?"<br/><br/>There's <b>mechanics</b>. I want these to be fun and interesting, by themselves, but not be meaningful without the role-playing stuff. I've probably been fiddling with dice and currency and who knows what else in all the other layers of thought, but this step is where I really try to tease out the mechanical subgame and optimize it.<br/><br/>There's <b>optimization</b>. Here's where I cut out as much as I can and streamline stuff. I try to make different currencies and dice convert 1:1. I try to reduce handling time. I simplify.<br/><br/>I do all these things at once, really. Not in discrete steps. The actual mental process is nowhere near as clean as the layers above. I am just trying to deconstruct my messy mental process into something you could use.

You know Dave Sim? years ago he wrote something about how when you draw, when you really get into it and let yourself go, you can achieve a zen like state where your entirety is reduced down to just the tip of your pen. Everything is right and perfect and the drawing just flows out of you. The problem isn't so much reaching that state. Once you learn how to do it, it's pretty easy. The problem is maintaining it. This is very much how drawing is for me, and I've noticed tat I get something similar with game design. When I'm focused and on the right path, when I latch onto the right idea and run with it, my entire self focuses down to just the problem at hand, and I can stack the ideas one on top of the other and build something good and workable. This has only happened a few times so far.

I'm back to the designing board, and am pretty much out of questions at this point.  But that's not to say I'm abandoning this thread (I have a response for jake up next) but wanted to say that, and incase anyone was holding back on comments or questions that I didn't ask, they should feel free to jump in.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I am just trying to deconstruct my messy mental process into something you could use. Hope this helps!</blockquote>\nNaming processs are often helpful, thanks! <br/><br/>Speaking of Vincent, instead of examining the Big Model access points: I find his "Say Something," "Be There," or "Prove Yourself" goals to be helpful terms, particularly right now, thinking about new design.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>For those who might not have seen it, and may be wondering more about the idea of Design Patterns:<a href="http://legendaryquest.netfirms.com/books/Patterns.zip" rel="nofollow">http://legendaryquest.netfirms.com/books/Patterns.zip</a></blockquote>\nThat's one of the things I was hoping was out there, but it didn't jump out at me.

Perhaps those same tools can help you control and maintain it for design?<br/><br/>I think for me it's very much a matter of sitting down and actually letting myself create something. Clearing everything in my life out of the way and just creating. I never feel like a real person unless I'm deep in the creative process, so this is a really good thing for me. the problem is that it's really easy to let other things in your lfe creep in, until you have to negotiate with yourself for work time.

This is because it came from a 30 minute design contest where I had 3 words  and had to make a game around them (a game which had to have mechanics). <br/><br/>Because I didn't start by thinking about what play would be like, but started with a setting and then rules, its been harder later to make those rules produce the play I want.<br/><br/>On the other hand the constraints were a fantastic spur to my creativity. If I had not been in such a context I would never have designed the game at all <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
