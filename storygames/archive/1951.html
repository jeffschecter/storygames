                    Hey all, maybe it's the end of the year, or the fact that we're 11 months into this little project called "Story Games", but I've been reflective about the direction of this site (and even the concept of "Story Games" as a 'game type' or whatever). So bear with me, I'm not normally gonna be opening all these "heart to heart" threads regularly. :-)<br/><br/>But Matt brought up a good point in the Survey stickied thread, and I wanted to discuss it here.
<blockquote>I want to like it here, but it's too damn nice. I'm really, really not kidding.<br/><br/>There is no mechanism to be critical, because the moderation is "Hey, gang, play nice." I DO play nice and yet am not pleased with a handful of discussions I've participated in. I think the "dont' harsh anyone's buzz" vibe going around is ... annoying. As in: Counter the nicey-nice community in some way, and they'll not respond your ideas. I found this annyoing enough to take a breather from the forum altogether. I still don't read anywhere as much as I used to. I came back because I noticed that this forum was the No. 1 referrer to my web site. I've managed to read a handful of threads since, and post once. I think that sucks.<br/><br/>So, I'd love to see a bit more discussion and a bit less can't-we-all-just-get-along hippiness, because I think SG is becoming more of a comfort blanket and less a place in which valuable content develops to RPG hobbyists. But, really, I expect this to be met with "What-the-fuck-is-up-with-Snyder-this-year silence."</blockquote>
Here's my thoughts, and they're not from the Voice of the Commanding Moderator, but rather just one guy. So feel free to disagree publicly, there's nothing wrong and maybe some ideas will rub off:<br/><br/>First, let's look at why I created this place:<br/><br/>* I created this site initially to be kind of a lounge area of The Forge, but with the possibility to build bridges; to get folks in various camps (mainstream and indie; traditional systems vs wild/out-there systems; etc) to come in and relax. Basically, I created a place that would be a "Forge Birthday Forum" (which I love), but with a focus back more into chatting about gaming in a relaxed atmosphere.<br/><br/>* I never really imagined "valuable" content produced. I don't really like theory discussion where the rubber isn't meeting the road. Rather the content I imagined would be pretty unfocused general gaming discussion, with a pronounced focus on what's called "Craft": Basically tricks and tips to make individual gaming sessions better, to improve the experience for everyone at the table, to troubleshoot gaming issues and problems, and (which happens a lot here, and is awesome) discussions on cool ways to start/prep for/think about games and game systems.<br/><br/>So with that in mind, here's more of what I wanted out of the forum:<br/><br/>* I didn't want "fights". They're ugly to look at and hard to moderate. So, namecalling and all was right out.<br/><br/>* I wanted to emphasize the "cross-pollination of ideas" throughout this community (pretty much everyone is on board with "we like mainstream games; we like non-mainstream games or game ideas A Lot", but /within/ that view there's a huge breadth of views and ideas). In other words, to have a place where the likes of Chad Underkoffler could talk with the likes of Shreyas or J Walton without having to talk over/past each other. To create an environment that facilitates that, I had to:<br/>- Come right out and say 'please be lovey-dovey gentle, every idea is a bew-ti-ful flower that deserves to be nurtured' and make moderation actions when someone was forceful, domineering, or abrasive, or<br/>- Constantly monitor all discussions and make fine 'moderator action' adjustments to create this "zone" where there was a maximum of 'people talking the way they want to' vs 'keeping the environment up in a way that won't drive folks off'.<br/><br/>For me, the latter looked like a lot of work so I opted for the former. It's totally the sissy path, and because of it it prevents people from speaking as enthusiastically (or agressively in some cases) as they would want to, but it's the easiest way, and has worked pretty well thusfar.<br/><br/>In the last 11 months, we had a dustup or two (Push/Pull), but for the most part people have been civil, and whether out of respect or fear or whatever have generally refrained from publicly pushing each other's buttons. Some folks have left (publicly even), others just read posts and never post themselves.<br/><br/>...And yet, look at all the awesome discussions that have occurred. I'm always first to lend an ear to new ways of doing things (I outright beg folks for their ideas!), but I sure as hell want to point out the successes of the last year first.<br/><br/>I'm looking for more opinions on this matter, on any side. Feel free to reply.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            The only comment I have about the nice-ness is that I partially agree with Matt that it is hard to be critical if you are worried about stepping on toes and such.  I've always liked TonyLB's rule in his forums which is that you can attack any idea someone brings up using whatever language or method you prefer but you cannot attack the person at all... even if you're polite about it.<br/><br/>But that might not be what you want this forum to be about.  Perhaps you don't care if excellent critical analysis is going on.  If you are looking for a relaxing place to chat about games, then this site does that admirably and why change at all?                        </div>

                            I would like to post a disclaimer that I do like the boards the way they currently are.  I don't feel like they need to change.  If I want heated debate and pointed criticism, there are lots of places to do that.  Storygames doesn't have to be one of them.                        </div>

                            Story games is clearly insufficiently Muy Macho.<br/><br/>Seriously, the idea that civility and strong disagreement are somehow contradictory is pretty much patently disprovable.  Yes, it's more work to try to frame your objections in a fashion other than "Your ideas are hand carved from a pile of monkey shit, you festering anus" but the payoff is, to me, totally worth it.  The necessity of thinking about what you say makes for richer discussions.<br/><br/>I completely recognize that that means we _don't_ get the benefit of the small sandboxes, but why would we want to? Those sandboxes serve a different purpose, and I would consider it inappropriate to suggest that they become "nicer" places.<br/><br/>Now, Matt's a cool guy, and he's got good things to say, and his absence saddens me, but seriously, Andy, purely personally, this site is you.  I consider you a civil, friendly guy who is more interest in keeping channels open than in keeping optiosn closed, and I think Story Games reflects that ethos, and is better for it.  Far better than it would be as a place designed to cater to some aggregate of whims.<br/><br/>This is my opinion, sure, but it's also good practice.  The Zone of Mediocrity is what lies down the other path.<br/><br/>Now, if you, personally, decide one day that this place needs to become the Thunderdome, then that's a great fucking reason for that to happen.  But not before that.<br/><br/>There are enough places i can already go for dick-waving.  I'd rather keep it in my pants here.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            ...lets put it this way. <br/>I don't post on the forge...and I've haunted THEM for years.

I don't get attacked and flamed...and that's NICE.<br/><br/>Forums are a harsh means of communication...I LOVE critisism but I also Love how people are respectful here and make it clear that they are trying to be the devil's advocate...which is nice because then I can say "Bring it on!" and we all know it's for the best :P<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>...I don't just like Story-Games, I love story-games..and I've learned more in the past week and have been able to DO more in the past week, than I have in the past few years with Forge.

                            I have noticed a sort of softening of discussion lately, and not a "softening our razor-sharp blades of rhetoric" thing but more of a "softening into a little blobby pile of goo."  I think it's a couple things, but the number one culprit is, I think, a misinterpretation of the nicey-nice ethic that we started with.<br/><br/>One of the things that I love about story-games is that it's a bunch of people just talking about games.  Most of those people really and profoundly do not agree on a number of points, but in this forum that has never prevented them from, well, talking about games.  This place has been a forum of common ground, points of connection, and bridges, and I love it for that.  Most of the really productive conversations here have, in fact, been people from different gaming backgrounds comparing notes.<br/><br/>However, of late people have been getting a little more hands-off in regards to participating in discussions.  It's an important point to note that "playing nice" does not ever mean that you can't say, "I believe strongly in X."  It does not mean that you cannot take a strong position and defend it.  It just means you can't say, "I believe in X and if you don't, you're a moron."  That's lots of other forums, and it's bullshit.  But I have noticed that participants are taking fewer positions, saying less, and consequently contributing less.  Perhaps it's because people are being a little too careful, lest their "I believe in X" gets misconstrued for "and if you don't, you're a moron."<br/><br/>This forum was, for a good long time, a place where lots of people who believed different things about gaming came together to discuss gaming and what they believed.  We've kind of lost a little bit of that, and now it's a place where people come together and kind of talk about gaming tangentially, lest they take a strong position.  I would really, really like to see more folks standing up and representing what's important to them.  I think if we lose that, we lose the productivity that we've enjoyed for months.                        </div>

<p>I like this place as a social forum. I like being able to talk to people without worrying too much about someone being flamboyantly offended by an offhanded comment or by a poorly moderated troll.</p>
<p>I have learned that it isn't the place for critique. It sucks here when people get deep into theory, too, which seems to happen curiously often.</p>

                            Funny enough, I find Story Games nice in the way Canadians are nice. <br/><br/>Canadians,  for the record, are only nice in that they are mostly polite and non-aggressive. They are however, sarcastic, snide, and much given to a "Well we aren't better, but at least we're less-worst" type of non-smug superiority. Its also debatable about how nice it is to define yourself in terms of being NOT YOU. As in "I am Canadian because I'm not one of <i>yoooouuuu</i> Americans/English/French/Martians." <br/><br/>Or as in "I'm glad to be here on Story Games, among the right thinking people." <br/><br/>It's also significantly revealing where the nice-nice breaks down. Push/Pull, despite Andy's cite, was mostly just a heated theory debate that got a little hot under the collar and much as it may have been uncomfortable in the moment passed as such things pass. OTOH, I still look back on the reactions around the "Very Special Gender and Gaming" conversation with a wince.<br/><br/>And I have to wonder if its threads like that which have lead to the softening that Josh talks about.                        </div>

                            I kind of feel the same way - that SG is a little too kum-bah-yah for me - but I don't think of that as a flaw. SG has a niche, and it's a cool one. I love lurking here and every so often dropping a post on some innocuous thread. But it's not a "home on the internet" the way some communities are for some people, because I am always on my good behavior here. I don't let my hair down and tear things apart or blue-sky something.<br/><br/>My ideal is a community with the strong culture of inquiry and charitable reading of the Forge, but without the tight single vision and purpose - less a designer's workshop than an analytical lab where we vivisect games and gamers for fun and education. I have what's sometimes charitably referred to as an "academic temperament" which I think means "he loves to argue about minutiae." SG is not that - I'm not sure that's actually possible.<br/><br/>I don't consider the "niceness" of SG a flaw - it's just a reason why I'm not a more active participant.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Canadians,  for the record, are only nice in that they are mostly polite and non-aggressive.

Its also debatable about how nice it is to define yourself in terms of being NOT YOU. As in "I am Canadian because I'm not one of<i>yoooouuuu</i>Americans/English/French/Martians."<br/><br/>Or as in "I'm glad to be here on Story Games, among the right thinking people."</blockquote>
It's not just the Canadians, but yeah. There's a kind of undercurrent of pleasant righteousness that occasionally manifests as A Thread Where We Who Are Right Have A Ball And Laugh At The Poor Bastards, All In Good Fun. Not an unique symptom, though - it tends to surface in any community where there's a majority of roughly like-minded people.<br/><br/>The idelogies argue, not people - approach is a good one. SG would do well with a bit more ideological debate (wheter it's a small differene or a large one), where discussion would still stay in the ground and polite. The conflict/task -resolution -thread was a good one, lot's of different opinions and approaches, but without hostility.                        </div>

                            I like having a <i>nice</i> forum to go to.  I'm a member on many forums, including at least 15 just for RPGs.  Many of those I rarely log onto anymore, however, because the tone is unpleasant or the moderation arbitrary.  In fact, I stumbled upon Story Games because I was actively looking for a new forum that would be more congenial.<br/>
<br/>
If there's a reason my own contributions have remained so far pretty bland, it's that I still feel like saying something wrong will bring on snark or a flamewar I don't want to waste time with -- a reflex I acquired on these other boards.                        </div>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>I feel much the same. <br/><br/>Also possibly significant in that mushishness thing, a lot of folks who used to have strong dissenting opinions have dropped off to a greater or lesser degree. The Jessicas are pretty much absent these days, along with Bruce, Chad, and several others who never gelled with the greater group. So several of the voices that used to stand out the most strongly aren't present anymore. <br/><br/>Of course, this happens in any community. Over time the community decides who it is, and those that don't fit don't stay. (Usually, unless they're particularly obnoxious.) But that, I think comes to the central question that Matt brought up. It isn't really about how nice we are, its about if we want this place to be comfortably us (or at least NOT THEM) or if we want it to be a place where people with different voices can talk passionately. That sounds to me like what Matt is at, the increasing feeling that if you aren't in the central blob you aren't really welcome here because your statement of your ideas may not be nice enough. <br/><br/>I know that I'm also having issues around here of late. If I have a thought I want to explore I'll do it on Yud's Dice. If I want to talk about the portability of fun I'll do it on Snyder's blog. If I want to have a throw down about why system matters matters, I'll find you and we'll have a good old fashion fight. If I want to talk about fruit, or something that I already agree with most of the folks around here about (like, oh, that GM roles aren't set in stone) maybe I'll do that here. <br/><br/>So, the question is then -- is that what we want? Because Matt doesn't, but several other people clearly do. As for myself, I don't know. I think the friendly mass has a lot going for it -- as shutupgirl has shown. It just might not be the place I most wish it was. <br/><br/>But how much do my individual wishes count for? Am I doing that thing that gamers do when they think a game should be about something that the game was never supposed to be about, and get pissed because they didn't get the game they thought they wanted?                        </div>

                            If you want people to be brutal, say so..I'd like to think people HERE can do it respectfully.<br/><br/>Personally, I developed the "I'm not posting because I'll get flamed" reflext too, and honestly, I see alot of other forums as a chance for egotistical assholes to "zip, Thud" and try and prove how much smarter and better they are then everyone else...Which just turns me off because I don't need to feel as if I've "Won" everytime I post something.   I come here to learn, and interact...I don't need to feel as if I'm somehow feared, admired and held in awe...and I don't feel the need to put up with people who just want to look better than other people so act as if they are always right, never wrong and how everyone else is a retard and just isn't as good as they are.<br/><br/>...I like this board, it doesn't have the high school mentality of "I'm better than you", and that's what attracts me to it.   I don't feel as if everyone's trying to prove something to someone else.<br/><br/>As for Canadian...sounds to me like "Minnesota Nice"  Which is just slang for passive-aggressive.<br/><br/>We're polite, we're nice...but if you back us into a corner with a flaming pitchfork, we'll bite your head off or die trying.   Be a snob around us, and we might "accidently" insert sarcasm or snarky commentary..."                        </div>

                            Hell, the niceness was why I started psoting here.  I don't think niceness is quite the right word though.  It was more like, whatever anybody said, the reaction would be <i>positive</i>.  Not necessarily agreeing, but respectful and usually at least <i>building</i> on what was said.  And that's damn nifty.                        </div>

                            I don't think I'd use the word "nice" to describe this forum at all. I might call it Fluffy at times or passive-aggressive at others, but I don't think "nice" would ever really enter my vocabulary when describing it. I mean, if you go the comparison route, I suppose, as it feels like less of a boxing match than the Forge does, but that doesn't make it nice. I certainly have never felt the lounge-y comfortability that it was aimed to be.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not even saying that SG is a terrible bad place. It's certainly the only forum around that has managed to hold my attention even partially in all this time, but that said, I find myself checking in, and posting less and less, and that's not just because people aren't getting as passionate as they used to.<br/><br/>Part of it is that the community got a whole lot bigger, and so volume has reached a level too tiring for a lot of folks to keep up with. Part of it is that some of the brightest voices (to me) of SG have moved on or been edged out. But part of  it is, apart from the fluffy fun threads like My RPG Flaws, I have no idea where I am supposed to contribute. Despite the idea that this was supposed to be a forum...
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>with the possibility to build bridges; to get folks in various camps (mainstream and indie; traditional systems vs wild/out-there systems; etc) to come in and relax.</blockquote>
its a place where the majority of people come from one place and set the rules of discourse, and while I'm not even saying that's a terrible bad situation, it's not like the rules are really spelled out to guide those of us that don't come from that place. It reminds me of a <a href="http://lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=152" rel="nofollow">conversation I had with Vincent on anyway. a while ago</a> where we had to talk about the mode he wanted to talk about things in before getting on (or not getting on, in that case) to talk about the things he was trying to talk about.<br/><br/>An actual, serious question: outside of the fun fluffy, outside of con planning and the threads to read and the Essential fruit, what the heck am I supposed to talk about here?  What gets tagged as "theory talk" seems extremely arbitrary to me and often feels like a euphemism for "a discussion I don't like" or "investigation into an area of play I'm not interested in". I've seen some people on this thread right here who state that they don't like "theory talk" enjoy themselves immensely in threads that couldn't really be considered anything else, but get huffed about Theory Talk when others that more like communications theory or deeper game analysis get brought up.<br/><br/>And you know, since I've somehow become the poster child for the kind of thread that Should Never Happen Here Ever (even though I actually started the topic on my blog and had it dragged in here) is it any wonder that I'm confused as to what I'm allowed to talk about?                        </div>

                            OK. I'm confused. What's the complaint we're all talking about, here?<br/><br/>Because I've posted that Dice Roller thread, and got very good feedback (including Adam Dray posting a whole new user interface for my program. Which was very direct, and useful, criticism.).<br/><br/>And, on Jason's Business Solutions thread, I've told him several times that I think he'd made a mistake. And, on the Awesomify: Vampire thread, I've told Gaerik, fairly directly, that I think he's wrong.<br/><br/>So I don't understand. The "niceness" thing doesn't seem to stifle criticism.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Actually, here's a thing related to Joshua TunaCasserole's thing - if I disagree with something, something about the recent vibe around here makes me more likely to close the window than to get all oiled up and start word-wrestling with people.I'm not sure that's so good.</blockquote>
That is my feeling as well. <br/><br/>Part of it it, for me, is that I have a lot of bad webforum training that makes me go from 'I'm not sure I agree' to 'I am going to tear your idea to shreds with an uncharitable righteousness' very quickly. And I appreciate the friendly vibe here, so in general I try and err on the side of caution before posting. <br/><br/>But I can think of at least a few threads recently where I have disagreed with something, then moments later decided 'it's not worth it' -- the price of disagreeing seems to have gone up, somehow, at least for me. It may be the personal idiosyncracies I referred to, it may also be the feeling that disagreement has to be couched in an endless series of caveats. If I have to write five extra posts worth of words in order to contribute my two posts worth of opinion, that stops seeming like a fun thing to do.                        </div>

                            Graham, <br/><br/>Go read <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1844" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> and tell me what happened. <br/><br/>Why don't we talk so much about gender and gaming anymore? Why don't our threads on immersion always go so well? Why doesn't Bruce Baugh post here anymore? Why does Andy always talk about Push/Pull with a barely repressed shudder of horror? <br/><br/>Yes, there are good threads where good stuff happens. That doesn't mean all threads are good. And which threads go well for you, and which go poorly, has a lot to do with where you're coming to the game from. Those who come with some ideas already close to the general consensus, or move quickly towards it, or post thing about which the consensus doesn't matter, won't have the same problems as those who don't. <br/><br/>What are we talking about? We're talking about the experiences of people who aren't you, and just because you don't have a problem doesn't mean they don't. <br/><br/>Now if you care, or if you should care (because there isn't any inherent or moral reason for you to do so, despite the way it's possible to spin the rhetoric), is a different question. But just because things are working for you doesn't mean that there aren't other voices having trouble being heard, or respected -- or even just feeling like they're being heard or respected.                        </div>

                            Fred, <br/><br/>That's sort of the approach I take too. So far it's mostly worked. Just like it mostly worked on RPG.net.<br/><br/>But its also had me contributing less and less, and being less and less interested in the forum in general. Just like how it went down on RPG.net. <br/><br/>I also will bring things I care about a lot here less, as this becomes less the place for them. Just like... yea. <br/><br/>Notice how much I post on RPG.net these days?<br/><br/>Edit: Which isn't to say that I'm leaving Story Games anytime in the next decade. I don't see it getting that bad, as I mostly am in with the mass in a lot of areas. But its a reason why we've already lost others.                        </div>

Can I reasonably take from that statement that you think I've labeled people, and that this is not a good thing? Or, would it be more reasonable to assume that it's just a turn of phrase? Because I'm sitting here reading that again and again and failing to see how that's not some ugly passive agressive stuff.                        </div>

                            One recurring thing I'm hearing is that it's hard to get good criticism here.  It seems to me that this is the exactly wrong place to solicit criticism.  This isn't the place to make your game; this is the place to talk about gaming.  There are better and more appropriate places for workshopping games, whether that be the Forge, Collective Endeavor, your own blog, or a playtesting network.<br/><br/>I dunno, it seems straightforward to me that this just isn't the place for soliciting criticism.  Am I just limiting myself?                        </div>

Er... thing is, I honestly cannot look at that and say what that proves.<br/><br/>Should we be _nicer_ (So max would not have cause?) or does it illustrate that the current level of niceness keeps peopel from disagreeing (which it clearly doesn't) or maybe that th eniceness kept Max from expressing a rebuttal?<br/><br/>I dunno. Seems to more clearly illustrate that the niceness question isn't the question at all.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

<p>Ok, so why isn't he there anymore?  Was it because he didn't like Mike's post?  Was it because he decided that he doesn't like Story Games as a community?  Was it because he has finals and doesn't have time for posting right now?  Was it because his computer blew up and he doesn't have access anymore?</p>
<p>More directly, are you sure that he stopped posting because of something that happened here/there in that thread?</p>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>I think it's okay to get some kinds of criticism -- like, "Is this idea awesome enough for Vampire to rock!" or "how do these online dice work for you" or even "how do I market a game to people with tastes like yours." <br/><br/>But really, I think in a real way its a place to hang out and talk about fluff and have fun. Not a place to change people's minds, design a breakthrough game, or really get into it with people with radically different ideas. <br/><br/>All of which is cool, if that's what we want.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>One recurring thing I'm hearing is that it's hard to get good criticism here.  It seems to me that this is the exactly wrong place to solicit criticism.  This isn't the place to make your game; this is the place to talk about gaming.  There are better and more appropriate places for workshopping games, whether that be the Forge, Collective Endeavor, your own blog, or a playtesting network.<br/><br/>I dunno, it seems straightforward to me that this just isn't the place for soliciting criticism.  Am I just limiting myself?</blockquote>

                            Eric, <br/><br/>Yes, I'm really sure of it. He didn't like Mike's post, but even more he didn't find it worth the fight to talk on Storygames anymore. Blaming Mike would really be missing the point -- it was an issue where he finally just got tired of having to defend himself or explain himself rather than just talking about it. <br/><br/>I hope he'll be back someday, I was getting some real juice out of that thread, but right now he's a gone-o.                        </div>

Can I reasonably take from that statement that you think I've labeled people, and that this is not a good thing? Or, would it be more reasonable to assume that it's just a turn of phrase? Because I'm sitting here reading that again and again and failing to see how that's not some ugly passive agressive stuff.<br/><br/>Heh.  Not nice enough for you, then?
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>You are woefully misreading my points.</blockquote>
It's a reference to that.  By "You" you meant, at the very least, me, right?  So when I say something equivalent to "I'll put it simply, without bringing to bear my woeful misreadings", I'm staying in bounds.<br/><br/>It's neither passive-aggressive nor active-aggressive, dude.<br/><br/>Though, really -- QED on my point elsewhere about text being shit for being clear about whether something's merely assertive or actually aggressive.                        </div>

<p>Ok.  He got tired and left because he didn't want to defend himself anymore.  And so have some others.  Which is what you're driving at, right?</p>
<p>How does that relate to Story Games being "too nice" or "hippy" or "don't harsh my buzz"?  It seems contradictory to me.</p>

                            Eric, <br/><br/>As I've said multiple times and Matt has said several time now: <br/><br/>It isn't about being nice. Its about the fact that if you don't have a certain degree of compatibility to the main body of the "mush" then saying anything becomes difficult. Hush, hush, don't disagree with the consensus. If you don't, then you're starting trouble and not being nice and getting along with the good groove of the forum.                        </div>

<p>How does that relate to the thread you linked to?  It seems to me that the odd man out there was Mike.  You and Max were grooving, then Mike came in with a contrary point of view, then Max got upset and didn't come back.</p>

                            Eric, <br/><br/>It relates because Graham asked what kinds of problem we were talking about, he didn't see this as being a place where niceness stifled voices. To which my response was, condensed, "It doesn't stifle criticisms that fits with the nice mass of consensus. It does stifle views, critical or just self-declaratory, that don't. And one of the ways it does that is by quietly killing the urge to argue on such a nice forum." <br/><br/>Or to quote Daniel: <br/><br/>"But I can think of at least a few threads recently where I have disagreed with something, then moments later decided 'it's not worth it' -- the price of disagreeing seems to have gone up, somehow, at least for me. It may be the personal idiosyncracies I referred to, it may also be the feeling that disagreement has to be couched in an endless series of caveats. If I have to write five extra posts worth of words in order to contribute my two posts worth of opinion, that stops seeming like a fun thing to do."<br/><br/>Mike and I, in a real way (considering we're about a millimeter apart in how we play HQ, on the superhighway of RPGs) were the consensus voice. We were, as Rob says, the creamy middle.                        </div>

                            I also feel like Story Games is really only nice in a superficial, passive-aggressive Canadian sense.<br/><br/>I have a kind of love-hate relationship with what Story Games has become.  Recently it feels like we have a really interesting thread once a month at most and the rest is just socializing (with roleplaying as the main topic of discussion).  Often the most interesting thread is Things To Watch because more provocative stuff is being posted in individual blogs or in other places.<br/><br/>Like Brand, I miss some of the provocative voices who've bailed or started posting much less frequently: Jess Pease, Jessica Hammer, Mo herself, Matt Snyder, Kevin Allen Jr. and others.  That said, I've really appreciated Joshua BR, Jason Morningstar, the Evil Hat folks, and an occasionally snarky post by Jared ("Favorite Fruit"), because they tend to liven things up.  And there have recently been a few newcomers who've had a real positive effect.<br/><br/>It's hard to know why some people stop posting and some people start.  I do think there's a strong sense that Story Games is one of the key outposts of the Forge Diaspora.  Our discussion style is more comfortable than the Forge for some people but not comfortable enough for others.  I'm pretty comfortable both here and on the Forge so personally I have a hard time trying to promote a more open and welcoming style of discussion, because I've been pretty thoroughly socialized already.<br/><br/>In any case, I worry that efforts to try to alter the mode of conversation in any open online forum will have a similar degree of success as the occasional Forge revamps, which is to say: not much.  Unless those who post fairly often come together and make a concerted effort to change the style of conversation (assuming we can agree on what that should be) and encourage each other to maintain such changes, I don't know how to make things different than what they are.                        </div>

I stopped reading that thread, for pretty much this reason exactly.  Sara was looking for criticism, but this really isn't a place conducive to criticism, or at least the criticism I'm capable of giving.  There's no framework, no shared vocabulary, no foundation.  So when she'd say "system" I really had little idea what she meant.  That you were able to give her some criticism that she found valuable is great, and i'm not trying to discount that at all; I'm just saying that you were able to do something that the site isn't conducive for.                        </div>

                            Well, because niceness may be something of a red herring.<br/><br/>If the issue was purely niceness, then the problem would be that the limit on strong disagreement is that some people aren't willing or able to be civil in their disagreement.  We probably have some outliers for whom that is the case, but that's a really snotty assumption in general.<br/><br/>That said, there is a genuine (though of indeterminate size and consistency) issue of people feeling that this is not the forum for having certain types of conversations.  It has been _proposed_ (much the same way that niceness has) that there is gestalt idea of what the community feels is appropriate, and that it stifles communication that goes off the reservation, and since some people dig that kind of conversation, they are disenfranchised.<br/><br/>Now, note, I think this is about as spurious as the niceness.  The disenfranchised will, very naturally, feel excluded and by extension, persecuted or subject to a bias, but there's a real chicken and egg question - does this gestalt exist and is disenfranchising people, or do the people who don't feel they have a place (for some other reason) create an image of the gestalt to frame their own position?  I don't know, but I'm always skeptical of massminds.<br/><br/>Sadly, that leaves a problem (A perception that some topics are off limits or too much trouble) without a clear explanation, and we have only theories, some more charitable than others.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I'm pretty much with Sara/shutupgirl.  I'm really comfortable here.  I feel like I can discuss things and say, "Wait, please explain this, because I'm not getting it" without having to prove how big my gaming cock is, yet the depth and breadth of knowledge here is greater than in some of the more fluffy forums I've visited.  It's been a good happy medium between the intense "you'd better have done your reading" vibe of some forums, and the complete  lack of interest in the hows and whys of gaming I've encountered elsewhere.  <br/><br/>I think that no matter what the atmosphere of a forum is, there's always going to be stuff that I don't bring up just because I don't want to go there.  And there's always going to be stuff that comes up and all the people who've been on the forum for ages go, "Oh man, please don't even GO there, we've been down this road too many times already."  I don't see that as necessarily a bad thing -- it's just something that happens.  And that means some people are going to end up getting bored with it, because there's a discussion that they want to have that no one else wants to engage with them on, but, well, that's how things go.<br/><br/>(Edited to add: How many times can I use the word "go" in one post?  Many, apparently.)                        </div>

Those obstacles you cite entirely exist, yet despite them (or arguably because of them), we had a very productive and interesting exchange.<br/><br/>Those obstacles come from another place.  They come from an assumption that there is a shared language, and it is the shared language of that place, and without a buy-in to that language, there can be no expectation of criticism, or even meaningful communication.  The absence of that assumption gets rid of that framework, and forces us to do without.<br/><br/>Is that good or bad?  Entirely depends on your opinion of whether that framework is a scaffold or a cage.  Since I say "cage" it's probably unsurprising that I'm much more excited to enter into discussion without it.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Eric, <br/><br/>Yep, more or less. Plus there's just a "fighting the weight of it" issue going on. <br/><br/>You are, however, correct that there has been a lot of drift in this thread, mostly because we kind of had to figure out what Matt's original complaint was all about. So at this point there really are two components to my argument. Maybe another thread... but I'm a little tired at this point and think I've had my say. <br/><br/>And, for the record, I don't think SG sucks or anything. I'm part of the creamy mass of SG, but I do realize that, as Jonathan said, we kind of are what we are. I don't know if we can change SG to another thing without a lot of work, and I also think its pretty obvious that a lot of us don't want to. <br/><br/>Which, once again, is totally cool. People that are happy with it should be able to be happy with it. IF the happy mass is the majority (especially if Andy is in that mass) then Democracy wins and freedom sings. I just think that threads like this occasionally coming up is a good chance for us to check our own rhetoric about what we are and what we're doing. "Story Games: Happy!" is still cool, because it is. "StoryGames: For Everyone" doesn't seem to apply anymore. <br/><br/>But then, I don't know any community that's for everyone, so...                        </div>

If the Forge is steam, and RPG.net is ice, then story-games is like lukewarm water.<br/><br/>I think the coolest thing about SG is the raw blinding passion some of the folks here have for game play -- not game design, not game reading, not game advocacy, but game <b>play.</b>  The canonical SG thread, to me, is "We played X and IT WAS AWESOME."  I read those threads and then I want some of that awesome for myself.  That push towards awesomeness has done a ton for me, I think.<br/><br/>How "raw blinding passion for play" intersects "niceness," I dunno.  But I'm glad this place is here and I don't want it to lose that cheerleady aspect.                        </div>

Exactly.  <br/><br/>There are conversations.  <br/><br/>These conversations could have terminological rigor that would aid what some folks like to call "clarity".  On the Forge, using this rigor prevents your thread from getting rejected as not being based in the correct vocabulary or not founded in readings from the accepted "bibliography".<br/><br/>When conversations here have that rigor, I stop wanting to read them, and start really hoping folks will take them over to the Forge where they belong.<br/><br/>Here, I want to feel like I don't have to worry about whether or not my use of a word passes the I've-read-eighteen-fatiguing-essays-on-roleplaying-theory sniff test.                        </div>

<p>Ok.  Well, I'm glad that I finall got your meaning, Brand.</p>
<p>For my part, I think Story Games is awesome as-is.  It gets regular injections of awesome on a daily basis.  I've never logged in here and not found something I wanted to read.  I've never been apprehensive about posting in a thread or starting a thread.  I get to speak my mind here.  I think everyone gets to speak their mind here if they want to.  But if peeps are too afraid to speak their minds in public, for fear of what the community might say, then they <em>shouldn't</em> be speaking in public.  They should be off on their blogs.  People who are afraid to defend their point of view in this place don't add a damn thing to it.  Not any more than someone who's afraid of roller coasters adds to everyone's fun when they ride one.</p>
<p>So, if somone gets off the Story Games Ride and says "No more for me, thanks.", I don't find myself upset at all.  They'll have a better time somewhere else, and someone just as interesting will fill in the ranks to replace them soon enough.</p>
<p>March on, Story Games, march on.</p>

                            Eric, <br/><br/>Most of what you say I just nod at, but the part about being afraid to speak up. Sometimes it isn't about being afraid. Sometimes it's just about not liking it or not finding it worth it. <br/><br/>Much like I doubt you could say that Fred or Rob are "afraid" of the Forge or of speaking on the Forge. It isn't about any kind of weakness, meekness, or inability to have a fight. It's just about not finding it worth it because the place isn't going to work for you. <br/><br/>The problem then comes when folks have to figure out whether or not a place is for them, and if not why not. And how bitter they get about that is... well... variable.  There's folks whats have issues with the Forge doing to them what we're talking about SG doing to others now that still have some bitterness towards the Forge, but who probably don't have a problem with it now that its them doing the doing. <br/><br/>So if we can drop the "you're not strong enough to cut it here" angle, and just say, "If it isn't for you, it isn't because we don't want to change it" then I've got no problems with it. Because at that point we're being honest about what we're doing. We aren't making a place for all voices to talk hot to cold and everything in between, we're making a nice comfortable luke-warm bath for those who like the luke to warm in.                        </div>

                            Rob,
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Sadly, that leaves a problem (A perception that some topics are off limits or too much trouble) without a clear explanation, and we have only theories, some more charitable than others.</blockquote>
Is it a problem? I mean, I'm sure that people could debate all day about whether the gestalt exists or if there's just an image, and I doubt there's be a concrete answer, but it would remain an obstacle. The real question is, do we care if the disenfranchised feel disenfranchised? Does SG care if it loses voices?<br/><br/>I thought at one point it would, because of that "people from different camps" point, and it seems like it does to some people like Matt, who is looking for the kind of impassioned discussion that requires strongly different views.<br/><br/>Most often these days, and in discussions like these, I think that maybe the majority of SG doesn't care about losing voices, nor about the disenfranchised feeling disenfranchised. This doesn't even have to be a bad thing if it's done with frankness and intent. <br/><br/>I think the problem is that SG wants to be both: on one hand it wants to be open and inviting to new strains of thought where bridges can be built, on the other hand it doesn't want to make any room or concessions for those new people. <br/><br/>It's only disenfranchisement when people are given a right and then refused it.                        </div>

<p>Really?  Because I thought we were speaking exactly the same language.  And just disagreeing at a fundamental level.  You think that a lack of support means the same thing as driving away.  I think that people who don't find support naturally go looking for support somewhere else.  Which is different from being driven away.</p>

<em>But do not tell me that they cannot say what they want here.</em><br/><br/>Eric, nobody's said that people are <em>prevented</em> from saying what they want.  Brand and others have said, instead, that people <em>aren't</em> saying what they might want.  And they aren't saying those things because of subtle social pressures like disapproval or disinterest, things that are not quite being prevented from speaking.  The point isn't that all viewpoints should be allowed, the point is that all viewpoints are not being discussed.  Whether or not the viewpoints not being discussed are "afraid" or "pansies" or "disinterested" or whatever is pretty much tangential.<br/><br/>Point being: the end result here is that the forum is not a place where all viewpoints are discussed.  It is a forum where all viewpoints <strong>can</strong> be discussed, which is different.  The question is which one we want it to be.                        </div>

<p>Joshua,</p>
<p>Gotcha.  I agree.  Mostly.</p>
<p>But the forum can't be a place where all viewpoints are discussed.  It's not possible.  There's always going to be someone who doesn't want to discuss their viewpoint for whatever reason.  Therefore the question is moot.  This forum is the second and cannot be the first.</p>

                            Eric,<br/><br/>The question is how open do we want to make this forum for people to respond, or how much to we want to keep things like they are?<br/><br/>Your vote is obviously the latter. <br/><br/>Please note that calling a discussion moot on differing grounds is a rhetorical power play, and a dirty one at that. It's like saying: "Your vote don't count." It's not surprising that you don't agree on this point.<br/><br/>(Note: I got in an edited it, hoping to get it through before people refreshed, but as usual, my fingers were too slow. This post said: "Josh said "can" be discussed " before, but I realized that wasn't helpful or clear. Sorry for the discontinuity)                        </div>

                            Eric, there is also the possibility that this forum becomes a place where all viewpoints are <em>welcomed</em>, and I mean <em>actively welcomed</em>, not allowed to exist.  If membership in the community came with an assumption that when you heard about something you didn't know much about, you'd jump in and ask questions and find out more, to welcome people onto the forum and prompt them through subtle social effects to open up.  (Much like how the Forge's First Thoughts is supposed to work, and occasionally does.)                        </div>

                            I thought we were having a pretty good diversity of people gathered here.  I am always glad to see people like Jonathan and Elliot, with whom I've discussed things on personal blogs (like Jonathan's and John Kim's) but not in fora, because it seemed like we weren't participating in the same larger fora (I don't do RPG.net, for example, it's just too big for me).  I personally think that they and others that I don't see on the Forge or other fora I visit open up new perspectives for me.<br/><br/>Now, for some reason, not all people who tried to participate here have remained, and that sucks.  But I'm not sure that we as a community drove them out; it appears as though there might have been a couple of clashes between particular people.<br/><br/>Because honestly:  If there's some kind of "creamy center" paradigm here, I don't see it.  Looking at the threads, I find that:<br/><br/>We don't discourage traditional play.<br/><br/>We don't discourage indie play.<br/><br/>We don't discourage fringe ideas.<br/><br/>So what is it that's happening that drives people away?  And is there anything that can be done about occasional clashes of personality, or is there really some sort of paradigm at work that I'm just not seeing?                        </div>

                            Can I first say that I'm 16,000% behind Mo's initial post on this page?  That's like my feelings in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Story Games had the chance to be a place where people with really diverse views could come together to talk about roleplaying.  For a while, it really looked like it might happen.  But then it stopped heading down that road and became something else.  And that's what makes me sad, because that's what I, personally, really really wanted Story Games to be.  It's also what I want Push to be.  It's what I want out of a roleplaying community.  It's also different from what Andy wants for SG or what Levi wants for GameCraft.<br/><br/>Now, I suspect, to a certain degree, that some of that is just the inevitable result of socialization and Story Games developing an identity as a community instead of just being a forum where some stuff gets posted.  For example, GameCraft is pretty dern exciting right now but I expect that, in 6-8 months, it'll go through the same maturing process as SG and become significantly less exciting.  20x20, for example, became so much less exciting that nobody really posts there anymore.  But it was The Bomb when it was first getting started.<br/><br/>So yeah.                        </div>

<p>Jonathan,</p>
<p>You're obviously not alone in wanting SG to be the diverse views community.  I think it still can be.  But I think it's totally impossible for it to happen on it's own.  I think it's quite natural for the differing views to diverge from each other.  The Forgie view stays at the Forge, the SG view stays here, and the RPG.net view stays there.  Like you said, there's that maturing thing as the views on each site reach their equilibrium.</p>
<p>So, I think to break the equilibrium, the people who want the views here to be more diverse have to be the force for keeping the diversity.  You have to be the welcoming force.  You have to be the invitational force.  You have to be the 'please come back to Story Games'-force.  You have to do it because you are the one who wants it to happen.</p>
<p>I will not do it for you.  Neither will anyone else who's content with the statis quo.  But you knew that.  But what you may or may not have known is that, as a supporter of the statis quo, I also invite you to disrupt it.  If you want to shake things up, then go right ahead.  I'll still be here.  And I'm guessing that there are a few more folks like me around here that feel the same.</p>

                            Okay.  I've got to weigh in here a little.  If by "subtly discouraging" you mean "ignoring subjects I'm not interested in" I'm not sure I'm buying it.  Why should I feel compelled to actively encourage discussions I don't really care about or don't want to participate in?  I kinda like a certain amount of intellectual Darwinism.  If it isn't an idea that anyone thinks is cool enough to discuss then it dies from lack of interest.  That doesn't make me sad.  Why should it?<br/><br/>Edit:Crossposted with lots of people.... this thread is busy.  :-)                        </div>

                            This is the most awesomest thread ever.<br/><br/>It's no surprise to me that Brand and Mo have said what I might have said if I'd checked in two hours earlier, except more Canadianly (like in Metric, and with gravy on everything). Will you two adopt me?<br/><br/>The thing about this thread is that the discussion so far suggests to me that Story Games could be what Snyder and many others would like it to be. I mean, this thread is essentially the kind of stuff Snyder was wishing for, isn't it Snyder? <br/><br/>ISN'T IT?                        </div>

<blockquote>People have read this, right?<br/><br/>Just checkin'. </blockquote>
Hey, that's an excellent read. Thanks for the tip.<br/><br/>I think this part seems pretty germane right now:
<blockquote><br/>IRC channels and mailing lists are self-moderating with scale, because as the signal to noise ratio gets worse, people start to drop off, until it gets better, so people join, and so it gets worse. You get these sort of oscillating patterns. But it's self-correcting.<br/></blockquote>
I guess my observation is that the quality of threads lately has been a bit schizophrenic. I think some of this is due to a cycle-through of users, with old voices absent and a lot of new ones I haven't established any reputation for. I don't see any reason this is occurring outside the usual self-correcting pattern. I guess it's a little weird for an invite-only community.<br/><br/>Also, I sort of just assumed that the proponents of serious discourse on gender and push/pull and what not had been frightened away by the spree of owlbear worship, and things of that boyish ilk.                        </div>

                            This has been a rather long discussion with an interesting aside about Canadians. I feel that I should add that I don't think SG is "too nice". I think it's just right.<br/><br/>That said, every group has some people that push the limits a little bit. You've got to be able to roll with the punches. Rob, I've seen that you come on a little stronger than most of the people on SG. When you comment on a game of mine, I'll take your comments in the way they were intended because I've seen that you're an active member of the community and I've got enough sense to respect what you say. You'll probably find my mooshy hippy response annoying, but I figure you'll at least read it in return.<br/><br/>I've always avoided heavy participation in online discussion because I've learned that from disagreement to someone being called a nazi is usually a margin of about five posts. That doens't happen on SG, which is why I like it so much.<br/><br/>Yes, I think there has been a dip in quality lately, but I think it's because our membership has grown high enough that it's diluting the discussion (why are we talking about Canadians vs. Quebecois in this thread?). That's a result of success that is probably not going to change. I don't think it'll stop us from having productive conversations.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/><br/>So...............let me ask, "Andy, what the hell to do <b>you</b> want for Story Games?"  <br/><br/>In the end, that's what it boils down to.  This is Andy's site.  If he wants a coffee house chit-chat atmosphere, then that's what it'll be.  If he wants a place were ideas are put through the fire for purification and refining, then SG will become that.  That's the facts.<br/><br/>Now for the oppinon.  SG has never seemed to me to be a rigorous place for innovation in RPG design or play.  Push/Pull was the closest we ever got, and I don't think a single thing was ever really definitively decided from that.  I'll be strait-up honest.  I lost intersest and no one has followed up since with a consistent string of Actual Play posts or production of a game the exemplified those styles of play.  In general, there is very little accountability here.  There is no reason to back up an assertion with actual play, actual design, or a link to an origonal source.  Anyone is free to say something like, "VIncent said ____________" or "Ron said _________________" or "The Forge treats people like ____________" or whatever else without pointing to where that person actually said <i>that</i> thing.  Or by asserting that "People who play My Life With Master alway do ______________" without linking AP posts that show that.  But the thing is, it's not just up to Andy to hold people accountable.  Everyone has that job.  How often does someone call out somone else on a bullshit statement here?  Pause and think on that a moment.  <br/><br/>I'm going to say thanks to Nate P for the next part.  How much more do we use the word "awesome" now as compared to when SG got started?  Lots!  I mean, it got to the point one of the most notoriously genial guys in the Diaspora had to make a blog post about it.  And how does that really help someone?  As a newbie designer, if I had a choice between someone saying, "Dude, that's awesome!" or throwing the Big 3 in my face, I'd take the Big 3 hands down.  That will go a heckuva lot farther in helping design a better gam than a pat on the back ever will.  Recently, Mike, Jared and Paul have talked a lot about playtesting, refining, and accountability in design.  To me, the Ashcan conversations are the most useful threads that this site has had to date when it comes to furthering independant RPG design and production.  But when I read those threads, the tone and demeaner are jarring when compared to <i>My RPG Flaws</i> or <i>Give Me Some Essential (Fill in the blank).  </i><br/><br/>So here's the breakdown.  Story Games is, no doubt, part of the Forge Diaspora.  However, I do not feel that SG is carrying on the work of the Forge- which is definately <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>not to advance a specific theory</b></span> but instead to improve play, improve RPG design and provide help to creator-owned RPGs in hitting the market.  That does not mean it's a bad place or a useless place.  When it comes to just having some relaxing, low intensity conversations with some guys that enjoy the same hobby I do, this place is king!  <b>But</b> is that what Any wants for this place?  A smoking lounge to unwind in?  If so, cool!  If not, well... something will probably need to change.  Whatever Andy decides is what will happen.  He leads Story Games just as Ron leads the Forge and Levi leads GameCraft.  <br/><br/>So.  Andy.<br/><br/>-What do you want for SG?<br/><br/>-Where are we going with it?<br/><br/>-And what purpose will it serve?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Eric, I regularly attempt to encourage people to post on Story Games or ask folks why they don't feel comfortable here.  I had that exact conversation with Robert Ahrens last night in the middle of the street.  And he was like, "I feel like there's some underlining GNS assumptions here that I don't necessarily agree with and that make me less excited about posting."<br/><br/>And I recently had this conversation with Annie Rush:
<ul>AR: Storygames scared me off again. ^_^<br/> me: yeah, i figured as much. what was it? too many theory discussions? Mo bailed as well, even before India. and Jess Pease.<br/> AR: No, not designer friendly.<br/>me: how so? no talk about design projects?<br/>AR: Well, when the main mod says, "no, I didn't want this to be a design community", I kinda tucked my tail between my legs and slunk off.<br/>me: heh. well, that wasn't Andy's purpose for making SG. but you can't really hang on the Forge or RPGnet either<br/>AR: they scare me even more</ul>
It's very difficult for me to make other people be welcoming, especially if they're not interested.  I can seek out newcomers to Story Games and try to respond to them and encourage them to become part of conversations here, but that's about it.  And it's not like people are going to come here just to talk to me, plus I don't have the time to be the Story Games Welcoming Committee, y'know?  Story Games is cool and all, but it's not my project, it's Andy's project.<br/><br/>I suspect that diversity is not in one person or even a small group of people's power to make happen, unless they have the authority to set the terms of discussion, which I certainly don't.  The only way to set the terms of discussion is 1) as a group, or 2) as Andy.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mo</cite>Is it a problem? I mean, I'm sure that people could debate all day about whether the gestalt exists or if there's just an image, and I doubt there's be a concrete answer, but it would remain an obstacle. The real question is, do we care if the disenfranchised feel disenfranchised? Does SG care if it loses voices?</blockquote>
That's a fair question, and intellectually, I recognize there's a certain amount of natural self selection that occurs, and while some of it is regrettable, so long as it accompanies growth (as it has been) the loss is for the good.<br/><br/>But on some gut level, I feel diminished by the departure of each person who I enjoy speaking to, or whose input I find interesting.  Curse of the small group, I suppose.  And honestly, the absences leave me more likely to listen to the voices i don't know, since Story Games has certain grown beyond the scope of my comprehension, if only just barely, and is full of people for whom I have not even indirect context.<br/><br/>And that's scary and troubling.  Do these people even know _anything_?  Are they diminishing the place I enjoy?   And why is that little voice going "My social capital! My precious social capital! it's going awaaaaaaay!"?  We have, quite honestly, had a lot of people leave or diminish participation for these sorts of reasons - because the mass of people they _don't_ know makes it into a place they don't want it to be.  In my gut, I really understand that.<br/><br/>But it's also awesome.  I love the indie crowd.  The folks I met at Gencon and Dexcon are cool and awesome people, many of whom I can proudly call my friends, but they do not challenge me to look outside what I know the same way that this balanced uncertain does.<br/><br/>So is there really a problem? It genuinely beats the hell out of me.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

If that is actually true, I am going to buy some people drinks at Dreamation.  <br/><br/>I am far more used to beign the guy who warns "I'm going to say something mean," says it, and then have peopel look at me quizzically and say "That was your idea of mean?"

<p>It <em>is</em> Andy's project.  He sets the rules.  He dishes the cash.  It's his sandbox.</p>
<p>But I don't believe that asking Andy to make the place welcoming to every viewpoint that shows up will make that happen.  Not even if that's exactly what Andy wants.  No single community will ever be welcoming to every viewpoint.  Not ever.  And if an actively welcoming force like Jonathan can't overcome the unwelcome feeling that's naturally going to occurr, then I believe that there is simply no way to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>I don't advocate giving up on trying to overcome that unwelcome feeling.  Keep trying.  Maybe the voices that you want to be part of Story Games will give it another go.  But I'm willing to bet that if they find themselves getting comfortable here, that means that someone else is getting less comfortable because of it.  And then you'll have to start all over again to pull <em>those</em> voices back in.  It'll be hard and never ending.</p>
<p>And I think it's reasonable to assume that Andy is cool with that.  Until he says otherwise.</p>

                            Rob, I think you nailed it in your response to Mo.<br/><br/>Eric, I actually think that, if diversity was a real priority, there are concrete things you could do to make it more likely to occur.  I think saying "there's nothing we can do about it" isn't true at all.  But I agree about the inevitable turnover.<br/><br/>But then the real question is: if the people I want to talk to keep leaving and are not regularly replaced by new people that I also want to talk to, like Brand, Story Games stops being as good of a place for me.  Which is also fine.  But then the issue is, like Annie, I have nowhere to go.  I mean, let's be honest, part of the reason I spend so much time at Story Games is because I haven't found a better alternative.  I could create one, I suppose, but you can't keep doing that indefinitely, helping build a community and then leaving when it disappoints you.<br/><br/>So there's a line here: <b>When do you act to preserve what made you care about a community in the first place?  When do you leave for greener pastures?</b>  Because you don't want to leave too soon (you have to have some endurance to ride out the bumps that plague any community, especially on the internet), but you don't want to kick the dead horse when most everyone else has moved on either.<br/><br/>Edit: The answer here is probably, "Whenever you feel like it."                        </div>

                            The Annie Rush thing kind of kicks me in the nuts though, since it's the envelope case.  Annie is _not_ someone I can say I know, having met her only in passing, but I dig her games and I think she has a great perspective on stuff, so I'm losing out on someone who would be a twofer for me - an expansion of my world _and_ someone who I have a context for.  And on some level that's where the "What, to hell with the abstract, that just sucks" response kicks in.<br/><br/>Here's the weird thing for me.  Prior to this thread, if you had said to me that Story games is not a good place to discuss designing a game, I would have satred at you like you'd grown a third eye.  I had always sort of waved off Andy's concerns as a desire not to turn into The Forge, Mark II, but it never impacted my willingness to discuss things.  Honestly, I'm still comfortable with my interpretation, so I'm unlikely to stop, but the idea of being chilling to design...I am not yet sure how I'm gonna internalize that.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Just to through out my own anecdote about what S-G does for me.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't think I'm a part of a groupthink creamy center.  I'd join with the question as to where these people are.  I don't think there's anyone here with whom a share a wholesale philosophy of role playing.<br/><br/>Second, and more importantly, what philosophy I've developed has been strongly influenced by my time here.  I wouldn't have gotten where I am, in that regard without discussions I had with people here.<br/><br/>So, this S-G is groupthink hippydom claptrop is to my eyes mere bellyaching.  I'm guessing other people see it, but S-G does provide an open welcoming forum for those of differing opinions.<br/><br/>But!  I'll also say that there's been many a time I haven't posted something because it would be dis-agree-ful.  And that I perennially avoid posting bad opinion about other people's games, even though I think it ought to be said.<br/><br/>Here's my thought on the matter: if there's a behavior that's not jiving with what the designer wanted, shouldn't we be able to produce some awesome rules that'll encourage the good and weed out the bad?                        </div>

Well, if you want it, why don't you just start doing it?  <br/><br/>And then...There are some seem to want a place where you can show off how intelligent they think they are and assume that anyone worth listening to already understands what they are saying and the words that are being used...because if they were worth listening to, they'd know it already.   ...That's just bullshit, really.<br/><br/>Everyone has to start somewhere...and it's THAT kind of attitude that kept me in the dark about gaming for nearly ten years, and kept me from even trying to develop something substantial for nearly fifteen.  Chew on that for awhile...intelligence and inguinity isn't measured by how many words you know, that's just experience.<br/><br/>If there is a rut anywhere, it's that people get so used to their niches, that they don't want anyone to come along and poke a hole in the roof, nevermind if that roof might have been overdue for a make-over.<br/><br/>If I love anything the most about this forum, it's that for the most part...I don't feel as if I'm up against a brick wall of people who feel I have to prove something to them before they bother to talk to me about anything.<br/><br/>What's up with the looking down?<br/><br/>Just because someone doesn't have the special T-Shirt doesn't mean they are an idiot...and you should have patience with the people you are.   If you want to be an elitist snob, go play an MMORPG...<br/><br/>Otherwise, you're wasting your talent by sticking up your nose when you could be setting an example.<br/><br/>Now that I'm done ranting, (I'm not mad, just wanting to make a point to what I think is acceptable and not acceptable as an adult), I'll re-state what I said before and be blunt about it.<br/><br/>If someone asks for critism, then give to them.   Telling them that you're having trouble seeing how A would work with B, is one thing; telling someone that they are a retard for thinking A would work with B, is something entirely different.<br/><br/>We are not five years old...Everyone should understand the difference.<br/><br/>If you want a critique, ask for it, and demand brutality. <br/><br/>Brutal, does not equate to an asshole...if you're being an asshole, you need to step down and check yourself...<br/>because it's assholes, not critism that drives people away.   It's making people feel stupid if they might be wrong about something that makes people give up.<br/><br/>...I'll go back to being a chirpy little Minnesotan again...but I had to get that out!<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>And for note...I Love the casual part and the discussion and the theory...but there's alot of smart people who have alot of experience here too, so even if it wasn't intended to Also work on games, maybe it shouldn't be discouraged either?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>You have no idea how incrediably thrilled I am with the things I've learned while being able to just have a conversation about gaming, and whats more...things to do or NOT do with my own!<br/><br/>Yay? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Calling people on bullshit statements is exactly one of the things I was talking about, when I said that I often feel lately like it isn't worth it. About the only people who I feel comfortable calling on bullshit are those who know me enough not to worry if I am being excessively acerbic. The rest of the time the very idea of 'calling bullshit' in such a blunt way seems anathema to these forums. Maybe 'carefully disagreeing in a very enthusiastic and proactive sounding way'? I see some of that, for sure.<br/><br/>And yes, of course, they're Andy's forums. I don't see why that statement even needs to be made?                        </div>

                            EDIT: 1:02 AM. Just got back from gaming. Have training tomorrow early at work again... must sleep... I'm sorry for bringing up this topic only to not respond fairly, but I promise I'll have a lot to post in the next 24 hours or so. I even <i>took notes</i>.<br/><br/><b>Definition of Irony:</b> Not being able to respond in-depth to my satisfaction on a message board dedicated to gaming, <i>because I was too busy out gaming</i>. ;-)<br/><br/>I overestimated my stamina, and will definitely post more Fri night. Very briefly, the adage applies on the marvels of the human being's mind; to be able to hold contradictory viewpoints at the same time.  In short, I agree with everything (<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVERYTHING</span></b>) that has been said, to at least some degree, even the stuff that is contradictory. And damn, I really appreciate the thought (and time) people put into the discussion. I'll have some more in-depth thoughts tomorrow, including some possible proscriptions (or minor things to try out). I also thank folks for recognizing that it's my villa and all, but seriously that's off the table for now, with the idea that "Sure, I can do whatever I want. And I will. But what I really want for now is to get open feedback, no matter how critical. Such feedback will help me push for excellence and help me solidify my own ideas, and give me new viewpoints to consider".<br/><br/>Think of it as akin to those times where you as GM ask the players at your table, "So seriously, folks, what do you think of this game so far? The rules, setting, how I'm running it, your characters, the works... Lay it on me". You all have been doing so, and I appreciate it.<br/><br/>So sleep for now, and directed responses to about a dozen or so specific points I want to address tomorrow. Ciao!<br/><br/>Also, if you have more to say, the topic is still totally open for discussion and debate.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            The person I most agree with is Joshua, right up near the start of the thread.<br/><br/>Story Games used to be a place where we'd kick ideas around. There seem to be less idea threads now and more "Essential TV".<br/><br/>And I miss the threads that made me think. I miss Tony L-B kicking ideas around for Misery Bubblegum; I miss the Push-Pull thread. Sure, sometimes they got a bit too formal, but there was also good stuff there.<br/><br/>One of the reasons for this, I think, is that theory threads are often denigrated. I wonder if, in stopping talking about theory, we've stopped talking about ideas entirely.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>P.S. Brand, I agree with you about that thread and, by the way, I met Max in a pub last Saturday. Hah!                        </div>

                            From my POV, the site has shifted into something less compelling for me â€“ the content, as well as the tone. The zenith for me was sometime back May-ish, with the Impro book club, lots of little gamelets (Too much rock, D&amp;F, and other stuff) were being thrown together in a way that fit the lighter design groove this place was offering, discussions about varied and thoughtful topics such as the ones on gender and age lines, and elements of the Push-Pull megaconstruct (which I thought did generate some very interesting dialogue). Jess Hammer was here, Mo and Brand were posting tons, ditto JBR, TonyLB, the Morningstar and others [edit: oh! John Kim. I haven't seen him around much lately and his is a really good example of a voice that this place could really do with] who all really did post to say something, rather than post to belong (which, hell, Iâ€™ve been guilty of myself on many occasions). <br/><br/>Now, itâ€™s notable that at and following that point a lot of fractures emerged, and a lot of people were burnt by the community, or vice-versa. So perhaps the things that I valued about Story Games â€“ a coherent, principled approach to communication and, indeed, challenging of ideas about roleplaying <i>together with</i> a diversity of viewpoints seeding these discussions and making them manifold and fruitful â€“ were oppositional forces leading up to a big crunch.<br/><br/>Or, possibly, itâ€™s as much that the site has got a lot bigger, and this has diluted the things that, with some care, could have otherwise been preserved. Posting to belong seems to have become more commonplace â€“ and of course it would, for new members coming along and trying to jostle a place in a pre-existing community! You can see it in this thread.<br/><br/>And, correspondingly, older members (and I include myself here) have their own issues of wanting to maintain their ownership. I happen to believe these should trump the wants of those with less long-lived stakes â€“ but of course, I would, wouldnâ€™t I? <br/><br/>Iâ€™m neither that happy with the status quo, nor happy that continual expansion will make things better. Iâ€™d like to see more diversity, but not at the expense of making the signal so noisy that we canâ€™t all usefully converse, or worse, splinter into non-communicative packs a la rpgnet. I donâ€™t feel supporting diversity means greeting any new voice by telling them how awesome they are, but I do feel that civility is a prerequisite to decent dialogue.<br/><br/>Thereâ€™s still a ton of good stuff going on here (Iâ€™ve just looked at the front page, and I really mean that), but for me it doesnâ€™t whirr as it once did. Perhaps thereâ€™s no going back there â€“ and perhaps some of it is served better by other sites (Gamecraft does look promising). God, maybe this is all nostalgia running at an accelerated rate!<br/><br/>In terms of positive suggestions, perhaps things can be tightened by a new statement of purpose. More fruitful to my mind would be some more regular threads that shape the discourse , like the stuff to watch one; if Story Games is supposed to be all coffee-shop then a chatty â€˜Good moment this monthâ€™ thread would contribute to that tone, if play analysis is the emphasis then a â€˜Moment at your tableâ€™ one â€“ either would encourage spin-off threads/a sense of shared purpose that would guide the site.                        </div>

                            I'll just de-lurk for a moment...<br/><br/>It's the first time I've ever seen a discussion about users being too nice to each other... and I've lurked since the times of Usenet and Telnet and Gophers and BBSs!<br/><br/><i>Which, of course, wasn't THAT long ago...</i> :P<br/><br/>About craft/theory discussions... I see The Forge as a lab and SG as a lounge.<br/><br/>You can develop great things in the lab, but you are to follow strict guidelines and expose your work to the rigours of the minds there and their blunt honesty. You may also stay at the lounge and chat about that weird idea you had and what kind of chocolate or fruit you like the most (in fact, include chocolate and fruit as part of your stuff) and receive kind nudges and well-worded advise. The coolest part is, that the lab and the lounge aren't mutually exclusive - you can get from one to the other, no problem.<br/><br/>Maybe the people feeling held back, need to explore a little more where the real limits of this community are instead of stopping where they think those are.

I like all of you folks. I can't see who it is that's doing the wrong stuff. I'd like to give Matt the benefit of the doubt as some sort of conscience for the group. But, frankly Matt, you come up with some sort of objection to what's going on that boils down to "things aren't as great as perfect" every once in while and I can only go, "Wha?"<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if the world were left to people like me, things would fall apart. But, ironically, this thread seems to me to be the most socially damaging one I've seen so far. Everyone is out now to point out when it is that they don't feel like posting. Which is pretty much saying, "Hey, there's some assholes out there who make me uncomfortable."<br/>
<br/>
I, apparently, am blessed with either being dense, or repressed, or obtuse or thick skinned or something. Because I haven't seen anything here has made me feel one iota uncomfortable. Then again I don't feel uncomfortable at The Forge either, or even on RPG.net. But maybe that's because I've got a big ego.<br/>
<br/>
Let's talk about that word for a second, ego. There's a lot of people here saying that wanting clarity in discussions is "dick-waving" or wanting to show that one is more intelligent than another. Now I'll be the first to cop to the notion that I like to be thought of as intelligent. Yep, guilty. But, then, that's what being social is about, no? Getting approval from others? In a place for ideas like this one, isn't half the point that we're looking for some validation that we've got good thinking processes, that we've thought up somthing good?<br/>
<br/>
Isn't the question really more about whether or not you have to make somebody else feel bad to feel good yourself? That's what we're talking about here, right? That's the bad behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Thing is, I'm not seeing anyone doing it. Not even me. Though, by process of elimination, I can only assume that it is myself. Since I'm not seeing anyone else do it.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow this is the conclusion I always come to in these threads that Matt starts. And I usually comically apologize to everyone as a sort of obfuscatory zen lesson. But, hey, that could be seen as me trying to say that you're all not as smart as me, or very passive agressive. So I'm not going to apologize this time.<br/>
<br/>
I will reiterate the other thing that I usually say, however, which is that I'm probably not going to change substantially. I always say I'll try harder to be nice, but somehow I don't think that it does a lot of good. I don't think that people change a lot. Call that an excuse if you must, but it's an accurate observation of my own behavior at least.<br/>
<br/>
What I can do is to reassure everyone that if I'm misbehaving that I'd like to hear about what I'm doing to make your day less fun. Hopefully I can do something to rectify it. Becuse, as I said, I think you all are great people. I'd like to be a positive force.<br/>
<br/>
Like Matt, I'm from the midwest, and maybe our "nice" is so passive agressive that we can't even see it ourselves. But, then, as far as I can tell, Matt is a nice guy. Like he says, he's like one of the nicest people I've ever met (and so normal for a gamer it makes me wonder sometimes). But if I'm just nice-impaired or something, can't really see it, let me know what I'm missing. I think I can change on that level, in responding to individuals.<br/>
<br/>
These posts always sound a bit solipsistic to me, even perhaps a bit egotistical. To focus so on myself. But, again, the point is that I can't see anyone else doing anything wrong. So the only behavior I can think to try to modify is my own.<br/>
<br/>
In the end it's the only behavior I have any control over whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Let me go on a little more here with two examples recently: The first is the thread in which I criticized SotC claiming that I didn't like the fact that the FP engine isn't automatically engaged through basic play. Fred's response ended with "cope!" Now, what's ironic is that I didn't take it as a personal attack, or get the feeling that I shouldn't criticize here. In fact I took a serious look at what I think Fred was trying to say before the end of that response. I didn't reply further to that thread not for fear of some reprisal, but because I was just thinking about it. In some small way, in fact, the thread at the Forge named System Does Matter may have come about because of that (and, no Ron, I didn't lie to you on that thread when I said that it didn't come about because of some other dialogue, because it had been brewing for months before that, and I wasn't seeking some finality to Fred's thread through that one - I don't think that at the time of posting I even realized that Fred's thread may have had anything to do with it). The ironic part is that some other parties I know think that Fred and Rob are out of line in this sort of response.<br/>
<br/>
I think they're to humans, and good ones. Which means we're going to disagree at times.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that I envision myself sitting at The Forge booth with Fred, and having the same conversation, and his "cope!" comes off as "consider what I've said and that it might not be as troublesome in play as you think." Perhaps I have the benefit of having met Fred, but I'd like to think that even just long association with them online would have me trusting him. Since I trust them, I know that they're objections, no matter how strident sounding, aren't meant to hurt me.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I'm quite sure that I annoy Fred and Rob to some extent. I certainly waffle between being FATE's biggest critic and fan simultaneously. I have high standards for it, because I think it has lots of potential. But I can understand if, at times, that it might seem that I've taken too much interest in how it's designed.<br/>
<br/>
I really should just design the game I want to see.<br/>
<br/>
I could apologize to those guys, but actually that would be insulting the tolerance that they've shown me - they understand me pretty well, I think. If I'm mistaken, then , again, hopefully they'll let me know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The second example that I can cite here is that I recently whispered something to Sara that she might have taken as me browbeating her. Sara, if that's the case, let me know. I think you're an asset to the board here, and would no more want to make things uncomfortable for you than for anyone else. Not my objective in the slightest.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, however, people are going to disagree. And it has to be OK for them to debate their points. My violation, if any, is not in debating, but perhaps in using big blunt objects to do so at times. I post a lot, so I take shortcuts. Not an excuse, just an explanation. I humbly ask that you try to take that into consideration when judging my tone. You shouldn't have to, but I'm asking anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One last point: "famous" designers, and that actually includes Annie Rush strangely, just because of her association with Jared (and, well, talent), Bruce Baugh, of course, etc, have a harder time than most. Because they have to worry that things being aimed at them are being done so to "knock off the big guy." They want to be just like the rest of us, but can't unfortunately, because of their position. This added stress makes it harder for them to be public anywhere. Greg Stafford still pokes his head out into the light of day boldly, but that's despite having weathered unbelievable torment online in the past. So if some "persona" like this disappears, consider that it's not neccessarily anyone's fault.<br/>
<br/>
But if you do see them, be extra careful if you want them to stay around. That doesn't mean you have to act the toady, just make your queries clear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, to wrap up...I love you guys. That's the important part. Is any of the rest of this insurmountable? I think not. As The Who say, "This is no social crisis, it's just another tricky day for you."<br/>

                            everyone's talking about how nobody gets into big, brawling contentious debate anymore, and this makes them sad.<br/>
<br/>
And at the same time, it also makes them sad that "outside voices" feel too smothered to post contentious ideas.<br/>
<br/>
So, what I'm taking away from this is:<br/>
1. Some people want to argue about gaming, probably from a high theoretical altitude<br/>
2. But they don't want to argue with the same people they've been arguing with for years<br/>
3. So, they want fresh new perspectives to argue with!<br/>
4. Fresh new perspectives should be argued with, challenged, attacked, and vigorously defended.<br/>
5. Fresh new perspectives, we give you a come-hither glance!  Also, ya wanna fight?<br/>
<br/>
And I'm wondering:<br/>
Hell, it's freaking role-playing games.  What's there to fight about?  I mean, to me, a good argument about theoretical gaming has to be...<br/>
<br/>
*  sufficiently grounded in AP that it isn't ten differet gasbags out-gassing in ten different directions--there should be at least some concrete referent<br/>
<br/>
* ought to have enough of a common vocabulary that it isn't sixty different, well-meaning people quibbling over terminology<br/>
<br/>
* stuff that the majority of the participants kind of understand, but not quite, so that the sheer act of discussing it is helpful as it refines thought<br/>
<br/>
(I think there are several reasons why it would be hard to get all three of these aligned, particularly with the stated desire for "fresh new perspectives.")<br/>
<br/>
But seriously--if you want to fight about some theoretical thing, ask yourself: <b>"What don't I understand yet?"</b>  And odds are, someone else doesn't know, and then you can work it out.  Like, waiting for fresh blood to wander in here by accident doesn't seem like the most effective strategy for thrashing out unanswered questions.  The best way to thrash out unanswered questions is to ask them.                        </div>

                            I have never felt discouraged from posting that I think the Big Model is mostly hooey, taking a giant shit on other Forge theories and saying Vampire's a fucking cool game and it never brain damaged anyone. I'm a traditional gamer and I love playing and running "indie" games and I don't see much of a line between the two no matter how much people pull at their hair as hard as they can and open their eyes as wide as they can and scream "BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT!!!" I like story-games. Probably nobody gives a crap if I'm here or not, but I like it.<br>

In other words, I am the rotten carrot at the bottom of the story-games peach cobbler and I'm perfectly okay with that.                        </br></br></div>

I'm much more likely to give something real thought and a careful answer if I've got reason to believe there's someone listening on the other end of the conversation.                        </div>

<br>
I feel ya, I get the same way once the Forge/SGers dive into theory that makes me wonder how the hell I ever had fun playing DnD and Champions and Cyberpunk and Traveller since High School, never mind why I am getting a kick out of Etherscope (d20 OGL Goodman Games) because of the setting, content, ideas, and possibilities and the 1-1 OpenRPG Gaming I am doing in it...makes me wonder how we all got along and had fuin rolling dice when conflict arose and inbetwen it was a bunch fo guys developing our characters, running around, doing stuff, seeing sights, making merchant empires, etc. All those sorts of things, or the huge 3 and 4 separate superhero campaigns where characters bled from one to another and we all worked off of the different plots and goals and actions of each other...                        </br></br></div>

                            Damn, turn you back for a few days around here...<br><br>This has definitely been food for thought.  When I first read Andy's post, I was like "of course, nothing's wrong with nice...I like nice."  (of course, my mom's candian [gasp, her mother's quebecois!] and I like to think I have acquired an earnest sweet temperament from her, so that itself may be telling).<br><br>Then I started to digest the ensuing post and realized I'm actually one of the people who has steadily decreased my posting and time spent here.  Which set me to thinking why that was.  I definitely miss some of the sustained 'ideological' (for lack of a better term at the moment) that showed up on the forum when I first signed on.  I did see and hear a lot of voices there which I hadn't been hearing, voices of people who seemed to be, even when of different opinions, 'my kind of people.'<br><br>[Who are those people?  Good question, I'm not entirely sure, but I think a lot of them were a certain sort of liberal arts educated humanist types.  It would be interesting to try and track that back.]<br><br>Of course, I also really enjoy sincere disagreement since that is where I feel I learn the most about others.  I care less about getting everyone to agree, unless it is about how important it is to have and sustain disagreements.  Although, that 'golden age' of disagreement was never golden--it was accompanied by a lot of real interpersonal tensions.  C'est la vie, although I have some pretty strong feelings about why that doesn't have to be the case.  I'm a weird mongrel that way--I can be a total bulldog on intellectual matters, but socially I'm all about the care of the person.<br><br>There definitely came a time when I started caring less about posting--where I would begin to write a post and just stop, and that came out of a pretty clear sense that it wouldn't much matter, that no real minds were going to be changed.<br><br>All that said, I sort of feel like story games is already in the middle of a change.  We defintely have gotten large enough that you can more easily be selectively apathetic, picking and choosing.  Which is why, I suspect, folks like Sara who have exploded more recently into the forum are having a good time, albeit a different one than the one I had.  She isn't going to run into the sort of kerfluffles that drove some people away because, well, more people are just willing to self-select out of discussions, whereas before they were more willing to dive in, for good or for ill.<br><br>I think there may be less and less of a central 'blob' of any real sort and a growing set of distinct blobs.  Maybe that is a touch clique-ish, but it doesn't have the same social force as a clique, is still more permeable...I have some hope for it ; )<br><br>Story Games is clearly not the Forge lounge and is its own thing.  I'm not opposed to that thing and, honestly, am a little curious to see what that thing is.  I'm sure not done coming here.  Whatever it is, maybe 'nice' is part of it, maybe it is just symptomatic of structural changes in the lifetime of this forum, a point in a process that isn't complete yet.  I'm down with taking that 'nice' and running with it a little, seeing what it becomes next.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

(Ian, this isn't really a response to you as much as I'm using you as a springboard, so please don't feel targetted.)<br><br>For me at least, this is a core part of what I come to story-games for.  I <em>don't</em> come here to change minds.  Like, at all.  I come here to see what other people think, and to hear about other people's experiences.  Since I come here for that, the least I can do is provide what I think and what I've experienced.  But seriously, I don't think I've posted here with the goal of "changing minds" for a while.  (Possible exception: getting publishers to think about their product as well as their design; my own personal hobby horse.)  The vibe here has been <em>sharing</em> rather than convincing, and I think that's kind of dropped off of late.                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Here's the weird thing for me. Prior to this thread, if you had said to me that Story games is not a good place to discuss designing a game, I would have stared at you like you'd grown a third eye. I had always sort of waved off Andy's concerns as a desire not to turn into The Forge, Mark II, but it never impacted my willingness to discuss things. Honestly, I'm still comfortable with my interpretation, so I'm unlikely to stop, but the idea of being chilling to design...I am not yet sure how I'm gonna internalize that.</blockquote>
Back in the day, I had been hoping that SG would be a place that was open -- hm, <i>protected</i> might be a better term -- for <b>non-Forge<i></i></b> design, craft, analysis, and enjoyment/banter purposes.<br><br>Because I personally do not design or perform analysis the way the Forge crowd seems to, despite liking many of the end products of their processes. <br><br>And, frankly, at this point in my career and play, I could give a crap less about <i>theory</i> -- what I want to hear about is <b>craft</b>.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>One last point: "famous" designers, and that actually includes Annie Rush strangely, just because of her association with Jared (and, well, talent), Bruce Baugh, of course, etc, have a harder time than most. Because they have to worry that things being aimed at them are being done so to "knock off the big guy." They want to be just like the rest of us, but can't unfortunately, because of their position. This added stress makes it harder for them to be public anywhere. Greg Stafford still pokes his head out into the light of day boldly, but that's despite having weathered unbelievable torment online in the past. So if some "persona" like this disappears, consider that it's not neccessarily anyone's fault.<br><br>But if you do see them, be extra careful if you want them to stay around. That doesn't mean you have to act the toady, just make your queries clear.</br></br></blockquote>
Well, I'm not a famous designer, by any means, but I'll accept "established" designer as a title before diving into a point.<br><br>Personally:<br>* I like blunt critique, both good and bad, so long as it's honest and insightful.<br>* I love chatting about lots of things about gaming, but have a few topics (deep theory using Crazy Moon Language without referent to craft) that I don't like to talk about.<br/>* I <b>hate</b> having my skills, knowledge, experiences, and body of work disregarded or outright ignored.<br/>* I don't want toadying, but I enjoy recognition.<br/><br/>In short, what I expect out of discussion about something is when I say about a design or play problem, "Here's a similiar situation that came up in a game I played in" or "Here's a way I got around that when designing Game X," is that people say, "okay, that's a valid and interesting point worthy of thought." After that, they can agree or disagree or analyze my solution, and that's all good.<br/><br/>But that's me.<br/><br/>CU                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I want any and all theory discussions to begin as if the particpants are reasonably-bright ninth graders, trapped on a long bus ride without having access to the internet, cellphones, or reference books. The vocabulary and complexity level can rise to reasonably-bright college students by the end of the conversation.<br/><br/>All terms/jargon/phrases that have specific meanings that are not necessarily alongside that word or term in a collegiate dictionary must be defined within the conversation. Every time. (Therefore, <i>zeitgiest</i> is okay, but <i>never formation</i> ain't.)<br/><br/>Any and all debate should aim for forensics competition aloofness.<br/><br/>If an opposing argument sounds wrong, check to make sure YOU THE LISTENER aren't the stupid one before you call someone else stupid.<br/><br/>Lastly, Chad is always right, except when he's wrong.<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>That is, if I ran the zoo.<br/><br/>CU                        </div>

I love that stuff (if it's done in a welcoming fashion rather than a vindictive one, which I trust that you would do).

Open the thread. Trust us a little more, and trust yourself. Yeah, you <i>can</i> decide in advance that bad things are gonna happen to that trust, and you won't always be wrong, but still, that's no way to live life.<br/><br/>People who don't wanna see design happen here?

                            The weird thing is that I feel like there's not a lot of difference between talking about "how to play" and talking about design or gamecraft.  I suspect that what Andy wanted to avoid was a lot of threads where people begged others to give them feedback on their half-baked design ideas.  And I agree.  Those often blow chunks (no offense meant to Sara's recent thread along those lines).  If people ask me to read through 10,000 words of stuff that they admit may not really have its act together... I yawn and look for another post.<br/><br/>But I think if people are doing design work and can offer it not as "this batch of mechanics and pages of setting and char creation stuff I'm developing for this very specific project, which is otherwise not of interest to anyone" but more like "here's this very specific and isolated new design/play technique I've been messing with, which could be more broadly useful in these ways"... I think that would rock.  That expands our working vocabulary of "how to play."<br/><br/>Honestly, I've wanted to start a few threads about specific mechanical or structural ideas I've stumbled across while working on the Exalted Hack (including a bunch that I've rejected as wrong for that specific project).  And I suspect SG is the right place to post isolated mechanical or play suggestions, just not giant chunks of game text or half-baked ideas that you want people to sort through.                        </div>

                            I'd like to note that, in addition to Bruce Baugh, Pease, what have you not hanging out here, none of the Forge designers spend a lot of time here, either.  The "lounge for Forgies" goal has basically failed.<br/><br/>Here's my why: The place is frankly boring me, these days.  There are awesome threads from time to time, but a large chunk of it seems to be rehashing hoary old theory points from the Forge or random in-joking, neither of which appeal to me.  I have no problem with a community existing which is full of re-hashing hoary old theory points from the Forge and in-jokes, I just don't really want to be a part of it.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

You don't need to get defensive, even with smilies.  I'm totally cool with people being comfortable at one site and not another.<br/><br/>These days, I'm mostly here for the "threads to watch" threads and a few others.  Otherwise, I feel blocked out by a wall of people going "we don't want you here because you might challenge someone's implicitly held beliefs."  I wish that that wasn't the case, and it wasn't always that way, and I feel sad about that.  If Andy posts and says "yeah, I thought about that, and fuck you guys" then I'll be on my way.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shutupgirl</cite>There is an overwhelming sense from certain individuals that this forum is considered "Gradeschool and vanilla" Because not everything has that is said has to be in the language of developers, or make your brain tingle with the buzz of complex mechanics.

Agreed. This has struck me as one of the greatest ironies in this thread, where talk of the forum not being welcoming enough is mixed with more than one person apparently complaining that the level of discourse on SG has reached a point where it isn't interesting enough (because of some sort of happy-nice groupthink or something) to make it worth their while to participate.  Personally, I'd love to see some hardcore design/theory threads mixed in with the other discussions that make SG enjoyable, but I get the sense that some peope are saying that because I and some other SGers won't then join in the discussions in those threads (as opposed to just reading them) it's not worth their time to start them.  Or that there's been a sort of brain drain, because some people had ideas of what Story Games might be that didn't end up coming to pass, that makes it no longer worthwhile to bother starting the deeper discussions.  That to me seems to be drifting toward a sort of elitism that doesn't seem to mesh at all well with the idea of this being a welcoming community in general, and instead seems to want to be welcoming only to a certain sort.                        </div>

                            -prhasing things a bit better, so they dont' get misunderstood-<br/><br/>It was a bit of a callout, yes.   I'm simply pointing out a reminder that blanket statements aren't something that is fair to make, because you insinuate that if we post here, we're not forge designers, and if we don't post on the forge, we aren't forgies...  (I'm assuming you meant the people who post development things on forge, not the actual creaters of forge)   Placing levels is like discriminating on basis of what you think is 'good enough' and that doesn't seem very fair at all.<br/><br/>It has nothing to do with comfort, it has to do with making statements that are opinion and intentionally or accidently act as if they are speaking for everyone.

It isn't telling you to leave at all, just saying, well...are you just going to complain about it, or are you going to do something about it?   Again, not meant in a condesending way, but sort of as a prompt.   It's always the first question I try to ask when I don't like something and want to say something, is if I'm just part of the problem or if I'm even trying to make a solution.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's easy to forget, and I've been guilty of that myself.                        </div>

No targeting felt:).  Actually, you probably captured something I was trying to express better than I was able to.  I was less interested in changing minds than sharing, sharing in the sense that there is reciprocal movement to consider and adjust to each other's insights.  Still, one really good way to share, at least in my mind, is through reciprocal reformulation of the discussion, the give and take of views well-stated being better-stated by reference to each other.  <br><br>I think at some point, I felt that became less and less an element of the experience here.  Which, again, isn't to badmouth the experience that is here now.  And, hey, it isn't to say that I can't start a thread with that as an explicit goal, right up front, asking people to join in with me.  If nothing else, this whole thread has made me think very consciously about how to frame the sort of discussions I want to be having about roleplaying.                        </br></br></div>

                            Okay, so a lot of people here seem to have an idea of the sort of threads they want to see at story-games.<br><br/>A number of folks have made the entirely valid point that story-games will be what it will be largely regardless of official pronouncements and such.  Even Andy agrees with tis at least to some extent.<br/><br/>So one can easily conclude that Story Games is woven from the threads we choose to post in it.  Right?<br/><br/>I think we've pretty much said what *needs* to be said, here.  The various points of view are out there.  They're said.  160 posts seems like enough.<br/><br/>But we're stitchin' and bitchin' with *this* thread instead of weaving other ones, now.<br/><br/>Well, we know what we want Story Games to be.<br/><br/>So... get out there and start a thread of the kind you want to see, here.  See how it gets woven by others.  <br/><br/>That's how we'll see.  That's how we'll know what we are.<br/><br/>I know that I like to talk about: some self-directed promotion, some elements of indie marketing, sightings of relevant conversations elsewhere on the web, ideas for cool shit to do at conventions, conventions I should be going to, the occasional light chatter about design concepts, and some deep delving on specific ideas, be they elaborations of existing game concepts or "rock the boat" ideas like building your roleplaying game entirely out of components from pottery barn.<br/><br/>I tend to start (and participate in) those threads.  Thus, part of the Story-Games tapestry is mine.<br/><br/>I like what I see.<br/><br/>Come, do the same for yourself.                        </br></div>

A lounge is somewhere people are relaxed and comfortable enough to talk.<br/><br/>So, to use an example...I might sit all day in a long meeting in my suit and not say a single thing, but at the end of the day, when we all go to the bar, I might get rid fo the suit, and talk about some of the same things at the meeting, or we could just end up talking about sports.<br/><br/>Consider the Forge the meeting and SG, The Bar.<br/><br/>So what you consider a failure, I guess I just don't see as one.                        </div>

                            I guess I'm not clear what kinds of conversations Ben, Matt, Chad and everyone else wants to be having.  Or what prevents them from having it here, other than ennui.<br/>

1.  What do the people who aren't so interested in talking here anymore, want to talk about?<br/>
2.  Let's talk about that!<br/>

                            Fred, good point about the "asshole" statement. I'm fully willing to stand corrected there. Because if, in fact, all people here are saying is that there are some topic they don't like...then I'm really not seeing any problem at all. Rather not one that can be solved. If you can find a place with this many people where nobody wants to talk about something you dislike talking about, I'd be real surprised.<br/>
<br/>
So I agree with your last post 100%. If you have an idea of what would be cool, folks, do like Fred says, and post!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chad, you are, yes, one of those sorta "famous" people that I was talking about. Thanks for clarifying the experience in question in terms of what makes somebody in your situation feel comfortable or uncomfortable. That's precisely what I was trying inadequately to describe.<br/>

Does that distinction matter?  *Clearly* the Forge is not a place for "hanging out".  There's too much rigor in the conversation for that.  So the only thing worth looking at is the former option.  Which, y'know, is why I'm here.  I don't want rigor; I want groovy chats.                        </div>

                            Alright, I've tried to start a reply post like four times now but, honestly, there's just too much to keep track of going down.  <br/><br/>OK, here's my thoughts, and I'm coming in from an angle of the board's creator of course, but also from a participant and a patient observer.<br/><br/>This was a cool thread.  I actually tend to do the same thing at work, which is schedule a meeting with the folks on my team without a manager present, where we air all the bad things (mostly) and good things; we write them down, discuss what can be done about them (if anything) then act on them if needed. In that same way, a lot of folks here even started suggesting great ways to avoid problematic behaviors. This thread turned into that kind of discussion. At a great time, too, being the end of the year and all that. It's gotten me into thinking more about what I want to do, implement going forward and the like. <br/><br/>Thanks again for all your comments (the article rocked, too). I don't spend a ton of time wallowing in self-reflection, but every once in a while it's good to know what folks are thinking,and see what shakes loose.<br/><br/>I'm going to have to throw out thoughts in random chunks, sorry about the disorganized mess.<br/><br/>Comfort vs "Nice":<br/>Some people have left Story Games. Sure, I wish everyone would find it nice to stay around indefinitely, contributing as they see fit. On the other hand, I understand the way things work: Some poeple will for whatever reason move on: The site doesn't meet what they're looking for; People get busy; etc. That's natural, a product of any community. Here's an issue, though:<br/>There's a lot of folks wanting to expression passion; They want to make passionate arguments, to put their beliefs up for critique and to be critiqued. That's what they need to feel more interested in the site. Not doing so will cause them to leave. That rocks, and I understand it; also, as an aside, I've never said "Don't put your heart out there", my attitude is "Don't be a dick when someone else does".<br/>Anyway, some folks have left. The folks that left vocally did so because they felt uncomfortable: The goals or views of the folks posting in some thread or other didn't match their own (even though everyone was following the "civil letter of the law", albeit with the typical internet medium communication foibles like "talking past each other", "misreading/misinterpretation", etc), and they took off. The what one person loves another hates, and that can't be stopped.<br/><br/>A dilemma, but I'm favoring passion over no passion.  I'll reword the rules to reflect it eventually. Part of my Lounge Mix idea was to be a bridge for a bunch of folks in all communities to throw down. So to that end, I want to make an environment where people are free to say what they feel, debate it if they want, and say "hands off" when they don't. That's the way to get folks rubbing ideas off on each other.<br/><br/>I like the idea behind "You can attack ideas, but not people".  Rarely have I seen it work well: In mixed communities that usually becomes the area of misinterpretation passive-aggressive bickering, etc. But there's no good way to police it in a way that covers all angles and doesn't require me to be online here 24/7. So I'll be thinking of a way to try to state something in the rules thread that:<br/>* Encourages excellent/right speech.<br/>* Allows folks to argue with points if the wish (note: I never said it couldn't happen before, I just always said "be nice about it". It just turned out that what was one person's intensive inquiry is another person's attack)<br/>* Encourages folks to think about what they read and the language they use to reply. (tie again to excellent speech)<br/>* Put the above in practical terms: I'm still gonna say "don't fuck with the zen", but I'm going to discuss in more practical details what that <i>actually means</i>.<br/><br/>If after this, someone still feels the need to vocally exile themselves because a few people didn't share their ideas, and they can't recognize the people that others do share their ideas, or still find the environment not to their liking, then there's little I can do other than say good luck and encourage them to create their own community.<br/><br/>So, if nothing else I'm going to encourage the kind of environment where people don't think that I'm (or 'the site') is out to cock-block potentially 'deep' discussion (as Shreyas said, leave the ring in the corner if people want to go word-wrestle), but at the same time encourage people to treat people like people.<br/><br/>I don't want some sort of vapid, empty milquetoast "Nice" generality to get in the way of discussion. And at the same time, I want people who read that, go "YEAH!!!", and start to suit up into their word wrestling suits to think about what they fucking write.<br/><br/><b>Site Traffic and Posting</b><br/><br/>Auf Brand:
<blockquote>So part of the Mush, to be fair, could just be a slow time in porkland.</blockquote>
Now, I totally don't want to make light of anyone else's comments. But I think a LOT of the reason for "slow traffic" here isn't that every person is waffling on how involved to get into the site (though there is some of that), and I lament folks thinking, "There's just nothing interesting here anymore", but I think a lot of unbridled constant-threadmaking discussion went down in three waves: 1) When the site started, 2) before GenCon, and 3) right after GenCon. The internet was abuzz, and now it's a trickle. Even on other sites I frequent: In August, the RPGNet main forum page would scrooll 3-4 pages in a single day. Nowadays it's back to about a page.<br/><br/>As others did, I TOTALLY want to encourage people to drop those thread ideas that they are sitting on. If you've got something to post that you want to discuss, post it!  Or if there's too many interesting threads going on and you don't want to be lost in a shuffle, write yourself a note and post it in a day or two (that's what I do, but I do encourage most folks to just post anyway).  I'm actually happy with the site in terms of traffic, in the fact that I'm not constantly overwhelmed. The Refresh button on these forums is the closest thing on the Internet that there is for a "patience breaker" for me. Knowing that I can log in once a day (as my work days have gotten busier since a promotion a few months back), or even every other day and <i>still</i> catch up? I'm actually genuinely more worried about what would happen if more people suddenly joined and posted constantly, than I am worried that there's only five new awesome attention-grabbing (for MY sensibility) threads every 2-3 days. But that's just my gig. I wanted to throw that down not to say "stop posting", but to consider that a lot of us have different paces when it comes to forum discussion; what may be slow (or too much) for you might be Just Right for others.<br/><br/>The most encouraging thing to me lately is that I have been sitting on a few thread ideas lately that I haven't posted yet, waiting for there to be enough time when I can participate and comment. And yet, I see a ton of other people making new topics all the time.  The board doesn't need me to be generating all the activity, and that's really exciting for me.<br/><br/>And like others have, if you have something to say but you are wary of saying it... Seriously what's the worst that could happen by starting that thread? It can't be all on my (as administrator) shoulders, though I will absolutely try to do anything I can to kill interference when I see it. But if you have something that you want to talk about, yet don't, that won't make any change at this site.<br/><br/>More in a bit...                        </div>

<blockquote>An actual, serious question: outside of the fun fluffy, outside of con planning and the threads to read and the Essential fruit, what the heck am I supposed to talk about here? <b>What gets tagged as "theory talk" seems extremely arbitrary to me and often feels like a euphemism for "a discussion I don't like" or "investigation into an area of play I'm not interested in". I've seen some people on this thread right here who state that they don't like "theory talk" enjoy themselves immensely in threads that couldn't really be considered anything else, but get huffed about Theory Talk when others that more like communications theory or deeper game analysis get brought up.</b></blockquote>
I am guilty of that, to be sure. For me, and I'm speaking as moderator here, as long as what is being discussed has practical implications (the gaming table), I'm totally cool with whatever being discussed here.  I have expressed that I didn't want to turn this into "The place to discuss GNS and Game Theory Now that Those Sections of the Forge are Closed". Not because I don't like the Forge or anything, just because I didn't want that choking off the general game chatter.<br/><br/>I remembered what some of the Theory threads were like at the Forge; some of the naval-gazing, "argue for the sake of argument" sorts of discussions that happened all the time in the Theory/GNS forum.<br/><br/>In fact, a little while ago I went into that forum (now locked) looking for an example of the Theory Threads that I don't want here, the ones that "get in the way", where it was just people heaping jargon in piles...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?board=4.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?board=4.0</a><br/><br/><b>I. Totally. Fucking. Misremembered.</b> Holy crap was I wrong about what happened there, and I'm having a nice helping of foot in mouth for rolling my eyes at 'theory talk'.<br/><br/>I went back about six full pages on that forum, and I couldn't easily spot one of those "lame theory" threads. In fact, ALL of those threads were exactly the kinds of things I wanted here at Story Games. In the GNS Discussion threads, there were more of the "Meh" kinds of theory threads, but damn the Theory section of the Forge I wish I could just lift wholesale and add it here, because it's real gaming discussion about topics that are rather interesting to gaming in general (indie, mainstream, whatever).<br/><br/>So, with that in mind, here's what I'm thinking.  First off, Theory in the "Forge Theory Forum" sense, totally fits into the Games and Gaming topic or Little Ideas. We'll probably not actually see too many of the 'airy' unpractical/unappliable/arguing-for-argument's-sake theory stuff, at least not enough to actually cause me to express concern. <b>All 'theory' discussion is kosher</b>, just keep it tied to practical gaming, and remember that not everyone is on the same page on terms or agendas.<br/><br/>Next topic in a sec.<br/><br/>BTW, if anyone sees a slow forum day and want to bring up a discussion for the heck of it, the Forge Theory Forum is a great place to lift some cool topics for discussion. Man, did I misremember.                        </div>

                            On soliciting criticism and getting game ideas.<br/><br/>It's pretty cut and dry, but I did have some thoughts and will make some changes. Here's a quote to get us started:
<blockquote>One recurring thing I'm hearing is that it's hard to get good criticism here. It seems to me that this is the exactly wrong place to solicit criticism. This isn't the place to make your game; this is the place to talk about gaming. There are better and more appropriate places for workshopping games, whether that be the Forge, Collective Endeavor, your own blog, or a playtesting network.<br/><br/>I dunno, it seems straightforward to me that this just isn't the place for soliciting criticism. Am I just limiting myself?</blockquote>
If you're designing a game, this place will be naturally be less helpful for getting good feedback. The Forge or RPGNet would be the obvious choices.<br/><br/>Having said that, there's no harm in asking, especially if you're stuck on some point. Need pointed feedback? Sure, ask here. I don't want to stop it, because I want there to be a mechanism for SG folks to ask questions/help of other SG folks. But I do want to control it, because I don't want to turn this place into a dozen development journals or an intense workshop for one major reason: The forum software can't support it without drastically changing the direction of the site.<br/><br/>If I were using phpBB or a derivative, It would totally be fine: I could have general RPG discussion entirely in one Forum Category, and a second Forum Category dedicated to design; neither will interact, so our general discussions won't be too pushed out by "What do you think of my latest game idea?" posts. This forum software pushes all categories together on one page. I can't support that.<br/><br/>Also, Ben's comments on "not wanting to turn this place into The Forge for people who don't like The Forge" apply as well. <br/><br/>If someone would step forward with a design community (Brian/Kuma started one up but had to drop it due to work, the Workshop one. Did anything happen with that? Also, Jonathan and Shreyas had some Workshop-centric ideas, anything shake loose from that), I would totally plug the hell out of you here, just as I do RPGNet or The Forge.<br/><br/>And since the Forge will eventually close, I've even thought of creating a sister-site to Story Games focusing solely on design (story-games.com/designersunite or whatever). But I don't have the time to moderate or plan it out, or personally do what needs to be done to ensure its success. If some folks are seriously interested in creating a workshop or related forum, and have the plans and dedication to follow them through, Email your ideas sometime and I might set it up with you in charge (like how Mike is the Ruler of the Wiki). Just because *I* don't have the time or interest for it doesn't mean it can't happen. But I'd seriously consider first, "Why not use The Forge"?  If your vision differs, then fine, but spell out that vision.<br/><br/>ANYWAY, back to "Hey, I need help with this idea, S-G community!"<br/><br/>Gamecraft (the discussion category) is for techniques related to play. Craft stuff. Not game design stuff. But the name is misleading, and lots of folks use it to ask for game-crafting ('design') help. That's not their fault, it's mine for not being clear enough.<br/><br/>So I'm going to add a new topic for game design related stuff, and it's going to have strict rules. <br/>"You must solicit explicit feedback" (ie "you must ask us a question that you need help with")<br/>"Don't just use it to pimp your upcoming game"<br/>"Design Journals are right out; take it to Livejournal"<br/>Stuff like that.<br/><br/>I again request that people take their ground-up nuts and bolts stuff elsewhere, but if you do have an idea or question and you really want some S-G advice, I have no problem with attempting to ask.<br/><br/>EDIT: Brand states:
<blockquote>But really, I think in a real way (Story Games is) a place to hang out and talk about fluff and have fun. Not a place to change people's minds, design a breakthrough game, or really get into it with people with radically different ideas.</blockquote>
The former: Definitely so. <br/>The latter:<br/>Change people's minds/Getting into it with people with radically different ideas: I'm hoping that with the above new thoughts on this place, no one will feel that there's no point in bringing up discussions that may do so. All I ask is that those participants approach it with respect, and don't be a dick.<br/>Design a breakthrough game: Not really. Need help with some names, or specific ideas related to that game? Hells yeah. But not ground-up building.<br/><br/>Next topic in a second.                        </div>

                            Andy, <br/><br/>So far as the "play nice when people want nice, get down when they want it" maybe we should do a little thread flagging when we start threads? Like, a simple "What I'd like out of this thread" in the first post? A "discuss" or "help me take this further" along with or alternate to "help me find the holes" or "tell me why you'd have a problem with this" just to keep people on the same page. <br/><br/>I mean really, we're all about flags in games around here, why not toss up some flags for the discussion of games too?                        </div>

                            Hey Brand: Let me post another thought or two before getting more replies (my fault for not asking earlier: I'll do 1-2 more posts and then "open it up" again: I just don't want to get distracted from the old stuff by the shiny new stuff). Also? FUCKING BRILLIANT, dude, and spot on. But more of that in a bit.<br/><br/>Back to "Being Nice" for a sec, Brand earlier dropped this:
<blockquote><br/>It isn't about being nice. Its about the fact that if you don't have a certain degree of compatibility to the main body of the "mush" then saying anything becomes difficult. Hush, hush, don't disagree with the consensus. If you don't, then you're starting trouble and not being nice and getting along with the good groove of the forum.</blockquote>
Yeah, that's not what I meant to do when I asked that people "be nice", "don't mess with the Zen", etc (and I totally accept responsibility for being vague about it earlier which led people to think that). I don't have any problem with questioning what others state.  It's that I'd rather people drop stuff like:<br/>"You're being intellectually dishonest"<br/>"You're being passive-aggressive"<br/>(and so on)<br/>I mean, what does that do to the discussion other than sour it? Sure, they have uses, but I want these to be tools of last resort, not the first things thrown down in the ring. That can't be codified into forum rules, but I wanted to share what I meant in much higher focus.<br/><br/>I've only really moderated like, MAYBE two people (one for sure, and twice at that) through private messages. Basically saying "I hear where you're coming from, and I see their behavior might be annoying, but can you please not drop this kind of stuff? It doesn't help the discussion any, not even your points". I don't have a problem with what people have to say at all, or what kinds of arguments they get into. I just wanted to do what I could to get people to think for a second about the way they get into those arguments, and how they treat the folks that they haven't met.<br/><br/>More in a sec.                        </div>

                            Hmm, the rest of my thoughts that are ripped straight from discussion here are hard to organize. So lemme just drop some words:<br/><br/>From Jonathan:
<blockquote>Story Games had the chance to be a place where people with really diverse views could come together to talk about roleplaying. For a while, it really looked like it might happen. But then it stopped heading down that road and became something else. And that's what makes me sad, because that's what I, personally, really really wanted Story Games to be. It's also what I want Push to be. It's what I want out of a roleplaying community. It's also different from what Andy wants for SG or what Levi wants for GameCraft.</blockquote>
Hmmm. I've read this a couple times, and I'm just not seeing it. I want S-G to be a general discussion site for games, with a natural (but not forced) focus on small-press or alternative method stuff. I don't see where it "became something else", unless you're referring to the part where I didn't make it clear (and again, my bad) that criticizing or arguing viewpoints is kosher as long as you do it without attacking the speaker, causing some folks to think that this wasn't the place to express a strong opinion.<br/>Also, please note that a lot of the names thrown about in this thread for "people who left" left precisely because they expressed a strong opinion that was criticized, or because another strong opinion was brought against what they were saying, and didn't want to be in a community where their views would be challenged. And this isn't a "they were too weak" thing, fuck no. It's just not what they wanted nor were interested in, and naturally left. It's like someone who doesn't like roses and lilacs leaving a perfume store. <br/><br/>I'm all over diversity of opinions here, and am doing everything in my power to make sure that they stay. Others weren't interested in diversity of opinions, and left. Or as Christian noted, got into battles they didn't like that were less about opinions and more about people. With the caveat that I do agree that I wasn't clear on the whole "Niceness doesn't mean not posting things that other might diagree with" angle.<br/><br/>Oh, one more thing (not to single Jonathan out, I'm going through the thread again post by post and his was the next to respond to):
<blockquote><br/>AR: No, not designer friendly.<br/>me: how so? no talk about design projects?<br/>AR: Well, when the main mod says, "no, I didn't want this to be a design community", I kinda tucked my tail between my legs and slunk off.</blockquote>
There's no way to crack that. Story Games is not a place where people come together to design RPGs. They come together to talk about them, mostly play, mostly GMing, and often related topics where design DOES play a part. If someone equates "this isn't the place to design games" with "we don't like designers" (not designer friendly?), then there's really little I can do there. I hope that makes sense. I'd love it if Annie wanted to talk about games and gameplay and felt like stopping by, but I can't turn this into a design guild.<br/><br/>But again, my Game Community offer still stands: Make one elsewhere, I'll link to you, else show enough interest and I'll host a sister design forum here.<br/><br/>Here's an interesting point from Judson:
<blockquote>But! I'll also say that there's been many a time I haven't posted something because it would be dis-agree-ful. And that I perennially avoid posting bad opinion about other people's games, even though I think it ought to be said.</blockquote>
Heh, this is a fun personal aside: I'll post stuff that will be dis-agree-ful without a problem. It's a personal stick up my ass that I won't publicly bash or call out games that I have problems with. I usually won't say anything about them at all, or talk up their finer points tampered with things I find problematic. But yeah, it's my own bug (and I think Ben has it too) where we just don't publicly say bad things about other games, especially when written by people we know. I don't want to encourage that everyone takes on that behavior though, it's rather boring. :-)<br/>Most designers want the honest feedback anyway.<br/><br/>On the Creamy Middle:<br/><br/>I don't think that such a middle exists. If it does, it is Jason Morningstar, as he (oh, and Joshua, lookit that) have the highest post counts and are the most moderate of speech. But without the Guys Who Don't Buy the Forge Theories (GNS/big model/etc), Folks who Want Help on their Games, Folks who Play Mostly Mainstream Stuff... this place would be boring as crap. I don't see enough momentum here yet to say that there's a "center", save for the majority of us on the point, "A lot of us like small-press or alternative-play games".<br/><br/>Back to Ben:
<blockquote>These days, I'm mostly here for the "threads to watch" threads and a few others. Otherwise, I feel blocked out by a wall of people going "we don't want you here because you might challenge someone's implicitly held beliefs... If Andy posts and says "yeah, I thought about that, and fuck you guys" then I'll be on my way."</blockquote>
Heh. How about, "Yeah, I thought about that, and you guys are right".  Hope my above explanations make it clear as to why.<br/><br/>One last bit....                        </div>

                            Finally! (before getting to the New Stuff here): I know I'm forgetting one or two points from the above mass of posts. I read it all, and again if I had the time I'd be Whispering each and every one of you for your thoughts and time, they all were read and all have an impact.<br/><br/>I especially call upon Fred's powers above, in asking that folks make this place a better place by talking about what they want to talk about.<br/><br/>Next I call upon the powers of the Mighty Refresh Button, in the hopes that people don't think that a forum isn't worthwhile if it doesn't have 3 new awesome threads every time you check the site. part of the laid back I'm aiming for is the fact that the forum may run slower than RPGNet, and that is a Good Thing.<br/><br/>Here's some other stuff in relation to the forums, to finish out the Fireside Chat:<br/><br/>A recap of changes:<br/>* Me being explicit about the me"Challenge each others viewpoints. Don't mess with the Zen. <b>The Zen is only messed with when you challenge people in a hostile way.</b>", where Hostile means name-calling and antagonization.

Unfortunately, with such a large community (we're one of the largest communities ever to use this software) it becomes a little hard to scale. I've been waffling for months on the idea of possibly moving to a more traditional forum software (with few topics, maybe only 3 or so). I'll entertain thoughts on that later as well.<br/><br/>Finally, one major issue as the year winds down.<br/><br/>This community was always a "test community".  As to not get too involved with it, I always set up the condition that "if it becomes too unwieldy or just otherwise not worth the time, that I'll pull the plug and that will be that".  After about a year of this community in "test/beta mode", I'm upgrading the status to "Semi-permanent". I don't want to treat these forums as this thing that's beyond us, that Must Continue At All Costs", but I've had a fucking blast this last year and see no reason to terminate that. We'll see the forums continue for another year and see how it goes.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Can I chime in as a newbie?<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with what shutupgirl has posted. I loathe jargon. Jargon, used with the express intent of getting everyone on the same page, turns the language into Calvinball. I go back and read all of these articles that explain what these terms mean, and halfway through, I forget what it was I originally wanted to know. I understand getting everyone on the same page, but I'd love it if we could do it in a common language. That's why I'm loath to post on the Forge: If you don't buy in to the jargon, you won't get much you can use. I don't understand games through jargon; I need examples. Point me to something and say, "That's X," great, I can take it from there.<br/>
<br/>
That's why I like it here. The jargon isn't nearly as thick, and most people talk about games in a more casual, relaxed atmosphere, while still getting around to discussing ideas, and craft, and things that they want clarified, or would want to see.<br/>
<br/>
I'll admit: I'm in the kiddie pool on games. This site is my speed, because I come here and feel like I'm learning stuff without having to do the mental equivalent of rock-climbing for the first time. The Forge overwhelms me, RPGnet underwhelms me, and this place is just right. Finally, a site where we can have fun talking about the games and get some serious feedback in!<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to have designers come on here and talk more about how they do what they do, and ask for feedback. I'd like to be a designer myself, but I can't handle the jargon. It's been awhile since I was in school. I'd love to get a low-key, conversational instruction about how to get mechanics to fit my games, because I suck at mechanics. Having a few good designers on board to pick their brains on what they did for their games and why would be great. So that sucks, but hopefully a few come back and stick around and talk more about what they did and why.<br/>
<br/>
So, basically, this is me saying that Story Games is a good website for people just starting out: they get surrounded by people concentrating on the games, and the conversations mostly occcur in plain English/(insert language of choice here) uncontaminated with jargon. I wouldn't mind if something was done to get more game creators in here, as long as those of us who want to hang out and enjoy games can come along for the ride.                        </div>

                            Johnzo nailed it with his water state analogies.  I am more comfortable here than at the other two sites.  RPG.net is somewhere I go mostly for Actual Play discussion or game reviews or occasional rubbernecking.  I hit the Forge because I dig the analytical rigor Ron and others offer in regard to Actual Play, and because Iâ€™m into a lot of the games that keep forums there.<br><br>And yes, after following Forge theory for years, Iâ€™m comfortable with the various bits of the model Iâ€™ve appropriated for my own use.  I could care less about redesigning the wheel, which is what it looks like to me when other folks unveil their own grand theory stuff.  Wrangling over semantics and definitions of baseline terms just ainâ€™t fresh anymore.  I stay the hell away from ideological clashes over theory.  In my judgment, the Forge pretty much beat it to death and buried it at a crossroads with garlic in its mouth.  Iâ€™m sympathetic to those folks who donâ€™t have a taste for jargon, because there are parts of the Forge discussion that are way too fractal even for me, but I appreciate the vocabulary and insights Iâ€™ve acquired.<br><br>So if you have a thread about theory, Iâ€™m unlikely to give it a look, brilliant as it may be.  Iâ€™m not your audience.  Not anymore.<br><br>Second, Iâ€™m a player, but not a designer.  Though Iâ€™m interested in design in terms of the choices a given system offers me as a player, Iâ€™m more interested at this stage in actual play and improving the quality of that play.  So if you have a design thread, Iâ€™m likely giving it a pass.  If youâ€™re building another niche game about miniature weasels trapped in a bell jar in 17th century London, cool for you, rock on toward your dream.  I hope you get feedback, but Iâ€™m not on the ride with you.<br><br/>All this is a long-winded way of saying in the marketplace of ideas here, Iâ€™m not a buyer for a considerable swatch of them.  Iâ€™m not hostile to them, just not interested.  On the other hand, I enjoy some of the social threads because I like knowing more about the people Iâ€™m interacting with.  I love the â€œAwesome-o-fyâ€ threads and discussions on gamecraft, social contract, and actual play.  Thatâ€™s what works for me and draws me in.  Contrariwise, Iâ€™m not compelled by queries about favorite game shows or â€œme tooâ€ threads.  If Iâ€™m not contributing to your thread, Iâ€™m not grabbed by it, and I do not labor under a sense of obligation that I must nevertheless provide feedback.<br/><br/>The comment someone made about not feeling welcome because of a vibe of â€œwe don't want you here because you might challenge someone's implicitly held beliefsâ€ strikes me as, well, more than a tad pretentious.  I mean, come on.  Andyâ€™s â€œZenâ€ philosophy seems like a no-brainer: criticize an idea or a statement or a piece of work but donâ€™t go ad hominem.  Iâ€™ve never seen the admonishment to â€œplay niceâ€ as a damper on conversation.<br/><br/>Truth be told, Iâ€™m more comfortable posting here than the Forge, because the atmosphere is looser, and thereâ€™s more leeway for offbeat, experimental notions about developing setting or oddball discussions on character sheet design or use of flower petals and honey to set the mood during play.  For me, the â€œlounge for Forge-itesâ€ is a resounding success.  If some folks left because they felt underappreciated or too radical for the â€œmilquetoast clique,â€ or not sufficiently challenged by the content here, thatâ€™s a bummer, but itâ€™s their choice.  My experience is that communities evolve over time.  They change as membership expands.  Members drift in and out; priorities may drift with them.  Câ€™est la vie.<br/><br/>So ramble aside, this has been a cool thread.  From what Iâ€™ve read, some folks want a welcoming atmosphere for theory and for-publication design discussion.  Others want a welcoming atmosphere generally with a minimum of trolling and blather, but without a hard hand on the moderator wheel.  Others want a welcoming atmosphere for discussions of craft and actual play.  My read is that Andy is offering this spot as a place where indie games are celebrated, but not one with tightly patrolled borders to keep posters focused on â€œsubstance.â€  Are these groups all that far off from one another?<br/><br/>And for the record, I LOVE having my implicitly held beliefs challenged.  :-)<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Blake                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Andy,<br/><br/>As regards forum software: I love Vanilla. The problems scaling you cite are real, and probably can't be ignored, but seriously, the software is what keeps me more active here than at other forums. I keep trying to get into Gamecraft, but I have trouble wanting to look at the software (sorry, Levi). Vanilla (and Jazzman!) make this site easy on the eyes and ultranavigable to me. Thats all. Otherwise I think you're right on track. And, sadly, I have no better solution to propose to the scaling problem. <br/><br/>Dave                        </div>

If I could miraculously become a super ultra genius at coding, I'd do something like this to open this site more to bottom-up game development:<br/><br/>See the tabs at the top? I'd move them all one over to the Right, and create a new tab (which would be the default) for the site, called "Home". In that, I'd set it up so that you'd see two "aggregates" of topics. The first bundle would be all the normal topics we see here. The second bundle would be 2-3 new design topics, plus an overlap of stuff like Forum Discussion, Links to Gaming Discussion, etc.  <br/><br/>That's the way I would do it; it would still be easy on the eyes, and you could still click the "Discussions" tab to see ALL the topics at once if you wanted.<br/><br/>If I were a programmer, <br/>Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.<br/>All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.<br/>If I were a programmer.                        </div>

That's exactly my thought as well. Actually, the above isn't technical, it's social. It's just whether we implement a Social Process or not. I'm in favor of "not for all threads", and "but go ahead and do so if you think it will help you out".<br/><br/>As you say, if you have no particular thing you want out of the thread, then totally don't set a flag. If there's something you're looking for, set a flag. I'm not for everyone setting flags for all threads like some sort of template or anything like that.<br/><br/>I've noticed just now that in most of my threads where I'm looking for feedback, I tended to (without thinking about it) set flags: The original Awesome-O-Fy threads and the like, because I was looking for a specific style of response/thread. But for normal stuff, I just yak it up, no flags.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Same here. It's ... I don't know, quirky in a very likeable sense. It feels a bit like the community itself: Easy-going and interesting, with a hint of "strange and unusual". I don't know, if I had to name the feeling it would probably "geeky in a very nice and positive way", <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">like a cute girl browsing a comic store...</span><br/>...<br/>Ok, I'll stop now before i talk too much bullshit. Let's say I like Vanilla and would miss it.                        </div>
