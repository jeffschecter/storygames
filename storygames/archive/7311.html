Aren't I special?<br/><br/>Actually, though, this is less about SW and more about making a quasi-traditional-ish character advancement system for SotC, at least through the first four sessions of play.  I had this idea awhile ago, so let's see if I remember it all.<br/><br/>You start out with five Skills at +1, one Stunt, and two Aspects.  (The exact number of starting Fate Points is negotiable; I'd suggest three or four instead of two, just to make sure people have a few to play with; maybe even more given how limited starting characters will be compared to normal SotC heroes.)  At the end of the session, you advance four out of the five Skills to +2, take four new Skills at +1, take another Stunt, and two more Aspects, the latter based on what happened during the session.  (I actually think it would be wise to define one Aspect mid-way through the session and the other at the end, so that you wind up with sort of an <i>in media res</i> Aspect and a reflecting-back-on-what-happened Aspect.)  <br/><br/>At the end of session two, repeat the process, only you advance nine Skills:  three from +2 to +3, three from +1 to +2, and three from +0 to +1 (to avoid gaps in the pyramid).<br/><br/>At the end of session three, you advance eight more Skills:  two from +3 to +4, two from +2 to +3, two from +1 to +2, and two from +0 to +1.<br/><br/>At the end of session four, you advance five Skills:  one from +4 to +5, one from +3 to +4, one from +2 to +3, one from +1 to +2, and one from +0 to +1.<br/><br/>I like the idea that new Skills you add during play should be ones you either see other people using, or attempt to use untrained at least once, though this probably isn't strictly necessary.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that whatever you wind up with at the top of your pyramid will be one of the five Skills you started with, so your "dessssssstiny" is kind of apparent from the beginning (also, your starting Stunt should obviously be based on one of those five starting Skills).<br/><br/>I feel this system would allow for a nice "farmboy becomes badass hero" character arc across the five session campaign, while not preventing further play with the more standard "no advancement" SotC rules.<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162515/#Comment_162515" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T18:29:10+00:00" title="August 13, 2008  6:29PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So my farmboy has to start out with the skills and stunts that make him a badass Jedi hero?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162516/#Comment_162516" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T18:30:47+00:00" title="August 13, 2008  6:30PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Matt!<br/><br/>I think that would work but that it would be very fast, very far advancement for FATE, even for the genre you want to emulate.  There is a much bigger difference in FUDGE/FATE between someone who is Good (3) at something and someone who is Great (4) at something than a differential of 1 in most systems would indicate.  I think you'll find yourself tempted to begin with really low opposition in the first couple sessions and inflate it for the last two sessions, rather than keep it somewhat level such that you'll risk lose that feeling of increasing in potency; the space station that was full of computer defenses that were Fair difficulty to hack into will suddenly have Great defenses to maintain challenge and interest.<br/><br/>I also think that 2 Aspects is a little spare to define a character.  <br/><br/>SotC has a secret formula.  A SotC pulp hero has 40 "Skill" Points which have been used to buy 35 points worth of Skills in a 5 tier pyramid and 5 Stunts at a cost of 1 each.  They have 10 Aspects because 40/4 is 10 and a SotC character gets an Aspect for every 4 Skill Points in its makeup.<br/><br/>Here's how I would do it.<br/><br/>Session 1:<br/>20 points = 5 Aspects, 5 Skills at Average, 4 at Fair, 2 at Good(19), and 1 Stunt.<br/><br/>After each session, give them 5 Skill Points of advancement, one of which must be used to buy a Stunt.  Their only prohibition is that they must maintain the pryamid shape/rules.  If they can't, they can spend the points next time (haven't worked this out exactly).<br/><br/>25 points = 6 Aspects, 2 Stunts, Skills as desired within pyramid shape.<br/>30 points = 7 Aspects, 3 Stunts, Skills as desired within pyramid shape.<br/>35 points = 8 Aspects, 4 Stunts, Skills as desired within pyramid shape.<br/>40 points = 10 Aspects, 5 Stunts, and a full SotC-style pyramid.<br/><br/>Others might be able to provide links that explain this formula better, and it is just one way of determining advancement in FATE.  My main point is that your current mode is really steep.  As proposed, your Jedi Master at the end of 4 sessions isn't 5 times better than your farm boy - he's like 20 times better, perhaps.<br/><br/>There are some Star Wars suggestions on the FATE yahoo group you might find helpful.<br/><br/>Cheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162531/#Comment_162531" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T21:46:18+00:00" title="August 13, 2008  9:46PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2008 9:51PM by noclue.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm...Steerpike's Spirit of the Force games have pretty much broken me.

I'm not sure I can contemplate running Star Wars with anything but SOTC*, basically.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Jedi Master at the end of 4 sessions isn't 5 times better than your farm boy - he's like 20 times better, perhaps.</blockquote>After watching the Clone Wars animated series, this does not sound like much of a problem to me. Jedi masters should be 20 times better than farm boys.<br/><br/>My biggest problem is that monkeying with advancement doesn't scream STAR WARS to me. If you want to play Luke on Tatooin why not just stat him up as a normal FATE character who has a +6 drive skill, +5 farming, etc. Then when you want to play Young Master Luke, stat him with +6 light saber but put drive down to +5, give him some aspects that speak to his rashness, his distrust of the force, etc. When he is a veteran, restat him with a +5 light saber skill and put force sensitivity in +6, but give him a stunt that allows him to use his force sensitivity to attack. In other words, isn't it easier (and by easier, inside I'm saying better) to just restat the character between Episode IV: The New Hope and Episode V:Empire Strikes Back to tie him into what the story is going to be about?<br/><br/>*EDIT: I <i>can </i>see playing it with PtA as well after hearing about the game of Star Wars: EPISODE L that a bunch of podcasters played at GenCon 2007.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162535/#Comment_162535" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T21:56:25+00:00" title="August 13, 2008  9:56PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno.

They would have to be more powerful than regular Fate, in order to make the corruption something enticing. Also certain Sith stunts would unlock more powerful Sith stunts, but only if you had so many Dark Fate... and perhaps that harms your ability to generate and use regular Fate?<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162574/#Comment_162574" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T08:54:11+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  8:54AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well... don't compel for Dark Side.

So, if you DO allow dark side characters maybe have the refresh represented as a line of boxes that you darken, but keep the refresh total (the "you become an npc because you have no free will" is not in effect, in this case, anyway). So, you get the powerful invokes, AND you keep your refresh. <br/>When you have more dark boxes than light (the same case as above) you start unlocking Dark Side stunts, maybe: harsh mind control, mind numbing, lightnings from the hands, that kind of stuff... and once you start getting dark stunts, it becomes nearly impossible returning to the light. It should in my mind be the central point of your character story from then on, a central quest.<br/><br/><br/>If you also want support for all kinds of crazy tech and starship combat, take a look at Starblazer Adventures from Cubicle7: porting it to star wars should be a no brainer, really, once you have the Force stuff figured out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162634/#Comment_162634" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T12:50:29+00:00" title="August 14, 2008 12:50PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are all great ideas.
