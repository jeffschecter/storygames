I asked the GM, "Is that doable?" and the GM replied, "Roll!"  <br/><br/>So I rolled a success, and the GM said, "You successfully shove the cowardly guy forward!  However, he stumbles and knocks into the injured woman, causing her to fall and provoking an Attack of Opportunity by the gremlins."<br/><br/>"Uh," I replied, "if <i>that</i> was a success, what was I rolling for?  I asked you if it was doable."<br/><br/>"You rolled to push him!" the GM answered.  "And you did.  And this is what happens when you push people who weren't expecting it!"<br/><br/>Obviously there's a problem here -- "Is that doable?" isn't about whether I can push a guy, it's about whether I can push a guy <i>into the specific position I stated</i>, and the GM ought to answer me with "yes", "no", or "you can't tell" before the action's in motion.  I know many ways to fix this, and I've been pondering which one will go over most easily, socially, with a GM I just met and who is used to being in charge during game time.  As I've pondered, I've assumed that he'll be on board with fixing this obvious glitch.  But just now, I realized:<br/><br/>To him, it might not be a glitch.  He might <i>like</i> having players act in ignorance, so that he can come down on them with his own judgment of the consequences, as a surprise, and without anyone else weighing in.<br/><br/>This just occurred to me, because when I was first GMing, <i>I used to do this</i>.  I initially did it just because my first GM had done it, and this sort of authority seemed to fit naturally with buying books and prepping dungeons and hosting and facilitating and all the other stuff the GM apparently did.  But I <i>kept</i> doing it because it was <i>fun</i>.  Not good, healthy, sustainable fun for the whole group -- I see that now, and that's why I don't do it anymore -- but fun nonetheless.  The players want to do something, and in my head I form a vision of what'll happen that clashes with theirs, and right then, as they're bent on the outcome of their effort and looking to me in suspense, I get to surprise them and express my own vision and provoke a strong reaction.  What a rush!  Often it led to arguments or disappointed players, but in the end, they willingly bowed to my authority often enough to keep me coming back to that well.<br/><br/>If someone had asked me, "Hey, could you <i>not</i> do that?  Could you give the players the info they want so they can make informed decisions?", I probably would have been so surprised that I would have responded, "You must not know what 'GM' means."<br/><br/>I'm the new guy in a group of friends who've played together before.  I don't want to rock the boat any more than I have to.  I don't want to tell the GM that I'll only have fun if I can take his toy away.  Is there a way we can both be happy?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443952/#Comment_443952" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T10:50:33+00:00" title="March 12, 2015 10:50AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno man.

And in real life you don't know for certain what will happen when you push someone until you do push them. He's being fair as he sees it, and describes the most likely consequences of an unexpected push as he sees them.<br/><br/>Or the GM is following common passive-aggressive advice on how to deal with disruptive players without actually confronting them (by providing consistent, unpleasant consequences in-game to unwanted in-game behaviours).<br/><br/>(Or he's doing what you described, which is something that never occurred to me but does explain a lot about the behaviour of a fledgling GM I played with a long time ago.)<br/><br/>Also in my experience there's no way for a new guy in any group to provide negative feedback without stepping on someone's toes or ask for explanation why something happened without giving the vibe of questioning the authority.<br/><br/>I suppose you could ask about how, in future, if you wanted to do XYZ, should you go about making sure that XYZ happens as described, without unintended consequences. This is basically asking about the preferred communication format of the GM, and the way they view the role of the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443954/#Comment_443954" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T12:12:32+00:00" title="March 12, 2015 12:12PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2015 12:26PM by Big_J_Money.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally get your point about wanting to know consequences before rolling.  I'm exploring the idea of playing more (I think) in something like Eero's style, so I'm curious, David, what you would think about this kind of response:<br/><br/>David: "Is that doable?"<br/>Me: "Describe how you do that."<br/><br/>Assuming you describe how your character does it, and the description contains intent (the part about the position you want him in), the way I would want to "resolve" that would be that you simply get what you want, or if I think it should be a challenge, I would start describing the obstacles in your way that you would have to roll against <i>should you choose to go through with what you described and roll the dice</i>.  But you could step back from your description if you don't like the sound of the obstacles in your way.<br/><br/>This is clearly not the same method as having a dialogue with me about stakes.  That's why I'm curious what your take on it is.<br/><br/>Edit: So about the part about ambushing you with unexpected consequences.  For the most part, I think the consequences of your actions should be clear.  You try to jump over a pit and <i>fail</i> and you fall into the pit.  But there are at least two things here:<br/><br/>1) Sometimes there are surprises.  You climb a cliff and it starts to rain halfway through.  Now you have a harder difficulty.  In your example the surprise was the GM sort of punishing you for "not paying attention to the rules"  That's my interpretation; that he thinks you weren't thinking out the consequences of moving a character near an enemy, the consequences of which in modern D&amp;D is an AOO.  I think with a game like modern D&amp;D with all its rules, it's way better to do the "let's talk about stakes before rolling" thing.  But this GM may very well think this is part of the fun: letting players "fall on the sword of the rules" until they know them well enough to not fall prey to the same consequences?  Not my cup of tea since I abandoned pouring through tomes of rules-texts and character abilities years ago.<br/><br/>2) This surprise happened even though you were successful on your roll.  I can't imaging running a game like that, but I also dislike modern editions of D&amp;D (just a matter of style-preference).  Again, I don't think the GM cares/thinks about player intent.  I think there is just a different agenda to get to the fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443955/#Comment_443955" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T12:30:55+00:00" title="March 12, 2015 12:30PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, to be clear: I think the GM's point of view is perfectly valid in his agenda.  The rules are pretty clear about the message of what AOO is for.  I don't know your GM here, but my experience has been that this is a common agenda for people who exclusively play one RPG: knowing the rules by heart and expecting the other players at the table to see the world's operation in light of those rules also.  Or to learn to.

I'd ask on the spot whether it was OK to talk about it right here, now, as it's fresh. Either way, on the spot or after the session, I'd try to find out what the basis of the ruling was. After all, communication is key and the GM might have admirable justifications for their call.<br/><br/>(As a GM I <i>always</i> have these discussions on the spot because I very much consider them part of the game. A GM's legitimacy rests on nothing but the justifications of their rulings, so how could you not encourage and embrace players who dare to call you on your bullshit...)<br/><br/>Anyway, assuming the GM is amenable, perhaps you could ask them to fine-tune their play for the future. The particulars of how would presumably depend on your shared goals; it could be that he needs to predeclare consequences more thoroughly before rolls, or he needs to double-check that the players know what they're asking for, or he needs to outline risks explicitly before things are attempted, or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443959/#Comment_443959" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T13:02:43+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  1:02PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tough call.<br/><br/>I'd say that one experience isn't enough to make an informed decision from. You really need a bit more exposure to them to determine if the person is normally pretty solid, or makes 'bad calls' regularly, or if there's simply a different table environment than you're used to.<br/><br/>I'd also say that as calls go, this one isn't all that bad really. I can see several 'outs' whereby the GM was acting well within scope and intent (BigJ mentions some). Without their input we'll never know the warrants for the decision, and therefore can't say with certainty. I don't personally find their choice there optimal by the way, just don't think it's awful either.<br/><br/>Finally I'd mention that in many games, especially D&amp;D (or directly derivative thereof), the DM is essentially God. Their power and influence is nearly limitless by design. Now, that can lead to abuse of power, or a mismatch between players and GM, but it can also lead to some pretty spectacular gaming...so long as the values and preferences of everyone present match. When they don't, and someone doesn't have fun because of it, it's not a 'right way to play' issue, it's a 'playing with the right group, or right game' issue. I don't think you'd be out of line to gather more info about the playstyle at the table to decide if it's something you're interested in, and doing so might communicate that you're questioning the fit enough that for the DM to make allowances, at least until you're 'up to speed'.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443961/#Comment_443961" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T14:08:01+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  2:08PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2015 2:09PM by Airk.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I dunno man.  In the same situation I would have interpreted him saying "roll" as meaning "roll to see if it's doable", which I would have done, and then the fiction would have crashed as soon as he said anything besides yes or no.  But in his mind, saying "roll" may have meant "of course it's doable, provided you make the actual roll."</blockquote>\nExcept that he didn't use EITHER of those explanations.  He instead basically meant, "If you roll, something will happen, and it won't necessarily be your intent, even if you succeed on the roll."<br/><br/>I think your second interpretation is a perfectly legitimate thing for a reasonable GM to have meant.  Unfortunately, the thing he actually meant is not.<br/><br/>Also, Big_J_Money - I don't really understand where you are coming from here.  What you describe as "Tell me what you do and I'll tell you what the obstacles/potential consequences are" is exactly a "discussion of stakes".   Just because it's framed fictionally doesn't make it not a discussion of stakes.  In fact, almost all discussions of stakes are framed fictionally, because the vast majority of the stakes ARE fictional.  The only time it they're not is if the discussion is along the lines of "Just how much damage would I take from the fall?" because there's a direct mechanical 'real world' (even if it's just numbers on paper) consequence.<br/><br/>Also, I disagree that the GM is within the rules here.  First, I can't find anything anywhere for any D&amp;D version that indicates that falling prone triggers an attack of opportunity (it clearly does NOT in 4E, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't in 3/3.5, though standing up from prone does).  Second, the whole issue here isn't "he bumped into her and knocked her over, causing an AoO" but rather "My intent was to push him in FRONT of her, not INTO her, so why did he bump into her if I succeeded on my roll?"  Or maybe you just misunderstand the circumstances? He's NOT complaining that the opponent got an attack against the person he PUSHED (in fact, as far as I can tell from the example, the enemy didn't get an AoO against the person they probably should have), he's complaining that the opponent got an AoE against the person he was trying to PROTECT (who, by all rights, should not have been involved in this action at all, except perhaps as part of a fail state).  So no, I don't think there's a rules leg to stand on here.<br/><br/>Similarly, phoenix182, I don't really think a "DM is all powerful! Kneel before Zod!" actually applies here either.  This is right up there with "I shoot the goblin! I rolled a 20!" "Okay, you shoot your buddy who was standing along the line of fire! Hey, sorry, but melee is chaotic!" It's essentially denying the player agency.<br/><br/>All that said, I don't really think there's a "comfortable" way to have this conversation.  As framed, the GM clearly has different expectations.  I would be strongly tempted to explain my stance and then bow out of the game, but I don't think that would make the point clear either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443962/#Comment_443962" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T14:16:35+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  2:16PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Run.

This happens occasionally in both my groups - a statement is expanded on, embellished, maybe willfully misinterpreted, and it results in some complication or challenge. Or a question is answered with descriptive action. Because we carry our character agency lightly and are always looking out for interesting outcomes, and because we trust each other not to be dicks about it, it is a net gain.

Hey, sorry, but melee is chaotic!" It's essentially denying the player agency.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nAgreed, it's not RAW. It should have been on the one he pushed (or himself), and only if the push resulted in movement in/out of a threatened square or other provoking action (and I don't think even a trip provokes). Going prone doesn't provoke, as you said.<br/><br/>In early versions of D&amp;D (pre-3rd) players have very little agency, and the DM truly is God. He can ignore any rule, change any rule, and dictate reality through narrative fiat. While what you describe is ridiculous, it would be well within RAW in those early editions. Such a DM would likely lose all his players, but he would technically be acting within the rules. Since this was Pathfinder (which was based on 3.5) I would expect a natural inclination more towards technical rules, and less towards DMcentric fiat. However, if they come from an earlier edition background I can easily see how they'd slip back more towards that style, hence my mentioning it.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443978/#Comment_443978" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T16:26:29+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  4:26PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>However, if they come from an earlier edition background I can easily see how they'd slip back more towards that style, hence my mentioning it.</blockquote>\nThat's true;  It might just be a 'force of habit' thing, in which case it might work to just politely point out "That's not actually what the rules say should happen."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443985/#Comment_443985" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T18:37:28+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  6:37PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2015 6:40PM by 2097.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Seems like you handled it fine, David.<br/>It seems to me that you don't need to roll to push someone like that.<br/>What would have happened if you missed?

But I'm confident that it is.  <br/><br/>This was my third session with this group, and the GM has often responded to character actions that he judged to be ill-advised with, "Ha ha, that was dumb, now you're in trouble."  I'm fine with winding up in trouble if I have any sense of the risks involved, and I'm also fine with being told "your character can't tell, so you're signing up for the GM's judgment!"  The only thing I dislike is when my job is to determine "what can I do that will be useful here", and I don't have access to the relevant factors in judging that.  <br/><br/>If the group were playing as Jason describes -- interesting outcomes over character agency -- then I'd welcome the ignorance and simply strive mainly to be colorful and interesting.  But this is a Pathfinder dungeon crawl, and no one seems eager to lose hit points because I decided to (e.g.) roleplay an interesting character reaction instead of choosing the optimal attack.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is probably that I just find a long series of to-hit rolls with zero fictional positioning to be boring as hell, so I'm trying to mix it up.  Unlike the min-maxed orc in the party, who gets to revel in doing 30+ damage per hit, my guy's a wizard, and when I chose that class I wasn't thinking that "wait until your initiative rolls around and roll to hit with your crossbow" would be the bulk of my contribution.  I figured I could use my cute little first-level spells to distract opponents and make them waste actions at the very least -- but that depends on being able to agree with the GM on what's possible in the fiction.<br/><br/>It's possible that my default job is to be irrelevant in combats and contribute elsewhere, which is something I could live with if we weren't playing a giant dungeon module.<br/><br/>The other players seem mostly content to revel in their characters' mechanical combat abilities during fights, and provide comic relief whenever we're not fighting.  I'm right there with them for the comedy; just looking for ways to engage with the dungeon crawl too.<br/><br/>I absolutely can <i>force</i> the info I want out of the GM, simply by refusing to roll until I can get answers about whether a successful roll will accomplish my aim or whatnot, but I suspect that'd produce some unwelcome friction and, as I said, take the GM's "gotcha!" toy away.<br/><br/>What I'm hoping to find is a way to let the GM play his "gotcha"s and also let me interact meaningfully with the dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443998/#Comment_443998" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T20:06:52+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  8:06PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2015 8:09PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I realize my earlier response may have been a bit hyperbolic, but, in my defense, such a response from a GM does not, in my experience, indicate fatigue or the 1987 Pink Floyd album\u2014it indicates genuine godmoding. And it's not just bad in the moment, it is, to borrow from Eero, <i>unhygienic</i>. That is, if you can do it now, where a success doesn't actually get you anything, why not do it later? Or all the time? Or vice versa, where you rolled a failure but nothing bad happens to you?</blockquote>\nI think the issue is he was trying to do something very specific in combat. There is a legitimate approach to the game where the players are free to say what they want to try and the GM has to use some judgment to decide what possible outcomes that can lead to. Some choices the players make are going to have nothing but bad to somewhat bad results. Rolling a die doesnt change that necessarily. I't isn't just a game of rules and dice rolls but a game of choices and decisions. I am not sure the GM made the best call in this particular case, but I wouldn't say it is unhygienic for a GM to decide what the potential results of a successful roll are and not the player (I know as a player I like having the GM apply judgment here). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443999/#Comment_443999" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T20:08:38+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  8:08PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brendan, I hope my last reply clarifies that "GM decides" is not my issue here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444000/#Comment_444000" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T20:14:55+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  8:14PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>What I'm hoping to find is a way to let the GM play his "gotcha"s and also let me interact meaningfully with the dungeon.</blockquote>\nI think the only way to do that is talk privately with him and see what his expectations are and what he is willing to do. I would be diplomatic (I wouldn't call it a "Gotcha toy" in the conversation) but be clear about what the problem for you is. If he is a reasonable person, you should be able to express your concern and he should be willing to find some kind of compromise (unless there is some sort of deep play style issue that makes that impossible for either of you). But if this is something he isn't willing to change, resents changing, or the group has zero concern for, I think your only two remaining options are to tolerate it and remain in the game or find a new group. <br/><br/>Aside from this one part of play, how much are enjoying the rest of it?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444001/#Comment_444001" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T20:22:04+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  8:22PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Dave, your question was "can we both be happy?" <br/><br/>I am going to guess that the answer is "no" in this situation.

I don't know the guy well enough to know how sensitive he is, so my plan is definitely to be polite.  I also agree that "privately" is the way to go -- much as I hate the idea of a GM feeling the need to stand up for their authority in front of the group, I'm not gonna pretend it's not a thing.<br/><br/>Of the three other players in the group, one seems to also want to be able to make some fiction-based strategic decisions (the most excitement he showed all session was during my planning to light the gremlin cave on fire), another seems to want to do that only very occasionally and otherwise make jokes and inflict huge amounts of damage, and the third guy seems to enjoy doing the obvious in fights and otherwise heckling every PC and NPC in the game with innuendo or braggadocio.<br/><br/>I am loving the comedic aspect of the game -- for example, our orc was raised by an intelligent axe and thinks our goblin is a baby orc.  I am also enjoying the minor developments in our relationships with the townsfolk around the dungeon, and it's cool to see each new monster in the dungeon and go, "Whoa!  What is <i>that</i>?"  I'm also fine with HP loss as a pacing mechanism for when we leave the dungeon to get healed; the unpredictability of "How far will we get this time?" is kinda fun.  I was also psyched for the premise of the adventure, which is about a crashed meteor, an extinguished magical flame, and a missing friend, but we've yet to actually encounter anything that sheds light on any of those.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444003/#Comment_444003" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T20:36:47+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  8:36PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2015 8:51PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, perhaps.

He only has to tell you what your character can sense about the situation. I do think if it is easily foreseeable that you shoving one character foreword might hit another character, then the GM does need to say something like "You certainly can shove her but you also think so and so might be in her pathway" (though in some circumstances that may be something you can't see from your vantage point). So I don't think the GM needs to say "if you succeed, this will be the outcome" he just needs to have given you enough information about the situation that you can make an informed choice. It sounds like he wasn't doing that though in this case.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444029/#Comment_444029" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-13T13:00:15+00:00" title="March 13, 2015  1:00PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that he's messing up IIEE basics which I wouldn't necessarily attribute to malice or god-mode, just a lack of exposure to other ideas.<br/>Maybe his way is good, don't shove people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444030/#Comment_444030" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-13T13:12:43+00:00" title="March 13, 2015  1:12PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a little confused here.

I'm fine with winding up in trouble if I have any sense of the risks involved, and I'm also fine with being told "your character can't tell, so you're signing up for the GM's judgment!"  The only thing I dislike is when my job is to determine "what can I do that will be useful here", and I don't have access to the relevant factors in judging that.</blockquote>\nFrom that comment, it sounds to me that the relevant factors are supposed to be the Pathfinder rules, and that the GM's prodding is meant to encourage learning them. The GM might consider the players' job to be to know the rules and use them to their advantage, or to learn them through trial and error.<br/><br/>That said, the example in your initial post was decidedly off from the Pathfinder rules; in Pathfinder, shoving people around is explicitly covered by the rules in some detail, and it works out quite differently (and arguably, more reasonably): 1) you attempt to shove the coward; 2) he gets an attack of opportunity against you, making your shove more difficult if he hits you; 3) if you make your check, you shove him, conceivably protecting the injured character by making him a more convenient target for the enemy; 4) he doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity for being shoved; 5) even if you do shove him into the injured woman, which is something that should be under your control, she doesn't fall down, he just bumps into her and stops moving.\n<blockquote>Part of the problem is probably that I just find a long series of to-hit rolls with zero fictional positioning to be boring as hell, so I'm trying to mix it up.  Unlike the min-maxed orc in the party, who gets to revel in doing 30+ damage per hit, my guy's a wizard, and when I chose that class I wasn't thinking that "wait until your initiative rolls around and roll to hit with your crossbow" would be the bulk of my contribution.  I figured I could use my cute little first-level spells to distract opponents and make them waste actions at the very least -- but that depends on being able to agree with the GM on what's possible in the fiction.<br/><br/>It's possible that my default job is to be irrelevant in combats and contribute elsewhere, which is something I could live with if we weren't playing a giant dungeon module.</blockquote>\nSpeaking from my experience of what is typical for Pathfinder, you're mostly right about the expected contribution of a low-level wizard in a dungeon crawl, but you're not necessarily right about the need for some sort of negotiation with the GM. The spells' effects are quite explicitly described, and you can mostly expect them to work as written.<br/><br/>It might seem reasonable to be able to distract an enemy by making their sword light up with a light spell, but that's not what the Pathfinder light spell says it does: it just lights something up, no distraction. On the other hand, color spray is intended and described as a visual distraction spell, so if that's what you want to do, that's what you should use.

It might not be to the liking of the shoved character considering you've described him as a coward, but I can easily see a character wanting to be shoved like that: you're basically using your shove action to give him a free move, and actions are one of the most precious resources in Pathfinder combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444088/#Comment_444088" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-15T18:08:39+00:00" title="March 15, 2015  6:08PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2015 6:10PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points, <a href="/forums/profile/shimrod">@shimrod</a>, thanks!

The rules are quite precise, and if you're playing by the rules (and know them), a look at the grid tells you unambiguously whether there's room to push someone, whether or not you will provoke an attack from an enemy with a dagger, an enemy with a sword, an enemy rider with a lance... which might seem like details requiring fictional clarification to someone more used to a different playstyle.\n<blockquote>One thing, though -- although an explicit, unmistakable rule is indeed treated as a final authority at this table, rules are definitely <i>not</i> the GM's starting point.  He didn't mention a single rule about hexes or movement or bull-rush etc. when making his determination.  Maybe some rules informed his judgment, maybe not, but he certainly didn't reference them aloud.</blockquote>\nMaybe he just didn't know or recall the relevant rules at the time. Pathfinder has a lot of rules, and it can be difficult to remember to apply them rigorously.<br/><br/>This, together with Pathfinder's general design philosophy that characters can try almost anything, but are only really good at stuff they really apply themselves to, means that it's not entirely unreasonable for a GM to rule that if your character tries something you don't know the rules for, it should probably go wrong.\n<blockquote>If he wanted to punish me for poor rules-use, then I wish he'd clued me in to the fact that that was happening.  I'm guessing, though, that he simply formed a vision of the fiction in which it was a dumb move, and arbitrated as per that vision.</blockquote>\nI don't know the people involved, but I'm not sure a typical Pathfinder player even shares so much vocabulary with a typical story gamer. Are you sure your GM even thinks in terms of "poor rules-use decision" vs. "poor action-in-the-fiction decision"?\n<blockquote>The fact that Will didn't jump in with the Bull Rush rules makes me guess that rules-lawyering generally isn't worth it to this group, and that poking the GM's authority in that way might be unwelcome. </blockquote>\nThat's a good observation.\n<blockquote>But perhaps I can find a polite way around it.

(Will's the guy at the table who I actually knew before I joined, and is much more chill than the GM.)</blockquote>\nMaybe just ask Will straight up for his opinion on the matter? Should you learn and stick to the rules? Should you ask for more clarification? Does the fiction have a bearing on results?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The GM as

The one character (IC) won't like it and their player... may or may not like it, but this sure doesn't seem like it's to the detriment of anyone else.  Or at least, the intent wasn't.

I asked whether he (Will) ever jumps in with a rule, and he said, "Yeah, but in the case of pushing a character, the Bull Rush rules aren't clear about what happens when you push one PC into another PC's square.  But there are other times when I'll jump in with a rule and the GM will go by that.  Unless we think the rule is really, really stupid."  <br/><br/>I asked Will what the GM goes by when a situation isn't governed by a clear rule.  "Whatever makes sense to him," he said.  I asked whether that meant positioning &amp; whatnot in the fiction, and Will shrugged, "I guess."<br/><br/>"So how about this," I asked.  "Before pushing the guy, I could ask whether it looks like there's room to push him past the woman, or is the tunnel too narrow for that?  Would that be cool to ask?  Would it help?"<br/><br/>Will's response: "It might help.  There's a pretty good chance.  It's definitely cool to ask.  We've had plenty of arguments about stuff like that in the past; I try to keep them short now."<br/><br/>So, pretty compatible with my own reads and guesses.  I think part of the GM logic of throwing "gotchas" at players is a sort of friendly punishment for not thinking of relevant factors.  I remember a bit of this from my own high school GMing.  So perhaps if I make it clear to the GM, not just that I'm thinking, but precisely <i>what</i> I'm thinking <i>about</i>, he'll give me credit for that.  I think I'm going to try that before initiating any private chat with him.<br/><br/>We haven't played in the last two weeks -- maybe tomorrow, or Thursday, or next Tuesday.

In social contract terms, in 80% of the groups that Ihave played, making another player's character do something against the will of his/her player is bad etiquette. Though it happens everywhere and the forced actions vary from a shove or less to total unbelievable crap, the thing is that there are some people more sensitive than others at these things.<br/><br/>Could it be that the GM went over the rules and player agency to punish Michael or even maybe you both?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444486/#Comment_444486" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-30T22:58:41+00:00" title="March 30, 2015 10:58PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2015 11:00PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh no, this is <i>definitely</i> not a game where "you can't shove my guy!"

So, sometimes, the relevant info is already established on the map, and sometimes it isn't.  Same deal with movement squares -- we've counted them when it seemed important, and hand-waved them at other times.  My takeaway from chats with Will and observing the GM is that pointing at the grid and asking, "What's the rule for entering an occupied square?" would eventually produce a concrete answer, but not without some awkwardness.<br/><br/>As long as it's plausible that either focus might work (fiction with a side of minis/map/rules vs minis/map/rules alone), my preference will always be to involve the fiction.  Personally, I think Pathfinder makes for a pretty poor board game, and I have no desire to nudge this group toward playing it as such.<br/><br/>I get your point about the appeal of concreteness, and if were entering a group which had mastered the art of using Pathfinder rules and concrete map positions to produce super-fun encounters, I would be totally on board to do it that way.  This isn't that group, though.  We're adventuring in a cave with various slopes and curves and changes in elevation, and the GM is uninterested in establishing them all in advance and communicating them to the players via map drawings or otherwise.  We're working with a 2D sketch and little else.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a>, yeah, the "fictional positioning" terminology would probably have made Will go "Huh?"  My real-life version of asking whether the GM judges according to fictional stuff was much longer and more full of examples.  I am confident that Will understood exactly what I was asking, and I'm taking his reply, "I guess," literally.  Will isn't too concerned with what the GM's rationale is, can't easily pin it down, and would do no more than guess that it's based substantially on the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444678/#Comment_444678" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T20:33:49+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  8:33PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2015 8:35PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We finally got another session in.  It was great fun!  I suppose this will just sound like bragging, but I present it as an illustration of our success getting on the same page:<br/><br/>After the session (Adam is the GM):<br/><br/>Adam: So, that "poison" the casino owner sold you turned out to be oregano.  Or, y'know, the local equivalent.  The actual toxic thing in the bugglegrubble you made was just the fire beetle corpses!<br/><br/>Me: Ha ha ha!  And maybe the oregano made it smell a little better and go down a little easier?<br/><br/>Everyone laughs.<br/><br/>Will: Dave, I'm glad you joined this group, otherwise we would have just slogged through the combat until we'd eventually killed all the gremlins.<br/><br/>Daniel: Yeah.<br/><br/>Me: Heh, thanks!  That certainly would have been faster...<br/><br/>Adam: Who cares about speed?  We already have three good stories from half a module!  How often does that happen?!<br/><br/>Despite the fact that my idea to charge into gremlin territory, abduct one of them, and learn their defenses, numbers and weaknesses didn't actually work as planned, it did springboard us into a lot of fun stuff.  The combat to abduct the gremlin was nicely different from the previous combats; the subsequent interrogation gave the GM some opportunities to colorfully drive home how dumb and vicious the gremlins are; our "allies" who did the interrogating (the party doesn't speak Gremlin) got fed up with us; and it was actually the final question from Daniel that bore fruit:<br/><br/>Daniel: What do you eat?<br/><br/>Adam (as Gremlin): Bugglegrubble!<br/><br/>I think Adam spit that out somewhat at random, but he seemed to get a kick out of us breaking down what it probably meant (bugs and grubs), and Will's dumb orc Thokk suddenly made it a point of pride that he made GREAT bugglegrubble.  This led to some hilarious in-town prep, my testing our poison on a rat (which threw up but didn't die), and then Daniel stealthily lacing the gremlins' turf with the stuff.  Once Daniel made all his stealth checks to put the poisoned food out there, I don't think Adam even gave the gremlins intelligence checks to avoid the food or constitution checks to expel it with no harm taken; instead, he simply ruled that when we next charged their tunnels, they were all in the midst of puking and the outcome of the fight was a foregone conclusion.  So we just skipped ahead to the big boss fight at the end (which we won handily).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444680/#Comment_444680" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T20:38:24+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  8:38PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>That does sound like fun!

Did Will say something to Adam?  I don't know.  <br/><br/>I think we've begun training each other in a constructive direction, though.  When I wanted to know something covered by the rules, I led off by talking about the rules rather then the fiction (this is how we pulled off gremlin-abduction -- while Will invoked the grappling rules, I invoked the rule that denies the gremlins their flanking bonus if Will and I are standing back to back in the same square).  When I wanted to do something more nebulous, I focused on steering toward stuff that amused the group and/or incorporated the GM's contributions.  This was not a calculated process or anything, just a growing association between entertainment value and effectiveness.  <br/><br/>The next time I want to push one character in front of another, I will:<br/>1) check on the relevant rules<br/>2) if the rules leave a lot of room for interpretation, I will try to make my desired outcome as entertaining as possible<br/>3) if I fail to make it entertaining, I will then expect a high probability of the GM throwing a "gotcha" at me, and either (a) embrace my character's ill fortune and enjoy the GM's gotcha, or (b) not push one character in front of another.<br/><br/>I think some combo of (1) this approach, (2) me having seen that sometimes the GM does like my goofy ideas, and (3) the GM having seen that my goofy ideas can be a lot of fun, ought to (a) keep the "roll thinking I might achieve my intent, but have that not be the case" stuff to a minimum, and (b) allow me to comfortably roll with it when it does come up, knowing that it'll be rare.<br/><br/>I could be wrong and the reality could be that it just depends on whether Adam's in a good mood that day, but the above is what I'm going with for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444718/#Comment_444718" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T17:10:23+00:00" title="April  9, 2015  5:10PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice breakdown, Dave!

I was DM. The game system was 5e, using only the Starter Set booklets + pregens + a module that was 90% home made but based on a downloaded map.<br/><br/>The players were fighting a MintyFresh\u2122 brand nanite cleaning apparatus that took harm from some damage types and benefited from others (cutting &amp; electrical). Some of the players had suspected this quality but one of the players took a swing at it with his sword. The other players started yelling "noooo, don't" and he was like "Oh, wait, no, I don't, after all" and I'm thinking: what's done is done. So I turned toward the one player that had protested the most and said: "You can stop him iff you spend a full action. Do you do it? y/n" and he agonized over the decision and then landed on "Yes, I stop him". I gave him insp and turned to the other half of the table. "OK, they both have used their turns. What do you do?"<br/><br/>I was happy &amp; satisified with the call. <br/><br/>I had a vaguely misremembered version of this threads OP in mind and didn't want any "You stumble around, you shove him too hard" etc etc (I'm ever vigilant against "slapstick D&amp;D"). Shades of PbtA "Offer them a choice". Also keeping the discussion of "intent/initiation/execution/effect" in mind, but only in mind. We didn't go through these steps in detail; I tried to shortcut around it. Obviously their ultimate intent is to survive the MintyFresh\u2122 apparatus' attempts at "cleaning" them, but in a more medium-grained sense of turn to turn, I think I sussed it out.<br/><br/>I could've gone somewhere with the grappling rules, die rolls etc etc. Remember, the stoppee wanted to be stopped, he started hesitating. (That's a difference from the cowardly PC in the OP.) I could also have been more generous and considering the party's shouts of "No" as free actions and just said to the stoppee "Sure, what do you want to do instead?".<br/><br/>Also emblematic of my style as we didn't dwell on specific descriptions of the stopping or how the stopping physically took place, how close the cutter had come to actually putting blade to the apparatus etc. It was just a "Yes" and a quick move on to the other side of the table. I have this theory that the players' brains fill in these gaps; what matters are the actions, the stakes etc. Creating and maintaining buy-in in mechanics &amp; system is a big part of that.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> It wasn't for fear of the grappling rules that I made that call. We were using those rules successfully later when they were fighting an instantiation of a Vampirocubes\u2122 Guard Patrol (a swarm of flying metal cubes, about 4\xd74\xd74 inches, that exsanguinate entities that have insufficient clearance level for presence in the facilities). I hadn't run a game in such a long time (hence why I only brought the Starter Set booklets) but once we got going, I didn't have to reference them, I remembered the rules. Except I forgot to remind the party to scratch rations every day. In the end they found a food source so they were never in any risk of starvation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461452/#Comment_461452" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-26T13:30:37+00:00" title="March 26, 2017  1:30PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2017 1:50PM by 2097.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Later in the very same fight against the MintyFresh\u2122 apparatus another player forgot himself and struck it again with swords. I stated the effects (beneficial to the apparatus) and he was like "But I didn't roll, maybe I'll miss, maybe I'll miss" and hoped to miss. I was miffed at that. I don't see misses as "hitting beside the enemy", I see it as the attack being good but the enemy's armor or dodging being superior, and in this case MintyFresh\u2122's highly cost-efficient neural net programming had evolved a reaction to swords that doesn't involve AC. He rolled anyway despite me saying "don't roll". I dropped the argument because he rolled exactly the AC (so, not missing), so we would've been arguing over a hypothetical failed roll, and life is short. But internally the furnace of my hatred was stoked with an approximate 21050(\xb1125)\xb0C (\u0394-increase from its then current temperature).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461454/#Comment_461454" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-26T14:10:12+00:00" title="March 26, 2017  2:10PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

I mean, unless the game's gone completely formalistic, it still presumably has the idea that a character's AC is a function of both their armor and their defensive movement. It follows that, if the game allows circumstance modifiers to rolls, it's possible to assign an appropriate modifier for the fact that their armor is "useless" against the attack you're making (on the principle that it suffices to hit the armor here, no vital strike necessary). Once you're at that point it's strictly a matter of taste whether you write down the "touch AC" or just recalculate it as needed.<br/><br/>As an interesting aside, I generally break down D&amp;D's strike difficulty (that is, how difficult it is to score a hit in melee) for an unarmored average human target in a dueling situation in this way:<br/><b>25%</b> comes from their being a moving target you have to account for in time and space. Immobilizing the enemy removes this factor.<br/><b>25%</b> comes from their being aware of the danger and reacting to it with dodging, parrying, riposting, etc. The enemy being unaware of the attack would eliminate this factor.<br/><b>50%</b> comes from the technical difficulty of delivering a strong enough strike to cause injury. One could call this "natural AC", although humans being relatively unarmored it's more about the difficulty of wielding your weapon effectively. This factor could be mitigated by the enemy being larger (makes aiming easier) or frailer (so a weaker strike suffices), for example, but it would only be dropped entirely in a situation where even an incompetent could not fail to hit effectively.<br/><br/>This sort of rule of thumb helps me in accounting for appropriate modifiers when e.g. a character is surprised by an invisible foe, or they're entangled yet aware of a danger, or when they're completely helpless, yet you don't have time to stop and execute them with care. For example, in my own homebrew the default unarmored armor class is 20, so -5 is appropriate if you are unaware of the danger and another -5 if you can't move; the difficulty of hitting a training dummy (something that does not move or react) is 10, which in this system is generally achievable for anybody with a smidgen of training.<br/><br/>But that's more of a curio than the actual topic, isn't it? The actual phenomenon of players occasionally being big cry-babies is familiar to me. It annoys the hell out of me when they try to <i>wriggle</i> out of something in the game, as if it were a game of, I don't know, GM-debating. Seems like spitting in my face when a player so flaunts how they care more about winning than due process. My main strategy in dealing with these kinds of debates is to state the applicable rules principle clearly, explain what the player could have done better to avoid the disagreement, and then suggest a compromise in the player's advantage in exchange for their agreeing to follow proper process in the future. I view any situation where I win long-term a victory, even if I lose short-term, and it's not even losing really, because the players will generally be more than happy to take this deal.<br/><br/>So e.g. in Sandra's situation above, I'd let the player take back their attack statement in exchange for them promising not to do it again - or if they do, they stick to it. This specific situation is actually pretty common for me, I get it several times per year when some player lapses (or is inexperienced) and does the take-back. Just as Sandra describes, it makes for a difficult procedural dead-lock when a player declares an action, the GM describes the consequences, and then the player wants to take back what they said on the virtue of "saying it by accident"; the GM already revealed the consequences, so the tactical process is contaminated if you're allowed to "go back in time" and make a new choice. On account of my "win long-term" principle I explain to the other players why this bothers me, and get the player to promise that they'll be more careful in the future, but not try to assign any immediate penalties. This makes for a more relaxed game, I find, as the players don't have to treat me as an enemy they need to win a debate; they just need to keep making social commitments to me about being better players in the future.

One of my home players (not a participant in this game) who was a 3e veteran protested at first but started liking the change after a while.<br/><br/>This monster quickly splits itself in half to avoid sword cuts, that's the benefit of it receiving cutting (I tried to be vague but I realize it's not likely someone here is going to play in this particular game anyway so why avoid spoiler).<br/><br/>In 3e, if a monster's armor doesn't matter but it's nimbleness does matter, it's "touch AC". If it's nimbleness doesn't matter but it's armor does matter, it's "flatfooted AC". In 5e both of those have been removed and it's gone more formalistic.<br/>But, in this case, neither would've mattered. The nanite contraption <i>wants</i> to be attacked with swords. So there's no missing it and a normal attack roll against AC just isn't relevant.<br/><br/>I could've done a more generous "Yes or roll the dice" by making either some sort of physical (dex?) save for the player to in the last minute steer their sword away, or some sort of mental save "roll to see if you realize it in time" thing. Or, and this is something I didn't realize at the time (remember this was a split-second argument, I was like "nooo, don't rooooll" in slomo as they grabbed their die and rolled it, against my explicit call), I could've done some other sort of arrangement as the previous one where I allowed someone to give up their full action, along with the stoppee's full action. It was the last thing in that initiative round, but, I could've thought of the turns as "an endlessly wrapping sequence of turns" instead of "everyone goes, then a new round starts". Mental lock in action, I guess.<br/><br/>But, my instinct was to just stick with the stated action. It was their third chance already.\n<blockquote>It follows that,</blockquote>\nYour statement follows the premise that the AC is a function of armor and defensive movement. Which isn't strictly true for all entities anymore and the various AC:s in 3e have been removed.\n<blockquote>if the game allows circumstance modifiers to rolls</blockquote>\nThat's not a standard function in the game, instead there's the "advantage" &amp; "disadvantage" mechanic. I know you played LMoP where you were a trainlock so I don't mean to explain things you already might now, but, just to make sure. There are specific things that give roll modifiers (cover is the most commonly used one of these) but it's not a general mechanic.\n<blockquote>it's possible to assign an appropriate modifier for the fact that their armor is "useless" against the attack you're making (on the principle that it suffices to hit the armor here, no vital strike necessary). Once you're at that point it's strictly a matter of taste whether you write down the "touch AC" or just recalculate it as needed.</blockquote>\nYes, 8. Which the player thankfully rolled exactly. But. It doesn't want to be missed.<br/><br/>Many groups narrate their D&amp;D blows like "oh shit my sword swung like two meters to the left of the foe", which I hate. I want the clashing swords, Robin Hood / Zorro / Obi-Wan style until someone falls or gives up. They're not "missing", the enemy is just defending itself so well. For example I might say "Your arrow flies straight into the creature but its thick fur catches it".\n<blockquote>As an interesting aside, I generally break down D&amp;D's strike difficulty (that is, how difficult it is to score a hit in melee) for an unarmored average human target in a dueling situation in this way:<br/><b>25%</b> comes from their being a moving target you have to account for in time and space.

It eats the candy" and then they say "No wait let me roll a dexterity check to be able to place the candy there properly, maybe I clumsily fall on my shoelaces before I even reach the center of the room where the table is" and I say no and they roll anyway. It's annoying! If they asked for a roll to be competent and avoid it nimbly or catch themself mentally, like "I roll to see if I can remember that it's a mimic" it would've been much less annoying! I don't like to roll for things that feels like they just <i>should</i> succeed. To do it, do it.<br/><br/>So e.g. in Sandra's situation above, I'd let the player take back their attack statement in exchange for them promising not to do it again - or if they do, they stick to it.<br/><br/>It was the third strike. The second time was the "No, stop" "You can stop him if you spend a full action, do you do it? y/n" exchange above. Which I was happy with because it's super difficult to come up with good dilemmas for PbtA games.\n<blockquote>the GM already revealed the consequences, so the tactical process is contaminated if you're allowed to "go back in time" and make a new choice.</blockquote>\nThis, 100%.<br/><br/>I have another story that really bugged me <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/>(Post is too long, so I'll split it)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461467/#Comment_461467" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-26T18:41:28+00:00" title="March 26, 2017  6:41PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was playing Caylus with two guys, one of whom I knew a little bit (he is a guy we have many funny anecdotes about because he is quite a personality, but in general I like him even if I haven't played with him in a while), let's call him C because that's his initial, and his friend whom I've never met before or since, whom I don't remember the name but I'm going to call him Tea because he brought very expensive delicious green tea which he boiled (which you're not supposed to do) and it became bitter and it was a bit of a waste and he seemed to think that that was how that tea was supposed to taste like. <small>All in the audience who now mentally shake their heads and grumble that 2097 is a judgmental b----, to you I can only say "\u2665\u2665\u2665, you know me so well".</small><br/><br/>Anyway, the game was over, the final round was finished, Tea wrapped up his turn and passed. I was leading and would've won. I rarely win Caylus, I find it a very difficult and counter-intuitive game for me (it's one of the few euros I like, though). And I asked, "Oh, are you done?" He said yes. "Oh, good, because then I can say that you could've done this-that-and-the-other to win, I was so nervous that you would've seen it." He said "...Oh. You're right". And then C said "Oh, don't worry, Tea, we'll let you take it back, I'm feeling generous" and then Tea lit up and rewinded his whole turn and then implemented the strategy I had mentioned and won the game. And I was like... I didn't say anything, but I thought "WTF!? I <i>explicitly</i> waited until he had passed his turn before mentioning anything. And, I regret saying it because it was a smug, dumb thing to point out and it was childish. But, just it was just a passing curiosity, too. To say "I was on needles because I thought you were going to see this particular convoluted plan, but luckily I won, phew", was been slightly rude but I think it's acceptable. Notably C didn't see that plan either, until I explained it to them. It sucked.<br/><br/>I have another C story (I have about twenty stories about him but I don't want him to recognize this. I like him well enough, he's a cool guy but we have very very different board game philosophies and I often bring up C anecdotes to contrast with my own philosophy when we make up house rules at home). This took place maybe one or two years before the Caylus story and was the second or third time I met him. We were playing Power Grid and he passed his turn. I left my chair and walked around the table to get a better look at the board and I was staring very visibly at an area of the map where I was thinking of building, and trying to do the math. After I had pondered for a while, C interrupted me and took back his entire turn and started doing something else. He explained his table rule that anyone can take back their turn "if they haven't seen any future" (which is the phrase he always uses). But I felt that I had stared at that particular part of the board so intently.... and for a while (math is hard)... that it had contaminated the tactical process and also that all of my analysis and calculations would have to start over since he redid his turn. And it was the first time I ever heard of this "haven't seen any future" meta-rule. What happened was that a guy who later became a friend of mine, Johan, started a shouting fight with him and they argued back and forth until Johan wiped the pieces of the board and I left. I hadn't dared say anything, I had been petrified in silence &amp; fear [remember, this was the first, second or third time meeting many of these guys] but I left very upset. (BTW, I later told them that I wasn't upset at Johan for wiping the tables but for C to be so obstinate and argumentative. But later I became friends with them both.) Both me, C and Johan thought we had a very good shot at winning the game, but later another player explained that he had the game in the bag regardless of what we did. (That last player, M let's call him, is part of my home D&amp;D group btw.) OTOH, we all thought we had a shot so I'm not sure M's theory would've been correct, but, it might very well have been, he has a great Power Grid track record and I certainly don't.<br/><br/>I don't like the "haven't seen any future" meta rule. Instead, the rule we use, at least when we play with familiar people that have heard our typical meta rules &amp; table rules, is that you can always petition for a takeback but it's up to the other players -- unanimously -- to gracefully grant a takeback. (In late games, it's granted about 20% of the time, I'd say) It's their gift to give. Future or no future, contaminated or not contaminated. Because it always sort of is, at least in my experience. Subtly, sometimes.<br/><br/>Another one of C's meta rules is that if a die touches two surfaces, like it's half on a playing card and half on thet able, it's completely rerolled. It can get pretty ridiculous sometimes if the playing cards are very thin. My own preference is that if one side is visibly "more" face up, that's the side.  Like even if it was at a 40\xb0 angle, at the side of the dice tray, I wouldn't want it rerolled. Only if it was 45\xb0. I mean, there is a very simple test: can everyone agree which side looks more "up"? If so, no reroll. If there is any disagreement (feigned or otherwise, but that has never happened, that mythical 45\xb0 has never happened), then reroll. OTOH, some people like to "bump" it to settle it, I hate that! (B/c it might very well fall in the other direction.) And it's something they do without discussion and it's impossible to undo, to. I'm like "hey I didn't even see what it was before you bumped it, stop it!"<br/>I later learned that in Backgammon, there are strict rules for rerolling dice even for things like they are touching each other -- even if both are on a flat surface. So, that's a little bit of grist for C's argument, I must admit. And I do follow those rules for Backgammon but for Backgammon only.<br/><br/>My dad's rule was always that if a die leaves the table, it's rerolled. Something I changed as soon as I could. For a long time I called his rule "the Finnish die rule" because that's where I thought he got it, until I learned that it's common in many places.

Hence my preferred meta rule that takebacks are sola gratia, and never de jure. The granter's mood matters too, like if it's the late game tensions run high and the ego and stinginess grows: it's harder to grant a takeback then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461484/#Comment_461484" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-27T13:46:56+00:00" title="March 27, 2017  1:46PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your stories about your boardgaming microculture. It's interesting how different it is from ours:<br/><b>*</b> Takebacks are totally a thing; the rule is basically your "haven't seen the future" concept, except we express it in terms of "irreversible entropy of the game state". Boils down to takebacks being allowed as long as no dice rolls or card draws have been made, and no new information has been revealed to anybody. (That includes game choices made by other players, of course: if somebody already declared a move based on yours, entropy has occurred, because you have been contaminated with private knowledge about the other person's tactical perspective.) It would not be wrong to say that we consider all moves merely suggestive as long as nobody "finalizes" the spastic fumbling with the game pieces by making a new move on top of the old one. Quite different from the traditional Chess principle of "you touch it, you play it" <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><b>*</b> We generally value the abstract challenge of the game more than winning, which in practice means that it's quite common for players to advice and instruct each other on optimal moves to make. In multiplayer games this is of course often enough the undocumented "diplomacy action" (trying to influence another player to move in a way that is advantageous to you), but it tends to be accepted as part of the game and a positive influence overall (it improves the general level of play). It is particularly significant that we value "trivial" victories much lower than fundamental differences in skill, which is why players are commonly allowed to fix stupid play, so as to provide a greater challenge for the others - they want to win with their own clever play, not because the other player was playing lazily.<br/><b>*</b> The very concept of victory has become pretty hazy over the years, particularly after I did a weird deconstruction on the concept of "king-making" years ago. Nowadays it's not uncommon for us to have a "technical victor", which may not count for much in terms of peer appreciation if the win was gained on mere technicality. It is even more common for a game to end in an outcome like "player A became the kingmaker, with B and C as the pretenders". You might read the latter case as a "tie between B and C" if you want, but it's not like we really need to assign labels to the play experience, you know <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><b>*</b> I feel the need to cap this weird list of our strangeness with the note that we <i>do</i> have a very disciplined play environment, it's just not very naive and authentic about "winning" and such. More often than not you win because of luck or somebody else playing badly, and it's interesting to understand exactly what is going on; the real victory condition is to become a consistently better player, or to progress the collective strategic understanding of the game, and not so much simply to win this game here and now.<br/><br/>In general, though, it seems to me that your group might benefit from discussing gaming philosophy a bit more openly. Like, get more discipline in there, decide what's fair play and what's not. I know that this is more difficult for a peer group (much easier if there is a clear social leader like in e.g. scout troops have), but boldness and listening to other viewpoints helps a lot. Once you have some generally accepted principles in place, it's easier to resolve the specific fouls with callbacks to the general principles. "Hey, do you think that what you're doing is good gamesmanship? Didn't we all agree that part of the fun in doing this is discipline? I don't like that we're abandoning discipline at a whim here."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461485/#Comment_461485" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-27T13:57:37+00:00" title="March 27, 2017  1:57PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Quite different from the traditional Chess principle of "you touch it, you play it" <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nYour philosophy is similar to C:s, then.<br/>I took baduk lessons for a little while and my teacher used to say (in baduk, pondering future moves is called 'reading') "Read with your eyes, not with your hands" and that's something that stuck with me as a good thing.\n<blockquote>We generally value the abstract challenge of the game more than winning, which in practice means that it's quite common for players to advice and instruct each other on optimal moves to make.</blockquote>\nAlso similar to C!

The example with the "I want to roll, maybe I miss the MintyFresh after all" was a con game, and all those C stories were long ago. And, they're quite useful as reference when I've been dictating my own preferences. "Remember when C said this or that? Well, rather, I think that or this instead." And we'd construe exaggerated examples like C's rule of die rolls are only legit when they're on one surface, and examples have come up when it's on a playing card or something. And in our imagination he would stretch it to different colors of paint even, or something ludicrous like that and we'd have a smile about that. I mean, it's meant as a positive thing because he has done lots to build a euro gaming culture here. I just wanted to do it another way, one that made more sense to me. (And, one of C:s friends is a bit of a bad egg.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461510/#Comment_461510" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-29T03:52:12+00:00" title="March 29, 2017  3:52AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2017 3:53AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The discussion of "house rules", or the approach to dealing with "takebacks" is interesting to me, here, because there are two approaches which are being presented as different takes on the matter. However, when I play boardgames, I would use both.<br/><br/>What does that mean? Generally, I strive to encourage people to make it really clear when their turn is over. (For example, pass the dice to the next player to indicate that you've finished your turn.)<br/><br/>However, sometimes a person has an idea and they want to "do over". Do we allow this? If the next person hasn't made any moves yet, generally we will. However, it depends on the situation: we very, very much consider it a special favour to allow a "take back". It's never your right, in other words; you ask for the kindness of the group to allow you a chance to change a move you made.<br/><br/>In practice, it's pretty easy. The person asks; then we look at the person whose turn is being interrupted. If they seem uneasy or unhappy about it (or if anyone does, really), we don't allow it. If they're happy to let the person change their move, then we go ahead.<br/><br/>Interesting thread; it's been fun to reread it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461512/#Comment_461512" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-29T04:58:05+00:00" title="March 29, 2017  4:58AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty much like my favored approach as well.
