One of them is an experienced D&amp;D &amp; Call of Cthulhu player, the other two are both experienced video game players (one plays EVE, the other plays Skyrim)... and here is the best part, every single one of us is an artist.  3 of us are professionals.  I am always the only artist.  This is so cool.<br/><br/>So at our working Thursday lunch (we all hang out and bring artwork to work on at a coffee shop), I brought up tabletop RPGing and if anyone was interested.  Everyone was.  I threw out a couple of non-fantasy pitches knowing that S., the experienced one, liked mysteries , but what it morphed into is wanting a gonzo, floating cities, weird magics, alien cultures, something to inspire us as artists.  D&amp;D tropes were to be avoided by table consent (and I didn't even bring it up)... so cliche'd dungeons are out.  All three of them were interested in roleplaying more.  They WANT characters and interactions with the world.  They have not been exposed to "Indie games".  Maybe it is Exalted, but without that system.  I don't want to run Exalted.  That way lies Exhaustion.  <br/><br/>So my first instinct is FATE, I already own Legends of Anglerre.   I think Aspects are gold to be mined, especially with players who feel straightjacketed by D&amp;D not allowing (easily) for a lot of social conflict stuff or interesting uses of powers and magics or broad applications of stats and skills without handwaving.  <br/><br/>But I think LoA is a bit cookie cutter with its magic.  Its not evocative enough or weird enough for the vibe I want to get to.  And I don't want to do a lot of heavy lifting writing up/hacking magic rules<br/><br/>I think Burning Wheel is too complex for a transition from D&amp;D for new players, too grounded in "reality".<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Grocery List--</span> what this campaign should have in terms of elements...<br/>*  Something faster that 4th Ed D&amp;D.  Something mechanically elegant<br/>*  Some kind of player narrative control (Fate pts w/ Aspects, Artha in BW etc).<br/>*  Powerful player characters<br/>*  Cool, weird, evocative magic<br/>*  Easy to run<br/>*  System lends itself to flavor<br/><br/>So, any system out there y'all would suggest?<br/><br/>I am looking at Other Worlds as a possibility.  Gotta peruse the magic section...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364522/#Comment_364522" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T05:25:59+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  5:25AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 5:26AM by Teataine.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Soft Horizon sounds like it would be a perfect fit for this, but sadly that game isn't out yet.<br/><br/>Have you considered Sorcerer, with the Sorcerer &amp; Sword and Dictionary of Mu as supplements?

If not, then <i>Polaris</i>, <i>Mountain Witch</i> and similar games are flavourful, elegant and in general do a good job in this regard.<br/><br/>In the dramatic/narrative adventure game niche my go-to recommendations are <i>Burning Wheel</i>, <i>FATE</i>, <i>TSoY</i> and <i>Heroquest</i> (and <i>Apocalypse World</i> nowadays, too - it belongs in this family). These all except Heroquest share a degree of complexity, but both FATE and TSoY can be shorn down into the Heroquest range if you want that. FATE and Heroquest lean more towards static characters the players predefine carefully and then depict in play, while BW and TSoY are more towards the dramatic end where play is pretty much about character discovery and the impact your choices have on your character. I myself find the methodology of play to be sufficiently similar between these that as long as you're clear on your creative agenda (whether you're going to be challenging or affirming the players' character concepts, pretty much), there is no significant difference in quality between these games: just pick the one with the mechanical aesthetics you like best, and use the common methodical toolset they share to GM well.<br/><br/><i>Other Worlds</i> is, I understand, very close to Heroquest. Unless something important has been changed, it belongs in the above category of dramatic adventure games that share a rough toolbox of good GMing practices. I haven't read it, but unless it's very different from its antecedents it should be a fine choice for anybody who grogs its specific dice mechanics etc. and likes the idea of working with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364533/#Comment_364533" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T06:16:11+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  6:16AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I<br/><br/><sup>1</sup>Solar System!</blockquote>\nYeah, I was going to say The Shadow of Yesterday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364537/#Comment_364537" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T06:36:52+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  6:36AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 6:37AM by Ludanto.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "magic system" in Other Worlds is a non-system.

The team was a bunch of underpowered wimpy self-appointed guardians of a distant bedroom community suburb of Paragon City. Plus, in the fiction, they developed their adventures into a self-published indie comic book that they made themselves.<br/><br/>So about 3 sessions in, I told them that one of the problems they had to solve for the day was the fact that they hadn't finished the last page or cover of their next installment yet, and needed to do it right now. I put out paper and some art supplies and said "Go". They had a lot of fun making a page and a cover together, talking/arguing in character the whole time.<br/><br/>With a table full of artists, I think it would be awesome if you would take advantage of those strengths.<br/><br/>Like maybe one aspect of the customized magic system would be that if they draw a picture of their target, the spell works better.<br/><br/>Or perhaps, by creating appropriate sketches, the players can generate the equivilant of fan mail points that they can give to other players to help them with their rolls.<br/><br/><br/>Also...<br/><br/>Another thing to consider - you don't need to jump right in to a campaign straight off.<br/><br/>I think it might be a good idea to try out a few different things first. Take a wack at some games that are one-shot or micro-campaign oriented. Things like Mountain Witch. Or Dogs in the Vineyard (which, yes, can be a campaign, but which works exceptionally well for one shots as well).<br/><br/>Get your feet wet. Try some stuff. See what they like.<br/><br/>As artists, you're all familiar with the concept that great works have underlying fundamentals - color, shading, perspective, brush techniques, etc. Roleplaying is a similar sort of creative act, but with fundamentals that many of your players are not yet familiar with. Playing various one shot or three shot games can help you build an array of fundamental skills that you can then bring to bear on a larger work - a campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364607/#Comment_364607" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T09:56:38+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  9:56AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, if you have a group of artists who like playing games, you might consider playing 1000 Blank White Cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364628/#Comment_364628" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T10:51:30+00:00" title="March  2, 2012 10:51AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have already thought of first session, sitting down with a 11x17 piece of paper where I have drawn the outline of a continent, a few islands, but blank beyond that.  Then I will put down one map element <i>{example:  little icon of a city, title:  White Necropolis.

Table consensus will be needed.  So if everyone thinks a crashed space station in a fantasy game is crossing the line, no crashed space station.

I like it, simply the easiest game I've ever run.  But it was a bit bland.  I couldn't quite get the combat to sing, the mechanics didn't quite engage us.  However, making NPCs on the fly that were evocative was the easiest of any system ever.  We had a good run.  But I don't want to return to that.... again, magic is kind of the hang up for me.  It was very low key and sword and sorcery ( I don't know about 7 skies).  And I'm not really all that interested in swashbuckly kind of vibe unless the players are... and that can be easily handled as well in LoA.  <br/><br/>I have re-looked at LoA.  There are a couple of things that I missed the first time I ran it, like Wild Magic.  Wild Magic is waaay cool and perfect for the Sorcery Storms that sometimes wrack the land.  Also, I'm thinking you can take any Magic stunts currently and as a freebie, take on voluntary Consequences to make bigger spells... giving Magic a real ooomph! to be very nasty in-game, but at quite the cost.  On top of that, I think I want Summoning to be relatively easy and widespread in the various societies (although what they summon can differ quite a bit).  But Summon things want to negotiate their terms of service... leading to some role playing.  <br/><br/>and then I never know, maybe all three players will want to play swordsmen and fighter types.  And then the magic becomes really the domain of me , the gm.  <br/><br/>I'm sorry to take y'all on a circular journey.  But I think I will stick with LoA.  I was hoping there was something out there that was easy, quick and flavorful, but Sorcerer doesn't do it for me.  TSOY is a FATE game as far as I am concerned, sure there are some differences, but they are minor to me.  LoA has a lot more bells and whistles, like nations at war guidelines and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364729/#Comment_364729" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T17:24:41+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  5:24PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is <i>Dungeon World</i> too tied to the D&amp;D tropes for you guys?

Haven't played it.  Seems to me from the outside that player's "books" of moves are very much aimed at nostalgia, "dungeon" experiences.  Am I wrong?  But it seems to me that Dungeon World's design goals is to do D&amp;D simpler and better than D&amp;D itself.  It also seems to plug into that 'zero to hero' overall arc for PCs.  So, PCs start out relatively competent, but not necessarily a Conan or Grey Mouser or an Elric, Corum, Hawkmoon.  <br/><br/>So I am not sure it can handle starting at larger than life characters from the get-go. <br/><br/>Barbarians is a fine game.  I've never played it, but I've read it.  I'm just not sure it is a good fit. But kind of like Jaws, the magic is really aimed at being in the hands of the "bad guys" and magic is subtle and very much Conan Sword and Sorcery vibe.  From our discussion the other day, I think magic is going to be in every fibre of the societies the PCs encounter.  It is going to be woven through the entire narrative.  And it might be controlled by one or all three PCs.<br/><br/>I realize, I've done something rather stupid in this thread.  <br/><br/>I didn't tell you all one of the major tent poles of my fantasy idea.  The Tolkien trope is that magic is ebbing away, the elves are leaving, the day of man has arrived, blah, blah, blah.  I'm SOOOO tired of that paradigm.  This game is:  Magic is at it's height.  This is Atlantis, Shangri-La, 12 Kingdoms, where magic is so integrated into life.  The players want gonzo.  I want to give them gonzo.  Flying cities of brass, Universities of Magic sending out and sponsoring expeditions, warrior-monks armed with Staves of Pain that shoot out ruby rays of repulsion.  A village of summoned, but then discarded homonculli, elementals and demons trying to make a go at a "normal" life.  Magic potions are sold by street vendors and a surprising number of them<b> actually</b> work.  Gremlins are on strike because working on the printing presses for the Gnomes is not paying enough and are threatening to unionize.   Dimensional Gates are used by the rich and powerful as routine as we fly.   Woods that thrive on souls of unwary travellers.  A river god who demands tribute from every boat, canoe and barge that travels its domain.  It is almost superheroes meets sword and planet.  But it is also chaos, things creep out of the spaces from in-between dimensions.  Sorcerer Storms touch down and teleport whole villages to somewhere else, enchant things and people at random or teleport something there.  Gods are born.  Gods die.  Fairly often.  <br/><br/>Taking one thing from 4th Ed, I think the Points of Light idea can kind of work here.  There are pockets of stability, City-States, maybe 1 or 3 nation-states, where societies can function.  But the spaces inbetween?  Oh, it is a dangerous world(s) out there.  PCs are those folks who are tough, brave, smart or stupid enough to try.    I guess it is a little bit like Eberron too, the idea of sorta "modernizing" magic societies...  but I want to cherry pick.  Eberron has always struck me as being to far deep into D&amp;D's pockets, trying to fit and accomodate Halflings, Drow and all the other D&amp;D tropes into a world instead of bringing a lot of its own new flavours.  So, it is Eberron if Eberron was written by the daughter of Moorcock and Vance and who's godfather was Leiber.  <br/><br/>Here are some elements that I've jotted down....<br/><br/>High Fantasy Elements<br/>*  Vale of the Crimson Crystals- where the shy Quartzmen make their home.  <br/>*  Gryphon Parcel-- pony express analog, but on Gryphons.<br/>*  Aboria- Forested nation-state, led by an immortal sorceress who\u2019s health is tied directly into the land and her peoples.  <br/>*  Sorcery Storms-- Maelstroms of magic, like tornadoes, can hit without warning, often teleporting people and things, often enchanting places, peoples or items and other random events without rhyme or reason.  <br/>*  Galvanus- a city -state on a floating island, has a yearly flight path cycle.<br/>*  White Necropolis-  a thriving  city-state of Necromancy that is quite orderly and successful, built on the \u201cslave labor\u201d of the undead servants.  But using Nercromancy for murder or military power is strictly forbidden and will result in death by the Council of Necromancy.  The People of White Necropolis believe that putting their dead to work is revering their memories.<br/><br/>And that is the extent of what I'm going to do as world-building prior to play.  Let the rest come from the players and chargen.  <br/><br/>But I appreciate people trying to point me to systems that might work.  It has made me clarify a few things to myself as I struggle to clarify to others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364819/#Comment_364819" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T06:21:52+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  6:21AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How important is the melee for it to count as fantasy?

We've recently been using AD&amp;D second edition to do some proper old school kobold bashing, which has been a great nostalgia trip for everyone. The OW campaign we've got queued up after it is a very different beast. The PCs are the heroes of their respective races being sent on a last desperate quest by the fantasy equivalent of the UN to investiagte a mysterious island that has just bobbed up to the surface. Meanwhile the unseelie have started to escalate their attacks on the material realm, as part of their cycle of exterminating the most prominent earthly civilisations every three thousand years. The island is actually a weapon created by the last lot of advanced civilisations before they were exterminated. The campaign itself is going to turn into a full-on War of the Ring affair, with the PCs trying to unite the races, defend the major cities, and ultimately probably launch a counter-attack against the unseelie realm itself on the far side of the moon. The future of the world itself is at stake here - will the PCs win, and usher in a new Age of the Sun with their respective races at the helm, or will the PCs lose, and fall into a new Age of Darkness with their races falling into a long and painful extinction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364847/#Comment_364847" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T10:08:06+00:00" title="March  3, 2012 10:08AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite>How important is the melee for it to count as fantasy?

But it seems to me that Dungeon World's design goals is to do D&amp;D simpler and better than D&amp;D itself.  It also seems to plug into that 'zero to hero' overall arc for PCs.  So, PCs start out relatively competent, but not necessarily a Conan or Grey Mouser or an Elric, Corum, Hawkmoon.<br/><br/>So I am not sure it can handle starting at larger than life characters from the get-go.</blockquote>\nYeah, it does D&amp;D better than D&amp;D, but that doesn't necessarily involve dungeons. Most of my D&amp;D games were overland, political, magical mystery, sandboxes, and DW does that fine. It does plug into a model of increasing power, but whether it starts at zero or badass is a matter of colour and tone.

There are two reasons I am not implementing this idea.  1) I've got new gamers and I would rather keep the rules internally consistent for now, not really into Frankenstiening the game systems for them.  2)  SW's magic ain't gonna cut it.  Mages feel like walking artillery.  Now, I don't own Solomon Kane, which I understand has some pretty nifty sword and sorcerer bolt-ons.  But I don't want to buy Solomon Kane for just that.

And it takes away from the idea of us crafting a fantasy setting of our own, cooperatively.<br/><br/>But as source material to steal from, I'm real thankful for the link provided.  I will certainly check some of it out.</blockquote>\nYeah, I could've explained that better. Talislanta is very much the non-D&amp;D non-Tolkien kind of high fantasy setting that you were talking about creating, which is part of the reason I suggested it. However, I wasn't thinking that you should actually just play in the Talislanta setting. Rather, I'm saying take a read through the first few chapters where the rules are actually explained, as I think you may find that it'll give you a lot of what you're looking for, system-wise. In particular, the magic system in the 4th edition may be a lot more amenable to providing the sense of cool, weird, and pervasive magic you're looking for.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Storn</cite><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Grocery List--</span>what this campaign should have in terms of elements...<br/>*  Something faster that 4th Ed D&amp;D.

Done.<br/>* The only bit that may be missing as there's no inherent mechanical system for this, but the game does already have the concept of players stating their intent and the GM adjudicating results based on that. Not hard to say "okay on a critical success player narrates results" or something similar.<br/>* Talislanta's never been about "game balance" and in 4th edition characters are definitely powerful in their areas of expertise.<br/>* As mentioned, see the 4th edition magic system, plus the two supplements for weirder and more powerful stuff.<br/>* The Action Table system, again: d20 + skill, 1-5 failure, 6-10 partial success, 11-19 full success, 20+ critical. That's all there is to it.<br/>* This also may or may not be missing. The system is minimal to begin with. If coming up with your own unique skills and special abilities counts as the system lending itself to flavor, then you're all set. If you had something more detailed in mind, perhaps not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365700/#Comment_365700" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T12:21:31+00:00" title="March  7, 2012 12:21PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Hi, y'all! Been a while....)<br/><br/>At the risk of not being "indie," what about Fantasy Hero (Hero System)?<br/><b>* Something faster that 4th Ed D&amp;D. Something mechanically elegant</b><br/>If you restrict Speed, Multipowers, and Variable [anything], Hero is very fast. It is elegant if one wants some crunch (maneuvers, special attack types) without getting mired in charts and graphs and modifiers and resolutions (I'm looking at YOU, Burning Wheel).<br/><br/><b>* Some kind of player narrative control (Fate pts w/ Aspects, Artha in BW etc).</b><br/>I'm surprised that more folks don't recognize that about half of the Disadvantages are player agency in world creation. Maybe because (old-skool, trad) GMs can't stand having players make their own enemies (no, this isn't Lumpley-Principle-violating, as the GM still generates the type of adversity resulting from Hunted, etc.).<br/>And don't get me started on creative use of Transform.... <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/><br/><br/><b>* Powerful player characters</b><br/>250 Base pts + 100 Disad pts and you'll be JUST fine on that! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>(Especially without folks dumping a shit-ton of points into Speed arms races.)<br/><br/><b>* Cool, weird, evocative magic</b><br/>I can't think of a system more-suited to creativity and style, for "magic" (or whatever you decide to flavor it: faith, sorcery, psi). If you ignore my advice on bullet 1, and let in Multipowers and Variable Power Pools, you got "Mage-like" magic, too. (Elemental pools are good, too, for something more like Last-Airbender-style magic).<br/><br/><b>* Easy to run</b><br/>Define "easy." And "run." <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><b>* System lends itself to flavor</b><br/>I'd say that the Advantages and Limitations bits of the system reek of flavor (i.e., Color), but it's only as stinky as you make it. It doesn't have "baked-in Color" like Mouse Guard or DitV; but it gives you every tool for which you could ask, to shape Setting (not only through "special effect" Color but also with Active Cost Limits and similar, to let you relatively scale various effect types or abilities).<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Damn... did I just explain Hero System to Storn...? O_o<br/>:P<br/><br/>Anyway... use Hero and take time to actually fill out a COMPLETE Campaign Rules Sheet (or whatever it's called this edition: the thing that lets you set Power Level, ACLs for specific powers, and/or forbid specific powers). And I'd say go with Heroic settings, unless you don't want to fool with equipment and stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365723/#Comment_365723" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T13:33:05+00:00" title="March  7, 2012  1:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2012 1:35PM by Wordman.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Storn</cite>All three of them were interested in roleplaying more.

I think it really hits a niche that is missing.  A good, robust, elegant system designed to emulate jrpgs.  Awesome!!!<br/><br/>Update:  I had a conversation yesterday with two of the players, Steve and Yamilla.  Steve Ellis is one of the artists and is really a great illustrator, and a longtime rpg-er, his wife Yamilla has roleplayed a bit, but isn't super experienced.  She said that she has only "this much brain" (holding her finger and thumb apart)  for absorbing tons of infodump (my word) of history, culture and conflict that seems to drape over many fantasy settings.  She said that she could totally get stuff in play as the game burbled along.  To which I trotted out my idea of all of us doing the map together and how much control SHE would have for HER character.  Because then after the map idea, we would do group character generation building on what we all just put down on the map.  She and Steve were <b>THRILLED</b> with the idea!<br/><br/>Then she was like; "I have tough time playing alignment and if I god is this, that or whatever and how it relates to my character".  To which I responded, "if your character is a priest or cleric, YOU defined what YOUR god(s) is like."  Queue the happy dance (Yamilla was literally squirming with joy on the sofa at the coffee shop).  I then on to explain a bit about the LoA group character generation and how they will guest-star in each other's "novels, modules, comics".  How that builds group unity and how then the game is really skewed towards what the players are interested in and how much their character generation impacts the world creation.  They were really into it.  <br/><br/>Then I quickly sketched out the group map idea to Camillo (our graphic designer and budding amateur illustrator) and he wrote back in bold "Sounds Perfect!" large text.  <br/><br/>So I am glad that my ideas are being accepted.  And it is nice to play with folks who haven't been exposed to every indie arrow in the indie quiver and start to see them pull back the bow.  <br/><br/><br/>--and David, yeah.  I know all too well the Hero system.  I ran Fantasy Hero many, many times.  I just feel that Hero, as brilliant as it is in some places and for its time REALLY IMPORTANT in game design... it is just outdated now.  There is no player authorship currency (yes, I could hack it in), Strength is waaay too cheap (yes, I could raise its cost).  Too much book-keeping for folks who are interested in roleplaying not rollplaying.  Magic is very mechanical.  yeah, not the right hammer for this nail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
