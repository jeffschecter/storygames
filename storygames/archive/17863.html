At the end of each session, if you\u2019ve impacted a place and moved on, mark XP. <br/><br/><b>Alignments</b>: <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good</span>: Put yourself in danger to protect the innocent <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chaotic</span>: Shoot first and ask questions later when you probably shouldn\u2019t<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lawful</span>: Do something based on your principles even if it\u2019s not in your best interests<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neutral</span>: Defeat a worthy opponent<br/><br/><b>Starting Moves</b>: <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gunsmith</span>: You know the lost arts of gunsmithing, passed between the lonesome ranks of the gunslingers. Whenever you have some scrap metal and some time to work on your craft, you can make bullets and repair your firearm should it need to be repaired. Bullets cost 1 coin in material, have 4 ammo, and 1 weight. You start with one firearm: <br/>\u2022\tA shining revolver. Close, near, 1 piercing, 1 weight. <br/>\u2022\tA brutal, much-repaired blunderbuss. Close, reach, 1 piercing, +1 damage, messy, reload, 3 weight. <br/>\u2022\tA worn but well maintained musket. Near, far, 1 piercing, 2 weight. <br/><br/>When you fight with a weapon other than a gun, your damage dice drops to a d8. Also, when you roll snake eyes (2), your gun jams, and you cannot use it until you spend some time clearing it. Pistols and blunderbusses can be used to hack and slash, but with +DEX instead of +STR.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gunslinger\u2019s Grace</span>: While you aren\u2019t wearing armor, gain your DEX in armor. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grit</span>: A gunslinger is known not just for their skill with firearms, but for their grim determination to do whatever it takes to accomplish whatever they want done. This determination is represented by grit.<br/><br/>When you draw your gun for the first time in an engagement, roll +WIS: <br/>On a 10+ gain 3 grit. <br/>On a 7-9, gain 1 grit. <br/>On a miss, you don\u2019t manage the draw fast enough \u2013 everyone else present gets the chance to do something before you\u2019re ready to start shooting. <br/><br/>You also gain 1 grit whenever you drop someone to 0 HP with a gun or whenever you roll boxcars (12) on any move involving firing your gun. Lose all grit when you put away your weapons.<br/><br/><i>Choose two deeds to use your grit with</i>: <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Smooth Shooting</span>: As long as you have one grit, your gun never jams. <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Take Cover</span>: As long as you have something nearby to use as cover, you can spend 1 grit to negate damage dealt to you equal to your level.  <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trick Shot</span>: You may spend 1 grit to pull off a normally impossible shot such as at a target who\u2019s too far, behind cover, to shoot something out of someone\u2019s hand, or the like. <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gritty Resolve</span>: You may spend 1 grit for +1 forward to defy danger or discern realities. <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bullet Between the Eyes</span>: You may spend 1 grit to ignore the armor of someone for a single attack. <br/><br/><b>Starting Gear</b>: <br/>You start with dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight), your firearm, and bullets (4 ammo, 1 weight) <br/>Also, choose one: <br/>Adventuring gear (1 weight) and 20 coins <br/>or Extra Bullets (4 ammo, 1 weight), 50 coins, and a price on your head<br/><br/><br/><b>Advanced Moves</b>: At each level from 2-5, choose one of these moves.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multiclass Wanderer</span>: Choose a move from the ranger, fighter, or thief class. You cannot choose multiclass moves from those classes. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Han Shot First</span>: When you roll to shoot someone before they\u2019ve attacked you, take +1 to that roll. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fire Into the Air Whilst Shouting</span>: When you fire your guns into the air and shout a lot, roll +CHA. On a 10+, your enemies are frightened or distracted, and must change their current course of action immediately. On a 7-9, the same happens but they focus their attention solely on you or you expend 1 ammo from the constant firing, at the GM\u2019s choice. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Never Bring a Knife to a Gun Fight</span>: You get +1 armor against melee weapons. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I count six shots." \u201cI count two guns.\u201d</span>: You forge yourself a second revolver. Deal +1d4 to damage when you wield both at once. If you chose a musket or blunderbuss instead just take +1d4 damage all the time when using your chosen firearm.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Go Ahead, Make My Day</span>: When you hit someone who has just damaged one of your allies (other than you), take +1d4 damage. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Man of Many Deeds</span>: Choose an extra deed. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">By the Skin of Your Teeth</span>: You may negate all damage from an attack, at the cost of all your remaining grit. You must have at least one grit to use this ability. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One Last Shot</span>: When you make a last breath roll, you may deal your damage against any foe. <br/><br/><br/>At each level from 6-10, choose one of these moves or a level 2-5 move: <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multiclass Master</span>: Choose a move from the ranger, fighter, or thief class. You cannot choose multiclass moves from those classes.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extreme Firepower</span>: (replaces I count two guns) You deal +1d8 damage when you wield two guns or your musket or blunderbuss. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legendary Deeds</span>: (requires man of many deeds) You gain all the remaining deeds. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Are you feeling Lucky, Punk?</span>: The first time you attack after running out of ammo, roll a single d6. On a 1-2, you\u2019re actually out of ammo. On a 3-6, you may deal your maximum damage without rolling to hit or for damage. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guns are the Future</span>: (replaces never bring a knife to a gunfight) You get +2 armor against melee weapons and +1 armor against magical attacks, even ones that ignore armor. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deadly Eye</span>: When you discern realities you may also ask \u201cwhat is this thing or being\u2019s greatest weakness?\u201d for free. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Man With No Name</span>: Your legend precedes you, and follows in your wake as you become one of the mysterious gunslingers of legend. You may parley with WIS instead of CHA and whenever you meet someone, the GM will tell you what they\u2019ve heard of your accomplishments (which may not actually be <i>your</i> accomplishments). <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peerless Shooting</span>: When you volley or hack and slash with a gun, on a 12+, choose an aspect of them (a body part, an item they\u2019re holding, their confidence, etc.). They lose it. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404478/#Comment_404478" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T20:55:34+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  8:55PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2013 9:03PM by whiteknife.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also did some Prestige Classes converted over from Pathfinder. These work a little differently than Compendium Classes. <br/><br/><b>How Prestige Classes Work</b>: When you meet the conditions you may make a petition move for a prestige class, assuming you\u2019re able to do what it specifies. If you succeed, you may enter the class when you next level up, gaining access to its moves and losing access to the moves of your old class (although retaining the ones you\u2019ve chosen so far). If you miss, your petition fails and you level up normally, although you may try to petition again at a later level if you meet the conditions for the petition again. If you obtain a result of 7-9 and do not want to go through with the petition you may, although you must meet the conditions and roll again should you want to repeat the petition at a later level. If a class has multiple petition moves, you need only (and may only) make one per level up. However, should you fail or choose not to make the petition, you can use either one should you choose to petition again in the future.<br/><br/><b>Master Chronicler</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Petition Move</span>: When you write a book about your adventures and distribute it, roll +INT, +WIS, or +CHA. On a 10+, the book is well-received and you may enter the class. You also make some money: 50x your level coins. On a 7-9, as above but choose one: <br/>\u2022\tYour book has angered some group for their depiction within it.<br/>\u2022\tYour book revealed some weaknesses of your group that future enemies might exploit. <br/>\u2022\tYou had to go through difficult distribution, costing you 50x your level in coins instead of making you money. <br/>On a miss, your book wasn\u2019t well received at all.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consult the Chronicles</span>: When you consult the chronicles of past heroes about a subject that took place long ago, roll +INT. On a 10+ you find the information you\u2019re looking for. On a 7-9, you find the information but it\u2019s incomplete, vague, or finding it drew unwanted attention (GM\u2019s choice). <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deep Pockets</span>: Add half your level (rounded up) to the number of uses of adventuring gear and bags of books you carry. Your max load also increases by 2. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Will Make an Epic Tale</span>: You may negate the damage from any one hit. If you do, you take -1 ongoing until you spend some time to write down the story of what happened. You may not use this ability if you\u2019re already suffering -1 ongoing from a past use. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Master of Maps</span>: You have studied countless maps and know of many lands you have never set foot upon. When you act as trailblazer on a perilous journey, you get +2 to your roll. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Companion to Heroes</span>: When you aid someone, they also take +1 on the next roll they make after the one you aided them on.  <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br/>Smear Campaign</span>: When you start a rumor to discredit someone or outright decry them in public, roll +CHA. On a 10+ public sentiment turns against them and their reputation takes a major blow. On a 7-9, their reputation is only harmed, not ruined or they know that you were the source of the rumors, at the GM\u2019s choice. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multiclass Initiate</span>: You may take a move from another class as though you were one level lower. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spreading the Legend</span>: When you tell great stories of the party\u2019s adventures and exploits you may add your CHA to carouse rolls (in addition to any coin spent)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Good Read</span>: (Level 6+) You may take some time (from a few hours to a few days) to write an entertaining tale or account and imbue into it some of the spirit of adventurousness and ingenuity. The first one who reads it gets +2 forward. You may only have one such story imbued in this way at a time.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summon Heroes Past</span>: (Level 6+)When you summon the spirits of past heroes, roll +WIS. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one. <br/>\u2022\tThey help your party in the current situation, giving you and your allies +1 ongoing until their current task is finished. <br/>\u2022\tThey intimidate, frighten, or dismay your enemies<br/>\u2022\tThey don\u2019t demand a great tribute before being called again. <br/>On a miss, they don\u2019t show up and they demand a great tribute before you attempt to call them again. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404479/#Comment_404479" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T20:55:55+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  8:55PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><br/>Swashbuckler</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Petition Move</span>: When you challenge someone to a one-on-one duel over a matter of honor or morals, roll +CHA. On a 10+, they accept your challenge gracefully at the time and location of their choosing. On a 7-9, they accept your challenge but the GM chooses one: <br/>\u2022\tThe time and place are of their choosing. <br/>\u2022\tThey are only pretending to be graceful, and will attempt to cheat should things turn against them. <br/>\u2022\tThey decline your offer, but in doing so accidentally reveal something they\u2019d rather have kept hidden. (If this option is chosen, you may make the petition move again this level). <br/>On a miss, the GM chooses two of the above. In any case, you gain access to the class if you win the duel, and must petition again if you lose the duel or if you cheat before they do (by making the duel not one-on-one or by breaking any other agreed upon terms). <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Riposte</span>: When you wield a precise weapon, wear non-clumsy armor (even if you can ignore the clumsy tag), and do not wear a shield, you get +1d6 damage forward whenever you take damage from a foe in melee. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Impressive Heroics</span>: You get +1 to defy danger rolls made during combat or made to save another from harm. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cunning Socialite</span>: When you carouse, on a 12+, you may choose three and one of those three will be especially useful (you may not choose to be especially not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked). <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rapier Wit</span>: When you distract your foe with witty banter or insults while fighting them roll +CHA. On a 10+, as long as you continue to distract them all damage against them is rolled twice and the best result is used. On a 7-9, you distract them as above but their rage gives them +1d4 damage ongoing against you while you distract them. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Duelist\u2019s Challenge</span>: When you challenge a foe to a one on one duel, they must attack no one but you and you must attack no one but then. If they decline the challenge or cheat and attack another, all rolls made against them are at +1 ongoing for the remainder of the battle. If you break the challenge, you get -1 ongoing for the remainder of the battle. If others involve themselves in your duel, the duel is off and either party may act as they like \u2013 however, directly asking an ally to attack your opponent counts as breaking the terms of the challenge, and subjects the asker to the penalties described above. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Graceful Swordsmanship</span>: When you wield a precise weapon, wear non-clumsy armor (even if you can ignore the clumsy tag), and do not wear a shield, you get +1 armor. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am not Left Handed</span>: When you fight with a handicap, take -1 ongoing to hack and slash until you reveal your handicap. When you reveal your handicap and fight properly after missing a roll or taking damage in a fight, take +1 ongoing to hack and slash until the fight is over. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">En Garde</span>: When you give your opponents proper warning and allow them to prepare themselves so as to make the fight fair, take +1 forward against them. If they exploit your honor and use unfair tactics, take +1d4 damage forward and +1 armor forward as well. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carve Your Mark</span>: (Level 6+) When you cut your mark into a defeated foe instead of killing them, you may ask them one question and they must answer it truthfully to the best of their knowledge. If that person is then killed by your allies without further provocation you take -1 ongoing from dishonor until you take your mind off it by carousing. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legendary Exploits</span>: (Level 6+) At the end of any session, if you participated in events that would make a great tale of daring do, adventure, and cunning mark experience. If this is in dispute, tell a short vignette from what such a story might be like. <br/><br/><b>Shadowdancer</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Petition Move</span>: When you dance in a place where sunlight has never shone to appease the shadows themselves, roll +DEX or +CHA. On a 10+ the shadows are pleased and you gain access to the class, and the shadows grant you a boon: once, you may call to them with a question and they will answer as best they can. On a 7-9, the shadows give you access to the class, but the dance has drawn the attention of dark forces who want to either recruit you to their sinister purposes or slay you. On a miss, the shadows find your dance displeasing and leaves you barely coherent, inflicting all the debilities upon you and leaving you with 1 HP. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hide in Plain Sight</span>: When you hide behind the shadows themselves, roll +DEX. On a 10+, as long as you stay within a short distance of darkness or shadow, no one can see you. On a 7-9, choose one: <br/>\u2022\tYou\u2019re only partially obscured, effectively giving you +1 armor ongoing while you remain near to darkness. <br/>\u2022\tYou\u2019re totally hidden for now, but are exposed as soon as you attack or make some other action that affects another in a non-subtle way. <br/>\u2022\tYou put yourself in a spot even while hidden. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Danger is my Dance Partner</span>: Whenever you defy danger, take +1 forward unless you miss, in which case you take -1 forward in addition to suffering the danger. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shadow Puppetry</span>: When you shape the shadows into an illusory image of roughly human size, roll +CHA. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one: <br/>\u2022\tYour illusion can depict as many things as would fit in a 20\u2019x20\u2019 room. <br/>\u2022\tYour illusion covers all five senses, not just sight. <br/>\u2022\tYour illusion will not vanish if it moves outside of an area of darkness or shadow.  <br/>You may only have one illusion around at a time made with this ability. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eyes of the Eclipse</span>: You can see perfectly through any darkness, and get +1 on all discern realities rolls made in an area of complete darkness. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me and My Shadow</span>: When you take this move, your shadow splits off from you and becomes alive. It cannot speak, but understands you and can convey emotional responses such as fear or a sense of danger. It cannot affect the physical world, although this makes it nearly immune to harm, except perhaps through powerful light magic. It is not truly incorporeal, although its thin size allows it to slip through even the tiniest cracks. Most Shadowdancers make use of this ability to spy on foes and serve as a scout. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acquainted With the Night</span>: While you stand in darkness or shadow, you get +1 armor. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choreographed Escape</span>: You may negate all damage from a single hit by vanishing into the shadow. When you return to the world from the embrace of shadows, roll +DEX. On a 10+, you return right away and without problems. On a 7-9, choose one: <br/>\u2022\tThe way back was long \u2013 you cannot return for 1d4 hours. <br/>\u2022\tYou got lost along the way \u2013 you return to the normal world somewhat near where you left, but elsewhere, and always close to some danger. <br/>\u2022\tYou brought something with you \u2013 something bad returned from the world of shadows and is now near to you\u2026<br/>On a miss, the GM chooses two. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dance Through Darkness</span>: (Level 6+) You can teleport through the shadows themselves. Roll to return to the world from the embrace of shadows as for choreographed escape, but your default return destination is any dark area within 30 feet per level of your initial entry point. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">May Darkness Consume You</span>: (Level 6+) When you curse someone to be consumed by darkness, roll +CHA. On a 10+, actions against them take +1 ongoing until they stand under the noonday sun. On a 7-9, either as above but you suffer the same penalty or the bonus is merely +1 forward. On a miss, you suffer the penalty but your foe does not. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weave Shadow</span>: (Level 6+) When you weave shadow into solid non-magical objects, roll +INT. On a 10+, you may create 5 weight of objects. On a 7-9 you may create 2 weight of objects. The objects last until exposed to light, at which point they rapidly dissolve into shadow.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404480/#Comment_404480" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T20:57:19+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  8:57PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Dragon Ascendant</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Petition Move</span>: When you devour the flesh of a dragon, roll +CON. On a 10+, it strengthens you, allowing you access to the class and removing all damage, debilities, and lasting injuries or curses you may be suffering from. On a 7-9, you gain access to the class, but the flesh disagreed with you. You either gain a weakness to the element the dragon breathed (taking 1.5x damage from it) or you are weakened and lose 1 point of CON permanently. If you become weak to the element, you cannot become immune to it later via blood of dragons. If you miss, all you get is a strangely tasty meal. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Petition Move</span>: When you beg a non-hostile dragon to teach you its ways, roll +CHA. On a 10+ it takes a liking to you, allowing access to the class, and it gives you a piece of its horde as a memento, worth 100 coins per level. On a 7-9, you gain access but (GM\u2019s choice), <br/>\u2022\tIt demands tribute of 100 coins times your level.<br/>\u2022\tDuring its mentoring, it grows to dislike you, and is now your enemy. <br/>\u2022\tIt wishes you to first eliminate one of its foes. <br/>If you miss, it denies your request and insistence will likely not be taken kindly\u2026<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scales Like Shields</span>: Your armor increases by 1 due to armored scales growing on your body.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teeth like Swords, Claws like Spears</span>: You can grow and retract vicious claws and wicked fangs. While extended, they count as a weapon: hand, 2 piercing, messy. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draconic Might</span>: Increase your Strength and Constitution by 1 (to the normal max of 18). <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draconic Splendor</span>: Increase your Intelligence and Charisma by 1 (to the normal max of 18).<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blood of Dragons</span>: Choose an element breathed by dragons (flame, cold, acid, lightning, poison, etc.). Your blood flows with the power of that element and you become immune to it. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dragon Magic</span>: Choose a single wizard spell of your level minus one or less. You can cast it using the wizard\u2019s cast a spell move. Each morning, when you awaken after a night\u2019s rest, the spell is automatically prepared again.  You can change the spell you\u2019ve chosen only by drinking a small vial of dragon blood or by being instructed directly by a dragon. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Senses of the Wyrm</span>: Your senses sharpen and hone. When you discern realities you may also ask \u201cWhat here is hidden from me?\u201d for free in addition to your other questions (even if you miss).<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breath of the Dragon</span>: (Level 6+) When you exhale elemental energy (of a type chosen when you take this move), roll +CON. On a 10+, deal your damage +1d8 in a cone or line out from you. On a 7-9, as 10+, but you also exhaust your breath until you rest, suffer backlash from the energies you channel, taking 1d8 damage (even if you\u2019re immune to the element of your breath), or catch something you would rather not in the blast. On a miss, the GM chooses two of the above. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dragon Wings</span>: (Level 6+) You may grow or retract massive dragon wings at will. These wings allow you to fly (but not hover in one spot), assuming you have enough room. While airborne, you take -1 ongoing. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draconic Ascension</span>: (Requires at least three other dragon ascendant moves, Level 6+) You learn the ascendant\u2019s ultimate secret: how to transform into a full-fledged dragon. When you turn into a dragon, roll +STR, CON, INT, or CHA. On a 12+, gain 4 hold. On a 10+, gain 3 hold. On a 7-9, gain 2 hold. While a dragon, your gear merges with you and you may use any of your normal abilities. You may also spend hold 1 for 1 to do the following things. When you run out of hold, you return to normal and cannot transform again until you rest.  <br/>\u2022\tBreath elemental energy (as breath of the dragon, above, but doing +1d12 instead of +1d8)<br/>\u2022\tTake to the skies, allowing you to fly (as dragon wings but without the -1 ongoing penalty) <br/>\u2022\tNegate a hit against you with your armored scales <br/>\u2022\tStrike with fearsome strength, rolling your normal damage twice and taking the better result, with an extra 2 piercing.<br/>\u2022\tBend the element you breathe to your will, shaping it as you see fit. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404481/#Comment_404481" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T20:58:45+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  8:58PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Bitten</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Petition Move</span>: When you\u2019re bitten by a vampire but struggle to control the curse, roll +CON or CHA. On a 10+, you are only partially taken by the vampire\u2019s curse, and gain access to the class. Also, you gain a link to the vampire who bit you, and you always know their location and general mood. On a 7-9, you resist most of the curse and gain access to the class, but the GM chooses one: the one who bit you gains a measure of control over you, and you must obey simple non-dangerous requests from them or the bite greatly weakens your body or spirit, permanently lowering your constitution or charisma by 1 (your choice). On a miss, you fail to control the curse and fall into a deep slumber from which you can only be awaken by being bathed in sunlight for a number of hours equal to your level. <br/><br/><i>Automatic Moves</i>: When you enter the class, you automatically gain the \u201cShunned by the Sacred\u201d move and one extra move of your choice in addition to the normal move obtained from leveling up. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shunned by the Sacred</span>: You take -1 ongoing while under direct sunlight, in the presence of a good-aligned deity\u2019s holy symbol, or in the presence of garlic <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Undying Body</span>: You get +6 HP as most of your body dies off, making you mostly sustained through unholy energies. However, death\u2019s call is more tangible to you, and you take -1 to all last breath rolls. <br/><br/>Cursed Might: Weapons you wield gain the forceful and messy tags. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mesmerizing Gaze</span>: When you look into a humanoid creature\u2019s eyes and command it to do tasks that aren\u2019t obviously dangerous, roll +CHA. On a 10+ they\u2019ll follow your commands until you cease to command it for a few minutes. On a 7-9, choose one: <br/>\u2022\tThey attempt to subvert the intent of your commands<br/>\u2022\tThey only follow your commands for a few seconds<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br/>Embrace the Light</span>: (Replaces Shunned by the Sacred) Whenever you\u2019re exposed to direct sunlight, a good aligned holy symbol, or garlic, take -1 forward. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taste the Crimson Wine</span>: <br/>*When you drink the blood of someone who\u2019s struggling to resist, roll +STR. On a 10+, deal your damage (not modified by your weapon) and heal half that much damage. On a 7-9, let them slip through your grasp but avoid a counter attack or push the issue and take their damage, but deal your damage (not modified by your weapon) and heal half that much damage. Your bite is acts as a hand range weapon. <br/>*When you drink the blood of someone who\u2019s not resisting, deal them any amount of damage and heal that much. <br/>*When you drink a corpse dry, heal equal to one quarter of its max HP rounded up. <br/>*When you go for a full night without drinking blood, roll +CON. On a 10+, you\u2019re fine. On a 7-9, take -1 ongoing until you drink blood. On a miss, you attempt to drink the blood of the nearest living creature. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Call Night Dwellers</span>: When you summon rats, bats, and wolves to serve you, roll +CHA. On a 10+ lots of them arrive quickly. On a 7-9, there either aren\u2019t very many or they take a while to arrive. Once there, they attack any who you don\u2019t designate as your allies and then return to whence the came after their enemies are defeated. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eyes of the Predator</span>: You can see through any darkness and get +1 on discern realities rolls regarding beings with blood.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unnatural Celerity</span>: You can move with incredible speed, giving you +1 to defy danger by getting out of the way or acting fast, and allowing you to run twice as fast as a normal member of your race.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trance of Bloodlust</span>: (Replaces Mesmerizing Gaze, Level 6+) As mesmerizing gaze, but you may make your target engage in obviously dangerous activities so long as they aren\u2019t obviously suicidal. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Turn to Mist</span>: (Level 6+) When you turn into a cloud of mist, roll +CON. On a 10+, you can float slowly through the air under your control until you turn back. On a 7-9, you are carried along by subtle wind currents or you only turn to mist for a few seconds.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blood Connoisseur</span>: (Requires Taste the Crimson Wine, Level 6+) Whenever you drink blood from a source you\u2019ve never tried before (specific individuals count as different, whole new species aren\u2019t needed), heal +1d8 HP.
