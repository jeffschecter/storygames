Im a bit tired of and dystopia and space opera right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt should be something other than Shock and PTA, but only because Im dying to try something just a bit different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been reading John Barnes Thousand Cultures series and was just taken by the sense that the characters in the novel are trying to do good, while avoiding violence. Alan Dean Foster and Heinlein also have some interesting works where the general tone of the work is hopeful, while avoiding violence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis also brings up another point, question, thought... is violence necessary for a good RPG? So many of them have it and I can't help but wonder if it somehow influences how we perceive acts of horrible violence. I know, I know the military guy is speaking out against violence ... but doesn't it seem like games put a lot of stock in pain?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow thats a divergence and if people comment on that more I'll split it off into something.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I was inspired by a Japanese game called <a href="http://j-rpg.com/talk/comments.php?DiscussionID=8" rel="nofollow">Yuuyake Koyake</a>, where you play an animal with the power to take human form in a town in rural Japan, and you help people and make friends. AotSP is meant to be kind of like that, but with some B-movie sci-fi tropes thrown in. I'm using kind of a "junior" variant of Spirit of the Century, though I think I'm going to have to play with the conflict rules some. The violent approach will be possible, but not at all optimum. I'm making a quick scenario generator using playing cards, and violence won't really help if Time Agent Tina is accidentally preventing Timmy from getting his homework done.<br><br>In general, I think that RPGs don't have to be violent at all, but there usually needs to be come kind of conflict or something.  Yuuyake Koyake is totally nonviolent, but you do deal with people who have problems, so there are conflicts to resolve, and occasionally between PCs. I've also been working on a game called "<a href="http://yarukizero.wordpress.com/2008/01/21/raspberry-heaven-02-playtest-1/" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Heaven</a>," based on slice-of-life anime and manga, which is not only non-violent but largely conflict-free. It's about as non-traditional as you get, a sort of storytelling exercise with playing cards involved rather than an RPG in a conventional sense.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151793/#Comment_151793" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T04:25:12+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  4:25AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2008 4:25AM by Graham.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, you think Galactic is Firefly?

I don't think either is necessary for a good game. I mean, I'm sure any of us could make a list of excellent games that don't center around violence. I think violence is an easy sell.

Look at the tales that last, from Beowulf, the Greek tragedies and so on.  Violence matters to us, because violence is where human beings stake, ultimately, what we're really willing to put on the line.  We use stories -- and games with conflict -- to negotiate with ourselves and with society as a whole where we think we're going to draw those lines.<br/><br/><i>However</i>, I think a lot of games (especially in the past) said, "Okay... so, we have a way of fighting, and a setting, and some other stuff. We're all set."  <br/><br/>Which is a way of saying that the ways the Players could interact with each other were pretty limited to fighting.<br/><br/>Look at <i>Primetime Adventures</i> as a new and different kind of game in this regard.  There <i>might</i> be fights.  But the interactions between players is about who's going to control the narrative, not whether or not the .45 is going to pierce someone's chest.  If the Players want the game to not revolve around violence, then they can make that happen!  By getting control of the narrative.<br/><br/>I would, in fact, suggest you look at <i>Primetime Adventures</i> for the game your searching for right now.  No, it's not a game with specific SF color.  But you and your fellow players will control the color to your hearts' desire.  And, again, what the players do with each other at the table (wrangling the narrative) will let you all determine whatever you want to be the circumstances, conflict and resolution -- using whatever qualities of human behavior you want. [Edit: oops... I just noticed you didn't want PtA...  Sorry about that.]<br/><br/>Other games you might want to look at along these lines are <i>The Pool</i> and <i>Universalis</i>.  <br/><br/>Another angle would be to use rules where the resolution mechanics still go action by action like more traditional games, but are abstracted enough to plug in any actions you want.  For example, <i>HeroQuest</i> (the rules, not the Glorantha setting).  Since a character sheet in HeroQuest is just a compilation of characteristics that the Players (as a group and as individuals) care about and want play to be about, it might work out really well for you guys.<br/><br/>Given that these games don't have settings, you might consider using the setting building rules from <i>Universalis</i> or <i>Shock: </i> to construct the game's environment, no matter what game you end up playing.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151832/#Comment_151832" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T08:34:21+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  8:34AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to Justin for doing my advertising for me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>You may indeed want to check out <a href="http://suffadv.wikidot.com" rel="nofollow">SA</a>.

Even re-suggesting Shock and PTA is pretty great, I gonna see if I can get just a little blood out of a stone before I move this thread on I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Sci-fi RPG background. The first sci-fi rpg I ever played was a homebrew gurps setting where the players and I had a ship which was bigger on the inside than the outside, and we travelled from world to world just exploring. The focus on discovering stuff I think was the influence of my gamemaster who was really secretly taken with Traveller, but unable to get us to learn and play the system. This might be because he'd exposed us to Shadowrun, GURPS, Robotech and Champions/Hero in the space of six months and we weren't up to learning just one more. (think the restaurant scene from Monty Pythons Meaning of life).Since then I've played Traveller, TNE, 2300AD, WEG Starwars and Metabarons, Jovian Chronicles, Heavy Gear, Hunter Planet, D20 Modern, Firefly, more Gurps, PTA, TWERPS, AEON (Trinity) Fading Suns, and Burning Empires. I own almost all of them too except Hunter Planet which is a shame cause thats all kinds of amazing. Traveller however is my second favorite sci-fi RPG after shock, because it makes combat so ugly that no one ever wanted to do it.<br/>\nShock ... wow what can I say about it, except man it gets sci-fi, science fantasy not as much, but sci-fi wow.<br/>\nI have and love HEAVY GEAR because of its setting but the system drives me crazy, because it handles violence soooo well and everything else becomes vanilla.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I see games like SIS and SA I get really excited because it tackles the subject of sci-fi from angles that I don't see in games and think I should. Im interested to take a look at bleakworlds too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152078/#Comment_152078" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T08:37:39+00:00" title="June 21, 2008  8:37AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could try playing Burning Empires* and stressing non-combat situations.

Such as MG Traveller, it is a great outgrowth of the original which we played mostly Merchants and such in back in the day. It is generic enough to let you make a setting easy enough (A friend of mine is doing that right now with lots of new aliens, etc, his own Republic).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is setting then why not do your own? Or ask here with like a list of wants in it and someone is likely to work on it for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo which or both or did I miss the systemboat totally here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152243/#Comment_152243" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T10:15:04+00:00" title="June 22, 2008 10:15AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "You could try playing Burning Empires* and stressing non-combat situations.

Now it's been played (or rather, played <em>with</em>), and at its core, it does what it's supposed to do. It needs to be much, much stronger before anyone starts seeing it out in the world. I'm not even sure what goes after the colon yet. "Alien Science Fiction"? "Exploratory Science Fiction"? Something like that, but less crap.</p>\n<p>Think of it as a science fiction National Geographic. The players are mostly specialists: a geologist, a biologist, an anthropologist, at the minimum. There can probably be a few more, non-specialists or specialists in non-obvious professions. In our game, we had a journalist. I can see there being maybe a hunter or an engineer along. It depends on what you're after, really.</p>\n<p>The deal is, the geologist draws maps, the biologist describes life forms, the anthropologist describes culture. You make scientific observations and take inferences \u2014 "Hey! I see some sort of large animal over there! It's got an exoskeleton! I infer from this that there is large life on this planet." Other people then might disagree. Say I don't want there to be large animals on the planet, only microbes. So I say, as the biologist, "No, the gravity's too high on this planet to support exoskeletal life that big." The other players vote with other observations, "As a physicist, I can tell you that gravity is inconsistent on this planet due to wildly varying densities of rock, " for instance. That support gives you dice, other earlier observations give you dice too, NPCs can be recruited to support you, and you roll. You take the biggest die on each side of the argument, and that player's right. The opposition then tears up the assertion they made, and the winning observation remains. Note that the inference doesn't get recorded. If an NPC is recruited into an argument and is wrong, they lose credit and become worth less in the next argument.</p>\n<p>The idea is, you create planets in a way that both allows everyone to contribute and surprises all the players, and in the process make something beautiful, textured, and interesting.</p>\n<p>That last part is important, because the output of the game is fully Shock: compatible. You can use it to create a planet, then use that planet in Shock: as Minuti\xe6 if you want to tell stories that use that rich environment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152798/#Comment_152798" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T19:34:31+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  7:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, I've got misspent youth... you gave me a copy at Nerdly, but its not really a positive game considering what the YO's morph into... but thanks for the suggestion, Joshua's Xenon is more like it. I ran a heavy gear game where all the players were members of an extreme Nature network called \xa1Nature! and all they did was hunt down and film (and try not to be killed by) exotic animals. Right now Im just on a positive anti-violence kick, Im sure it will pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nTADK<br/>\n<br/>\nIts both setting and system I think. If it were one or the other I think I could find something pretty quickly, but its the combo of thats really hammering me. Well that and 90% of all Sci-fi Rpg's want to either be Star Wars, Aliens or Dune. If the mechanics did that well I dont think Id hate it all that much, but for me they usually fall short. Oh well I have lots of stuff to work off of.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks you guys for some great suggestions, SIS, Xenon and Sufficiently Advanced really hit the itch I was looking for, but The others are definitely in my list of stuff to try.<br/>\nOh and I found another one that seems pretty good, Starchild the Velvet Generation for all you David Bowie Starman urges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
