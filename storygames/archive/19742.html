This is my global steampunk game that takes as its inspirations Firefly, Farscape, and Blake's 7.  The game delivers fast-paced, roguish action-adventure in a messy world of fantasy, history, and steam.  There's a lot of weird and (I think) wonderful stuff under the hood, which is why I'm trotting it out for beta playtest.  It works for me, I'd really like to make sure it works for anybody else.<br/><br/>The complete game is available for download here:<br/><br/><a href="http://rjbjplaytest.joshroby.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rjbjplaytest.joshroby.com</a><br/><br/>I'd love to hear your thoughts and play experiences, and I figured I'd put out a shingle here on story-games to catch questions and feedback.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>\u2014Josh                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438142/#Comment_438142" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-06T23:51:58+00:00" title="September  6, 2014 11:51PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2014 11:52PM by snej.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't reached the mechanics-y part of the book yet, but I'm impressed with the detail of the setting, especially its history and politics. Steampunk gets a frequently-deserved bad rap for reveling in colonialism, and I like the way you've turned that on its head here, as evidenced by this quote:\n<blockquote>When the Congress of London finally established a shaky cease-fire across Atlantis, the war-weary combatants turned around to find the rest of the world had risen to the status of rivals. Which hasn\u2019t gone over very well.<br/><br/>People understand there being a handful of movers and shakers: Great Powers, as those in Europe liked to style themselves. When Hyderabad and Co- manche and Siam and Zulu challenge Britain\u2019s naval dominance by taking to the skies, global politics becomes a wash of strange faces and unknown agenda. A tidal wave of Atlantean technology and applied sorcery has shaken and transformed daily living. The dirigible\u2019s burgeoning network of trade links has brought a glut of foreign cultures to every doorstep, along with alien manners and mores.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438143/#Comment_438143" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-07T00:11:29+00:00" title="September  7, 2014 12:11AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            pp.18-19: The terms "game master", "game master character" and "player character" probably ought to be moved to the "Game Terms Glossary".<br/>p.25: "there will be one player from your group will not portray a picaro" \u2014 the word "who" is missing after "group".<br/>p.25: Some of the bullet points end in periods and some don't; it feels inconsistent.<br/>p.29: Words for skin tones: You're missing two of my favorites, "alabaster" and "dusky". :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438147/#Comment_438147" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-07T06:10:02+00:00" title="September  7, 2014  6:10AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2014 6:11AM by James_Stuart.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd strongly strongly recommend a rules reference sheet: as far as I can tell, the rules for "how do I resolve a roll" are spread over 28 (35 if you count True Questions!) pages, and there's no shorter summary of them.

There's a whole world full of interesting people and histories and cultures, and there is absolutely no reason why those things shouldn't feature in a steampunk setting.<br/><br/>The interesting thing, though, is when I started digging into my research, I didn't really have to make much up.  There are a number of places that I'm sure readers will think are fabrications\u2014things like Comancheria, Haida Gwaii, Patagonia &amp; Araucania, Asanteman\u2026 the list goes on and on.  A lot of them look like "politically correct" revisions to history, allowing people of color to have slipped the noose of colonialism that they suffered in real history.  But these are all historical places, usually with strong and self-reliant cultures, that were still independent in the time period.<br/><br/>Part of this is the nature of maps, which are basically lies.  We grow up taking history classes that show the world carved up into various European Empires' holdings and protectorates, but what no one ever really explains is that the maps depict what the Euros <i>claimed,</i> which was often at direct odds with the political realities on the ground.  Hence the On Maps section in the book, and Cortin's maps that show, among other things, the Kulkadoon Free State and O\u010dh\xe9thi \u0160ak\xf3wi\u014b (AKA "The Great Sioux Nation").  People lived there, worked there, <i>governed</i> there, but they don't appear on history book maps.<br/><br/>I also don't think people realize how <i>really close</i> a lot of the colonial wars were\u2014and I don't think people realize how many colonial invasions were actually repelled.  That's one of the reasons I have the Sultanate of Aceh as one of the ports-of-call.  They fought off the First Expedition and lived free, albeit in the shadow of looming Dutch power, for years\u2014until the Second Expedition.  And it was usually things other than the fabulous technical innovation or clever tactics of the Europeans that decided the day.  North America fell to the US and Canada, more or less, due to smallpox\u2014and then the colonials swept in.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've rambled long enough (I could go on for days).  In all honesty, compiling the world map is probably the reason this game exists.  It took <i>so long</i> to dredge up what was happening across the world in the time period that, by the time I had a mostly-complete map, I had invested too much time to <i>not</i> finish the damned game. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/joshroby" title="joshroby"><img alt="joshroby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/joshroby">joshroby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438162/#Comment_438162" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-08T11:25:54+00:00" title="September  8, 2014 11:25AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, here are the Quick Reference pages: <a href="http://joshroby.com/downloads/RJBJ/RJBJ_Quick_Reference.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://joshroby.com/downloads/RJBJ/RJBJ_Quick_Reference.pdf</a><br/><br/>(They're also now in the playtest package.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438163/#Comment_438163" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-08T13:11:47+00:00" title="September  8, 2014  1:11PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah yeah, that's so much easier. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I should have assumed it was a mistake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438164/#Comment_438164" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-08T14:00:24+00:00" title="September  8, 2014  2:00PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went through the background section this weekend and I liked a lot of what I saw, buuuut: I'm just not a fan of the Confederacy surviving even in alt-history. You'll get no argument from me about the sins and failures of the North in not robustly defending Reconstruction and merely continuing White Supremacy (and eventually caving in to the remnants of the Slave Power.) And likewise you'll get no argument from me about the usefulness of Confederates as Bad Guys.<br/><br/>But you're talking about the continued misery of 4 million people and kind of sticks out in a world where a lot of the other sins of the nineteenth century get mitigated. <br/><br/>I love me an an anti-colonial Steampunk game!

The first outline of the book simply took that information and expanded it.  It was a complete oversight to not include them.<br/><br/>Aviatrix\u2014<br/><br/>I know, right?  I also have lots of complicated feels about the inclusion and portrayal of slavery.<br/><br/>I ended up doing a lot of reading, and I came to realize that I more-or-less couldn't extract slavery and retain anything resembling an alternate history.  Because it's not just CSA\u2014half or more of the states on the big world map allow slavery, including Comancheria, Empire of Brazil, and most of Africa.  There was also widespread slavery (although they didn't call it slavery) throughout Asia, including Russian serfs.  Not only that, but slavery made a large chunk of the global economy function.  In a lot of ways, globalization started in the 19th century, and it was through the slave trade.  Insofar as I was interested in looking at the beginnings of globalization (ie "global steampunk"), I needed to also look at slavery.<br/><br/>Where I ended up is, I hope, a good place, at least in terms for creating stories and engaging moments of characterization.  Slavery is an indelible element of the world, but that's because the world is seriously screwed up.  The major conceit for picaro characters is that you've fallen through the cracks of polite society and in so doing you see its many flaws, travesties, and skeleton-closets.  Slavery is one of many things that gets thrown into stark relief when you don't stay on the straight and narrow of where you're supposed to be.  You see the other side, and the conditions they live in, and you realize what's been happening your entire life.  I expect a recurring theme in picaro characters will be a disgust with and rejection of slavery.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if some campaigns ended up with crews of abolitionists knocking down slavers across the globe.<br/><br/>(Now I wax really idealistic; bear with me.)  There's also, with fantasy and science fiction, how your "strange" setting is always a distorted mirror of the world of the author and audience.  There's a part of me that holds out a stray hope that somebody might play or read the game and come to understand how slavery and other systems of oppression hide their true natures from the people who benefit from them.  Because slavery isn't something that used to happen\u2014it's alive and well throughout the world.  I couldn't do a <i>modern</i> setting without including, at least by implication, the slavery systems that still operate the sweat shops, marble quarries, and penitentiary labor that are an indelible part of today's global economy.<br/><br/>The Confederates can work rather well as bad guys, but I like to think their inclusion, along with the other slavers of the world, will do a little more than provide moustache-twirling baddies.  I hope they'll be a spur to thought, and perhaps even action. ( / idealism )<br/><br/>\u2026and after all that, if the Confederacy is a trigger for you and yours, the game is structured such that it's ridiculously easy to pop it right out.  In your game, the CSA could have lost a reignited civil war three months ago.  And you can go further: in the Empire of Brazil, Pedro II can have brought his abolitionist platform to the General Assembly in 1871 like in our timeline.  Comancheria may have abandoned slavery and began adopting escaped slaves, leading to a more robust society.  The jihadists sweeping across Northern Africa might have incorporated the abolition of slavery as one of its precepts.<br/><br/>I like to think that these are the sorts of things that the PCs might accomplish, and I wrote the book as I did based on that.  But my game is not your game, and the people around my table aren't the people around yours.  If it works better for you to make that tweak to the setting, more power to you.  JD Corley will be by shortly to remind us all that I can't stop you. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Does that make any sense, Aviatrix?

The second largest was the Confederate Army.<br/><br/>c) Atlantis triggers a new colonial scrabble; it seems more likely to me that the British would prefer the Union Navy to remain on blockade duty rather than interfere in their own operations. (Quarae: does the Monroe Doctrine apply to Atlantis? During the Civil War the USA was in no position to defend the Doctrine, but you better believe it was one of the reasons the French abandoned Maximillian after the war. That and Army surplus weapons shipped to the Mexicans.)<br/><br/>d) Ultimately, public recognition of the Confederacy would have been very difficult in England. Weavers went on strike to oppose the Confederacy, even during the cotton embargo that shut down looms all over England. (Besides, the British were already investing in Egyptian and Indian cotton, which would prove more useful after the war.)<br/><br/>--You're correct about the existence of slavery in other places (although it's about to be abolished in Brazil at this point in real history), especially in Africa--Zanzibar was the main slavetrading nation in the world. But I'm a bit confused that the way you want to integrate this recognition into your project of "taking a stance against colonialism" is to...negate the <i>single largest emancipation in history</i>.<br/><br/>--Finally, and this may just be my personal aesthetics: a unified Confederacy is not only done to death in alt-worlds, it's not even very likely. (Look up NC Governor Zebulon Vance sometime to see how "unified" the Confederacy really was.) If you want a balkanized North America, a balkanized Confederacy is not only more interesting, but it doesn't lump all the people oppressed by the CSA into a faceless bundle called "slaves." <br/><br/>I mean, where's the Free City of New Orleans, which shrugs off the planter aristocracy of the Deep South and re-establishes the creole society the Louisiana Purchase wiped out? Where's the Republic of Texas, trying to chart a third way between Commancheria and the East Texas cotton planters? Where's the Gullah freedom fighters of the Carolina coast, aided by Abolitionist soldiers-of-fortune and the Union blockade? The Chickasaw and escaped slaves of Jones' Confederacy in Alabama, or Jefferson Davis' plantation in Mississippi? (It was taken over by the freedmen--this is an actual thing that happened.)<br/><br/>Hell, for that matter, where are the Unionists of Appalachia? East Tennessee and western North Carolina were Unionist strongholds, so much so that they influenced Northern Strategy (Lincoln tried for four years to get an army into East Tennessee.)<br/><br/>I will note in passing that you can still have your Confederates and eat them too :-) To this day there are people in Brazil called "Confederacios" that are the descendants of Confederates who fled the former CSA and tried to re-establish a planter culture in Brazil, where they could still own slaves. You could have a CSA in exile there, or in Atlantis.<br/><br/>I'm not recommending any of these things, though; it's your world, not mine to meddle in. I respect the hell out of the research you did on Africa and South America. <br/><br/>You've done such an admirable job on the rest of the world that it just made the inclusion of the Confederacy stick out like a sore thumb for me, so I thought I'd give you some feedback on that; because I'm not the only one who's gonna have that reaction. (Check out the fairly-recent rpg.net threads on the Confederacy in Deadlands and the new Space: 1889.) The world looks really fun to play in--the CSA was just a very hard thing for me to swallow.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Aviatrix                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438195/#Comment_438195" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T09:19:20+00:00" title="September  9, 2014  9:19AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I too have a knee-jerk reaction to using the Confederacy in alt-historical games, partly because it is so very overexposed in the genre, but mainly because depending on where you live, its spirit is still very alive in our world (I see cars with Confederate flag decals almost daily).

Do you mind if I incorporate some of them?<br/><br/>The way the game works, with its picaresque globe-trotting and visits to specific, concrete ports-of-call, means that all of these things are absolutely possibilities for anyone's game at home, as well.  There is no nation-by-nation prose overview of the geopolitics (mostly because that would be another 400 pages), and the map is intended more as inspirational material than prescriptive constraints.  The world map is featured on the same page with a text bit saying <i>Don't trust maps</i> for this very reason.<br/><br/>As to your specific points, which are very informative and thank you for the food for thought, I don't want to seem defensive or combative, so please bear with:<br/><br/>a) Atlantis comes out of the sea in March of 1863.  This is after Ismail becomes Khedive of Egypt (because I wanted him running Egypt), and it's also after the Emancipation Proclamation.  But it's well before Gettysburg and more-or-less just in time to disrupt the Vicksburg campaign.  1863 is kind of the turning point year for the American Civil War, and I tried to plant the divergence point right before things started shifting.<br/><br/>b) In my head (and not yet anywhere on a page, admittedly), France and Britain ally with the Union and the Confederacy, respectively, for the fight over Atlantis, not for territorial disputes in North America.  In which case, tagging in the big boys is to both of their advantage.<br/><br/>c) Remember that Atlantis' rising wreaks some terrible tsunamis and destroys most North Atlantic ports; the Union Navy and its blockade are ripped to tatters by the rising.<br/><br/>(As to the Monroe Doctrine, I haven't put much thought there.  The Confederacy have taken Cuba and half of Hispaniola, and I suspect the Federation of Central America leans towards the Confederacy, diplomatically speaking.  Jamaica and British Honduras are still controlled by the UK, as well, so I don't think there's much Union presence in the Caribbean.)<br/><br/>d) The UK recognizing and allying with the CSA would <i>absolutely</i> create internal problems in the UK.  Internal problems means interesting places for picaros to visit/destabilize/wreak havoc in.  It also opens up the possibility of PCs interacting with abolitionists in Britain (and Canada, and Jamaica, and and and) trying to undercut their government's allies.  My goal in compiling the world map wasn't to create a stable status quo, it was to make a lot of teetering towers just waiting for picaros to come along and topple over.<br/><br/>-- Depending on how you consider the legalities, the single largest emancipation in history isn't wiped out, it still happens on January 1st, 1863.  The legal status of people within the rebel states is absolutely an open question.  The Emancipation Proclamation is one of the reasons I've got the Tanners active in the Sweetwater port-of-call.  To their minds, they're rescuing free men and women from rebels who are criminally keeping them enslaved.  And they're there for the PCs to encounter, perhaps assist, or perhaps mediate (as they're planning on killing all the whites in the Plantation).<br/><br/><b>All of which is to say</b> \u2014\xa0I don't think our positions are really that divergent.  The biggest difference, I think, is that the things that you want to see having already happened in the setting, I want to see happening at players' tables.<br/><br/>However, it seems like I need to do some more work underscoring that impulse so that it's clearer in the text.  With your permission, I think I'll add in the Free City of New Orleans (because I really like the sound of that).  I may also add some references to Gullah freedom fighters in the write-up of Thomas (p 256) who already speaks a little Gullah.  The Davis plantation sounds like a great possible port-of-call, too, and might include some references to how unstable the Confederacy's unity really is.<br/><br/>To reiterate once more, thanks so much for taking the time to think through and write out all this stuff.  I really appreciate it.<br/>\u2014Josh                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438210/#Comment_438210" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T12:16:40+00:00" title="September  9, 2014 12:16PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, March makes it slightly more likely, in that case the last major Union battle was the disaster at Fredericksburg and...maybe Stone River, I'd have to check.<br/><br/>However..."the emancipation still happens" is kinda weak sauce, man. Let me point out: <i>millions</i> of people ultimately benefited from the Union victory. We can talk about Reconstruction, I understand. But you're not just wiping out something good that was done by a government--you're tossing out the <i>liberation of people by themselves</i>. More than 150,000 African Americans fought in the Union Army. Many others helped the Union by acting as guides, or spies. Many helped sabotage the Confederate war effort. The Civil War wasn't just a bunch of white people fighting.<br/><br/>(Contrariwise, some of the tribes of the Indian Territory fought for the CSA. And the Union perpetuated a bunch of massacres against Native Americans during the war. History is rarely straightforward.)<br/><br/>Help yourself to the Free City--my girlfriend has New Orleans roots and talks a lot about the unique Creole multi-racial culture they had that got suppressed after the US took over. Keep in mind that severing the CSA's largest port from the rest of the Confederacy will have...consequences<br/><br/>More optional Civil War era stuff! Ignore at your leisure--I had Civil War for several years, although it's in remission.<br/><br/>The main issue with British/French intervention (besides my skepticism that even Gladstone could get a bill to third reading without a casus belli) was that France and Britain wouldn't act unless the other did as well--for the very good reason that they suspected one acting without the other would start a war between them. (Or Russia, Britain's shadow sparring partner, which was openly pro-Union.) France was marginally pro-Confederacy; the British upper classes were as well, but public opinion, after thirty years of proudly proclaiming Britain to be the world's leading anti-slavery power (overlooked, shall we say, in Egypt and Zanzibar) was solidly anti-CSA, or at least, "Why should we fight the bloody colonials again?"<br/><br/>My own head canon sees a Cuban revolution rather than a CSA takeover following the emergence of Atlantis; that was always kind of a fever dream and pretty impractical. Note that when the US had the chance to formally take over Cuba in 1898 that it declined. (De jure; de facto, it already had, via the United Fruit Company and others.)<br/><br/>I mean, I'll be honest: where does the CSA build the fleet to attack Hispaniola and Cuba? (OK...airships, duh. Still...) At this period, most of the world's warships were built by the British...or the United States. (There's a pretty cool story about Charles Francis Adams, as US Ambassador to Britain, working behind the scenes to keep a massive blue-water ironclad the Brits were building for the Confederates from ever getting launched; ultimately the British government bought it and it became their first major ironclad.)<br/><br/>In any case the British have possessions in the area, they will be...interested in that result. And what happened to the Spanish that they roll over so easily? I mean, they weren't much as Great Powers go for the period, but they still had <i>some</i> reach.<br/><br/>Don't take the Monroe Doctrine too seriously; the Brits never did. However, Lincoln was pretty serious about doing something about Maximilian in Mexico--the Red River expedition (another Union disaster!) was pretty clearly aimed at getting Union boots on the ground near the Texas border.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough; alt-history arguments never get anywhere :-) I'm glad you liked some of my ideas, and I'm still interested, even though we'll probably just have to disagree about including a Confederacy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438211/#Comment_438211" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T12:19:18+00:00" title="September  9, 2014 12:19PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the spirit of charity, I'll not touch upon the improbability of a union between Austria-Hungary and Germany.

"South Carolina: too small for a Republic, too large for an insane asylum."  as one newspaper put it.<br/><br/>I do want there to still be a Confederacy because shooting Confederate shitstains and spitting on their corpses is a really good thing for all Americans to fantasize about doing at every opportunity.  But maybe it's a smaller one, with the Mississippi River areas in Union hands (this was a done fuckin' deal by April 1862 when the mouth of the Mississippi got taken, none of this New Orleans free city nonsense, we got BEN BUTLER around, the guy who barracks-room-lawyered any slaves who crossed his lines into emancipation as early as 1861), the Deep South remaining defiant, poor and shitty, and West Virginia (which should be called Virginia) being kind of the redoubt of a central-North-American occupation zone extending through Virginia (which should be called Treason In Defense Of Slavery Virginia) and other border states. They could be in the midst of a forcible reconstruction by Union military, "radical" Republicans, local anti-Confederate partisans, abolitionists and freemen (and see W.E.B.
