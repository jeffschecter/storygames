I noticed that I'm more into making stories together than actually playing out roles. So my games aren't really roleplaying games per se, but storytelling games.<br/><br/>I think my own research in what engages us humans has made me realize new roads of where to take this medium, often with help of "soft" structures. Structures that rely on the interaction between the participants more than the interaction between the game rules and the participant.\ufeff</blockquote>\nI hate describing things by telling people what it's not, but it's hard to not do that. Using words as GM-less, dice-less and even roleplaying-less (or whatever) doesn't suit me.

So I thought playing pure storytelling games would be equally or more fun... but was surprised to see that, at least in many designs, a certain intensity is lost. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's a very different type of play. Less... personal.<br/><br/>When I GM, I can inhabit a character for a scene and play him or her to the hilt. I can find what makes your character tick and throws issues at her - perhaps even issues which are personally powerful for you, yourself. There's a whole interpersonal dynamic at the table which can be used to create drama.<br/><br/>In a pure storytelling game, it's much harder to design those kinds of interactions. (At least, I haven't seen one yet which does it.)<br/><br/>I think I would pitch "distant from characters"-style of play would be to keep impressing upon the players the joys of collaborative, open-ended creation, equal input, and a story which goes in completely unexpected directions. (Particularly if they're used to, say, an old-school, traditional RPG campaign which may be "on rails", heavily dependent on certain predictable trops - "You all meet in a tavern..." - or limits certain players' involvement, such as when your character is stuck in prison and you, the player, have to sit and wait for two hours while your friends figure out how to break you out.)<br/><br/>Constant engagement in play (in RPGs, you often have to "sit out" if you're not in the scene, or your character is dead, useless in that scenario, or sidelined in other ways) is another selling point, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439572/#Comment_439572" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-21T02:56:42+00:00" title="October 21, 2014  2:56AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is a really interesting conversation, because my experience has been that it's not necessary to explain this to a non-gamer. </blockquote>\nYes, exactly. It's just how someone will tell a story, if you ask them to tell a story with you. If you introduce the main character and then it's their turn, they will just start talking about what happens to the main character next. They might pause to seek approval/confirmation, especially if they do something unexpected, but there's no invisible line. Both behaviours are learned but obviously the one where you only have limited authority over a specific fictional entity that you must directly embody is the less common approach.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439573/#Comment_439573" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-21T03:20:42+00:00" title="October 21, 2014  3:20AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed.

A lot of people get really excited about the idea! I've never had anyone bring up questions or concerns aabout the character ownership issue - non-gamers don't even think about it, because they come into the game with no expectations, and RPG players, though more likely to find it awkward, usually know they're getting into something different right off the bat.<br/><br/>Non-gamers love it because they've never tried anything like it before (usually). Gamers enjoy the freedom, and some find it much more appealing than playing characters (especially if they've had bad experiences with railroading, being sidelined, having characters who couldn't contribute meaningfully to a game, or similar situations).<br/><br/>I think there's lots of rich, fertile ground for design here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439618/#Comment_439618" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-22T19:57:27+00:00" title="October 22, 2014  7:57PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2014 8:02PM by Paul88.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey I thought Tolkiens essay might open new ground? <br/><br/>Maybe you cant directly name this distance of play, so you might have to wrap it up in a story or intro to the game. <br/><br/>Tolkiens essay describes the very slippery nature of fairyland and the dangers for humans to go there.

We could be talking about <i>psychological</i> distance, in which you roleplay them but don't mind (or even find it amusing) if they die.  Keeping them in crosshairs, as DVB would say.  I've played wargames like "Squad Leader" this way and it's hysterical.  I want to play chess that way too, after reading that John Wick article.  But when I play that way I don't really care if my guys win, or even survive.  That's different from the way Players typically feel about their PCs, and understandably so.<br/><br/>Have you checked out <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19618/ornithopter-world-troupe-play-powered-by-the-apocalypse" rel="nofollow">Ornithopter World</a>?<br/><br/>Back to the question of the GM in a trad game.  Why is the GM such a weird thing?  Because it has to be.  It has its own teleology.  Some GMs are conscious about being artists.  That's an option, and in those cases there's nothing more that needs to be said.  Because Art.  The artist may evade simple reduction, but nevertheless (to my mind), the key <i>purpose</i> of the GM relative to the Players is to perform the functions of a reality-simulating machine that hasn't been built yet.<br/><br/>If it was possible to automate all GM functions, we would do it.  We're working on it all the time.  But we're superfar from done, so human functionaries must step in to fill the gap.<br/><br/>While GMing for live Players, we are processing requests, performing functions, maintaining system integrity and returning data in many formats (spoken, drawn, gestural, rhetorical, etc).  We are <i>performing.</i>  We are <i>performance machines.</i>  The dramatic sense of the word "performance" - while still a huge factor in the perceived quality of the experience - takes a back seat here to the technical sense.  We are fusing with a machine.  A good flow is more like driving a performance vehicle or playing a musical instrument than it is like acting (although performing in that second sense may also occur).<br/><br/>This is why on my view, when Players are present, the GM is not actually playing.  In IT lingo, the PC is a client, the GM is a server.  The GM is playing a <i>functional role,</i> but that role exists in a space which is epistemic to the fictional space the characters inhabit (into which roleplayers are encouraged and motivated to project and identify).  While we GMs may really enjoy this "removed" role and have (our definition of) fun doing it, we are still not <i>playing</i> in the sense that the Players are.  We are more immersed in the <i>system</i> as it runs and the story it produces than we are in the individual characters.  We are immersed in a different thing than they are, and we are neither projecting much of our consciousness into characters nor identifying much with them.<br/><br/>And that is why "shared GM" experiences that focus on narrative first tend to feel as much like <i>exercises</i> as they do <i>games.</i><br/><br/>[Ok, done.

And given that the premise of the thread is "How do I get someone interested in this style of game?", I'm not sure why you'd think it's not relevant to talk about why someone might not be interested. If you don't discuss what doesn't work, how are you ever going to figure out what does?</blockquote>\nI'm going to be absurdly hair-splitty here.<br/><br/>It's not a pitch to <i>anyone</i> that needs to deal with this issue.<br/><br/>It's a pitch to someone who is already into RPGs, and who always thinks of playing just their own character as the core fun...well, that's when that specific pitch becomes important.<br/><br/>In fairness, that's what I was thinking of when I started the thread.<br/><br/>My conclusion fro the responses, each of them useful in their own way, is that such a pitch is effectively impossible for any practical ends for me personally and what I'm working on.<br/><br/>And that's where the idea of creating a new term came from, with an additional thought of a warning chapter or text to pair with it came from ( perhaps as a separate thing).<br/><br/>Text 1: Bobgame;What it is and how to play it and have fun with it!<br/>Text 2: Warning! Bobgame shares these similarities with RPGs, but here are the key differences. You may not love Bobgame despite the similarities, so here's your heads up!<br/><br/>Are two texts necessary? No, not if Bobgame was directed to an audience that had no real familiarity with the common approaches to RPGs.<br/><br/>But it almost certainly will be directed to an audience with that familiarity, so I do feel that sort of thing is necessary.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm having a terrible time separating the two myself. I'm finding it hard to simply write Bobgame without comparison to Not-Bobgame stuff, and especially hard to do it without falling into the trap of using negative comparisons.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439630/#Comment_439630" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-23T12:19:10+00:00" title="October 23, 2014 12:19PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't think the term "distant from the character" necessarily precludes roleplaying your NPCs.  We could be talking about <i>psychological</i> distance, in which you roleplay them but don't mind (or even find it amusing) if they die.  Keeping them in crosshairs, as DVB would say.  I've played wargames like "Squad Leader" this way and it's hysterical.  I want to play chess that way too, after reading that John Wick article.  But when I play that way I don't really care if my guys win, or even survive.  That's different from the way Players typically feel about their PCs, and understandably so.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThat's absolutely what I'm taking about, AsIf.<br/><br/>You are very interested in the character, but it isn't so much of a 1:1 connection that if something terrible happens, or failure happens for the character, that you personally feel something bad has happened to you.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439636/#Comment_439636" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-23T14:20:56+00:00" title="October 23, 2014  2:20PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2014 2:22PM by Rickard.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Personally, I'm having a terrible time separating the two myself.

Both to attract the right target audience but also to early on make the reader understand the purpose of the game. The game mechanics or structure of play then enforces this WHY.<br/><br/>Another effect of this will be that the reader will grok how you designed the game the way you did if they know the reason why the game exists.<br/><br/>This is what I'm experimenting with at the moment. The <b>Murder of Mr. Crow</b> was a failure (<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> didn't understand why the group had to roll the dice in the open). <b>Imagine</b> will hopefully be a step in the right direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
