In my experience a game, no matter how cool, generally isn't enough to make people new to gaming actually play. People curious about this whole tabletop business are mostly just that, curious. They see the potential of an activity being a lot of fun and very different from what they've ever experienced, but they need someone to show it to them.<br>\n<br>\nAll the newcomers I've seen who tried role-playing and who chose to stay were introduced to this hobby by a dedicated group of experienced gamers who created a great campaign/story/whatever together.<br>\n<br>\nI think that especially applies to people... I dunno, over 18? People who are not teenagers. Maybe that's just me, but if I was introduced (or introduced myself) to gaming today, I'd be much more careful with how much time I dedicate to this strange new thing those strange people want me to do...                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294899/#Comment_294899" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T08:37:36+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  8:37AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2010 8:47AM by mease19.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite> ...I know a few people who enjoy RPG books as a unique form of fiction.

I was very much the former, reading and interpreting the rules on my own and then trying to teach the game to friends.  <br/><br/>I am curious how the self-taught vs taught and read/create vs play spectrums interact/correlate.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294908/#Comment_294908" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T08:55:18+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  8:55AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Often character creation with random and/or lifepath elements can be very evocative to create even if play doesn't happen:<br/><br/>Black book Traveller<br/>Cyberpunk 2020<br/>Those old Heroes Now! books<br/>Burning *<br/>There was a really great cyberpunk lifepath program, no longer online but you can download it <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/cyberpunklifepath/" rel="nofollow">here.</a>  I used it A LOT.<br/><br/>They tell you what characters are like in those worlds.

The New Yorker . . . I'm waiting on this week's issue to arrive in order to read this story.<br/><br/>My experiences have led me to conclude that the reason character creation is more appealing than playing is because, when creating a character, one has a singular vision for a him that that is disrupted (traditionally) by the game master and often by the other players.  It\u2019s more appealing to imagine what transpired in the character\u2019s past and what he\u2019s capable of in the future than to deal with having those concepts derailed or unfulfilled in play.<br/><br/>When I realized that, in certain games, my character\u2019s background and what I envisioned for him didn\u2019t matter, I started playing other games where those aspects were relevant--if not indispensible--to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294920/#Comment_294920" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T09:27:13+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  9:27AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of the reason people stop at the reading part, I think, is that they don't want to get into tacky interpersonal encounters.  I have to admit, that's part of why I game online, I get creeped out easily by my fellow gamers... although the encounters I've had here in Seattle with people are nothing but positive.  <br/><br/>I find lifepaths very inspiring, but also PTA-style narrative games.
