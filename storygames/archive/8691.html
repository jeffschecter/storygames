But as written they are like a video game life meter, which got got me thinking.  What if everything about your guy was his arbitrary life meter? <br/>Here's my guy:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/images/universal_hit_points.jpg"/><br/>He's been in a bad scrape and taken 11 points of damage.  That could have reduced his physical stats to zero, killing him, but he chose to spread the hurt around to maintain some level of fighting effectiveness.  So while his Vitality and Awareness did suffer, so did his skill, and when he gets home he's going to find out that his wife Clara is gone (dead?  Run off?  Kidnapped?  Who knows), and although his love for her and their son is shaken it isn't shattered, and the farm is in ruins.  But he still walks, and he's still got his dad's sword, so there's still hope, right?  But another injury of that magnitude and everything in his life will be destroyed.  In this system gaining a hit point might be having a baby or getting a promotion at work or expanding your pig farm.  "Healing" from these wounds might be burying your wife and getting remarried.  <br/><br/>I've explored ablative characters in my games but I know there must be some that I've missed, or are more like my example above.  Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192228/#Comment_192228" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T06:54:08+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  6:54AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminds me of what I've heard about Chad Underkoffler's PDQ system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192229/#Comment_192229" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T06:58:43+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  6:58AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I playtested Dead Inside but it's been 100 years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192237/#Comment_192237" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T07:37:23+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  7:37AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks a lot like Risus.  Each PC is defined by a number of "cliches" (anything from Astronaut, to Brooding Emo Vampire, to Gelatinous Blob, etc), which have numeric ratings.  Whenever you're in a conflict, you roll a number of dice equal to the rating of the appropriate cliche.  If you lose the round, you lose one point from the rating, until any one of your cliches hits zero (when you "die", or are otherwise removed from the conflict).  Healing is accomplished arbitrarily, if I recall.<br/><br/>The trouble with this system is that it promotes a downward spiral.  All things being equal (that is, two opposing cliches with the same rating), whomever loses the first round of a conflict will most likely lose the conflict.  This may or may not be a bad thing, depending on the type of game you're going for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192243/#Comment_192243" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T07:51:17+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  7:51AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More than the downward spiral I think there's an engagement/disengagement thing going on here that would be weird.

You have a number of dice in a relationship which you can call on for a roll, but if you lose the roll, the relationship takes a certain amoung of damage.  So, if you called upon your 3-die relationship with your sister to help win a fight, you'd gain up to 3-dice for that roll,but you if you lost the contested roll, you'd lose some number of those dice from the relationship (I don't remember the exact details), which would represent that relationship getting weaker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192285/#Comment_192285" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T11:54:36+00:00" title="February 12, 2009 11:54AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The idea that an orc slashing you can cause you to go broke, or your wife to leave you, appeals to me.

Attributes are also your "weapons", as it were - their rating determines how many dice you roll. <br/><br/>Sacrificing a motivating attribute means that for the purposes of winning the conflict, all of your dice automatically succeed, so if you sacrifice an attribute rated at 4 you get 4 guaranteed successes.

It's like latitude and longitude for a literary globe. Sorcerer is like this, and it's one of the reasons I sometimes run into difficulty explaining it. Humanity does not represent ability so much as the character's status in the story, and it can work for or against you regardless of its value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
