You can find Sufficiently Advanced <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/sufficiently-advanced" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur group has a bit of a Planescape obsession, but D&amp;D; is an awful fit and I've yet to see a convincing argument for a system complementing it. Sufficiently Advanced has a few things in its favour:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The character's beliefs are mechanically significant.<br/>\n2. The game assumes lots of different cultures which you'll be traveling to - and they're mechanically significant as well.<br/>\n3. Everything is exceptionally lethal or can do horrible things to your characters - but you have a way out if you need it. It will cost you though.<br/>\n4. Your character can be as powerful as you like. You can mix different powered characters together and it won't break the game. Weird characters that don't fit in the normal bounds work just fine (this is why we decided not to use TSoY - we couldn't work out how to allocate stats for, say, my shapeshifting wild mage created out of the chaos matter of Limbo idea, because you can't be generally powerful).<br/>\n5. Isn't player-character centric like The Pool (what we would normally use for Planescape for lack of better options) - the multiverse can *actually* be hostile.<br/>\n<br/>\nConvinced that this was a good idea, we started on our hack. The main thing that needed an overhaul was the Capabilities - in their original form they correspond most closely to D&amp;D;'s core stats - that would have been a fairly straightforward conversion but it wouldn't have made much sense for the setting - magic just isn't classified that way. So instead we went for changing them to the different schools of magic. This involved quite a bit of butchery (for instance - conjuring/summoning now relates to all movement - if you're running away or, say, using a Haste spell (normally Alteration), you'd roll this capability). In actual play it's turned out to be more robust than expected - we haven't run into any situation that we couldn't catagorise under the slightly stretched definitions for each school.<br/>\n<br/>\n(cont.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225301/#Comment_225301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T00:54:45+00:00" title="August 18, 2009 12:54AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are the tables we came up with (still probably a bit rough, but meh):<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Abjuration:<br/>\nDefense against harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

Fortunately, someone else had already worked this one out for us <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://suffadv.wikidot.com/forum/t-46880/theme-generation-revision" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This ends up looking like this:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">First, the player picks the import of the character: 9, 8, 7, or 5. This gives the number of points available for capabilities.<br/>\nEach capability costs the square of it's value in points (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nImport 5 gives 512 points (enough to put 8 in each category).<br/>\nImport 7 gives 256 points.<br/>\nImport 8 gives 128 points.<br/>\nImport 9 gives 64 points.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAlso, the character's race is a free profession in the same way as locality - automatic 5. This was to account for innate abilities that are far above the character's actual capability, but makes general good sense - you should be pretty good at being what you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's basically it as we're currently using it, but we have some more thoughts being thrown around in email that haven't made it into play yet. One thing we've been arguing about a lot is the role of spells and items. 2/3rds of the group would like them to have mechanical effects - say, a Shield spell automatically negates a Magic Missile attack without rolling, or an Invisibility spell giving +10 bonus to the result of a relevant Illusion roll. The other player would prefer to not change this part of the system to keep it simple. No one's really willing to force their point of view at this point, so we're sticking with the status quo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else I proposed was that the players of off-screen characters would be able to roll against their core values to have some minor influence in scenes that they're not in (and are relevant to that belief, obviously). Almost all of our games have been only with two people so far though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're also considering how to make it less necessary to hammer only one particular reserve pool during extended conflicts - at the moment (as we're reading the rules, anyway) there's a strong mechanical disincentive to change tactics during an extended conflict - if you go from trying to win someone over to trying to kill them, all your effort in getting their Charm reserve down is wasted. We don't have a satisfactory solution yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225303/#Comment_225303" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T00:55:59+00:00" title="August 18, 2009 12:55AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A brief sketch of actual play:<br/>\nIn the main game we're running of this at the moment, my character has (mostly through force of belief ('don't be evil: 2') and extremely lucky dice rolls) stood her ground against an Abyssal Lord who wished to dominate her mind and have her murder her friends so that she could be molded as his apprentice/queen (my character is an alu-fiend with a 3 in the Romance theme, if that helps put it in perspective).<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving failed utterly to even scratch her charm reserve, he decides that good is sexy anyway and proposes to her on the spot (the 'befriended by the enemy' complication in play). She decides to stay in his realm, given that this helps her quest for knowledge and she's afraid that if she doesn't he might kill her - but is rather lukewarm to the idea of becoming his queen. Using her Empathy theme, she's gained the trust of his undead blood-drinking sister and is on the road to making the 802nd layer of the Abyss a tolerable place.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, who knows what will happen if the extended conflict with the Abyssal Lord trying to win her affection turns out poorly. His capabilities are in the demigod range, and one of his core values is 'Inflicting eternal torment on those that wrong him: 9'. Furthermore, my character's romance descriptor states that her romances tend not to work out too well. I anticipate a horrible future for my character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225605/#Comment_225605" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T21:46:01+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  9:46PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds hot. <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1331" rel="nofollow">My heart has developed so many boners</a> for <i>Planescape</i> that I make reference to the City of Doors in every single fantasy game I run or play, from <i>Earthdawn</i> to <i>Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies</i>.<br><br>Now I am direly wanting to play SA, just to try this hack.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226827/#Comment_226827" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T19:40:30+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  7:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You really seemed to shoot for "10 is the highest ever," which I assume was intentional.

It hasn't come up as a thing with the player characters - we've all got import of 8 - but I don't think it will ever be a problem. Basically, the source material doesn't (in general) allow you to just stretch out with your alteration power and modify reality a plane away - you need to justify how you're doing that, and that generally means some spell or artifact - even the gods can't just wave their hands and have stuff happen when it gets to that level. For instance - Cyric casts a spell in the novel Prince of Lies that's plainly a 10 divination to discover where a soul another god has hidden is - to do this he needs to cast a spell (which he needs to find in the first place) requiring the death of hundreds of his followers and a huge surge of worship to power. Karsus with his god-power stealing spell requires components like the pituitary gland of the tarrasque and the gizzard of a gold dragon - and it took him 10 years to research it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes - while it's possible to do whatever the hell you please with that level of power - you still need to justify it in the setting and it's a lot different from the vanilla SA where you have immediate access to whatever technology you fancy. And let's face it - most times you don't need that kind of power anyway. Sure - you can destroy the entire Plane, but more likely you want to wipe out the guy in front of you, and your 10 is going to be handy for that too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis game is going brilliantly now that we've got a firm grasp on the SA rules (or at least, a decision on how to interpret all the things we find ambiguous). I've just had a conflict with a deva I rescued earlier regarding my character's apparent siding with the forces of evil and the general utter ruin of her reputation. I like the way anything can be thrown at you but if you really oppose it you're given the resources to fight tooth and nail. Ari (my alu-fiend character) really believes in what she's doing - the deva is trying to convince her it's evil and cowardly - and I spend all of my reserve mostly in defending. There's no way to win - a loss means she's convinced and by this point I don't consider that an option - but I have twists at the price of being kidnapped. It's her empathy for the blood-drinking undead fiend Talissa that keeps her belief strong! The deva challenges her Abyssal Lord lover (well, not quite yet - but let's face it - that's how that conflict is going to turn out without major changes to their relationship) - I burn more twists to get *him* to be more worried about her being upset than killing the deva - who promptly abducts Ari. A daring escape later, and there's war brewing down in the Abyss - should be messy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlah - I'm gushy about this <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> It's the only Planescape game we've managed to run that's consistently good and that we can point to the system and say 'And that's helping us make it good!'.
