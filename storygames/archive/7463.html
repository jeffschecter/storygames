Either clearly mark minions as minions or describe them in a manner than makes it very obvious. The DMG also covers this in that D&amp;D; is a game made up of exceptions and "gotcha" scenarios where you thoughts things were one way but because of a power, feat, trap... the normal rules don't apply. In general the designers advise that you always tip the players off and warn them instead of surprising them. Describing a demon's 10 foot aura as potentially damaging, using PCs passive skill checks to auto detect traps, and so on. Since it is a resource game, they want to avoid PCs spending resources in situations where they may feel cheated. Damn, I just spent my daily power on a bunch of minions! Crap!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165908/#Comment_165908" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T08:38:21+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  8:38AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is no "supposed to" or "not supposed to".  That's been left to individual DM choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the way the designers do it is to make sure the players know who is and isn't a minion.  As Justin notes, Mearls uses narrative description to highlight the difference between scrubs and non scrubs.  But simply placing the minis / tokens down on the table and saying "these are minions" is just fine too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game was balanced with the idea of players being able to optimize minion attacks vs. non minion attacks, so playing without that knowledge will ramp up the difficulty signficantly.  Especially when you start getting into the higher level minions who can actually do some scary stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165909/#Comment_165909" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T08:41:59+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  8:41AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>For players or the GM?

I can now offer ideas:<br><br>* Get some of the smallish, cheap plastic poker chips (I'm sure there's 1" diameter ones) and stack the bosses (or various classes) on top, leaving mooks without chips. Three or four colors should cover all of your needs, not to mention being able to trivially stack up to three, for "ranking", in addition to color. Note that this might not be as cool for doublebase, quadbase (but are there even any large/gigantic minions?).<br><br>* Trick from the Pirates TCG: use colored braces rubber bands to indicate specialness/uberness--just hang themon whatever's convenient: head, horns, weapon, upraised arm. This technique is also cool for marking and cursing.<br><br>* Again, influenced by Pirates TCG (and a bit of Mechaton thrown in) use TINY d6s to indicate whatever. You have both color and numbers 1-6 to use for differentiation.<br><br>* Legos, man... Legos. Use small square plates in a manner similar to the chips above (and morre scalable, if there's larger minions or classes). You can use Pick-a-Brick of Digital Designer to just buy the ones you know you'd most-often use (or to color customize or whatever).<br><br>* For that matter, as soon as you introduce using alternate figures in general (i.e. other than actual minis), then I can verify that Icehouse pyramids offers a LOT of flexibility, once you have about three or four Treehouse sets (<a href="http://www.looneylabs.com/whybuy/treehouse.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>). And the bonus is that you can use small beads or tiny dice UNDER the transparent pyramids, for mark or curse.<br><br>* If you're definitely going with minis, maybe try using those little colored dot stickers, or even Post-It flags (<a href="http://www.mmm.com/us/office/postit/products/prod_ft_ss.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>) stuck to the base or to the figure back or wherever.<br><br>And I'm spent, though I'm sure there's a bajillion other, cheap ways if you wander a crafts store with an open mind....                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165921/#Comment_165921" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T09:08:33+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  9:08AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, some really good suggestions there, thank you.

Her policy is to somehow point out the biggest threat on the board, but not to indicate anything about which figures might be minions.<br/><br/>I told her that made it a bit of a shell game because there is no way of telling the difference without some sort of clues. To me, killing a monster with one hit doesnt tell me its a minion, it tells me that part of the fight is over. It doesn't help to know after the fact.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166022/#Comment_166022" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T19:33:06+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  7:33PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been "playtesting" 4e with my group several times (whenever we fall below critical #'s for regular game and once when scoping out next 4e campaign) and have been not naming "here's a minion" but describing creatures in ways pretty clearly dileniating them, "these are decrepit looking skeletons, but that one looks fierce and deadly", "the bandits look like ill-kempt rabble who are only really a threat because of their numbers and surprise, it's that halfling slinger who ordered the attack who looks deadly", "these kobolds keep looking to the ones in the ornate armour for reassurance".<br/><br/>That's been fine with group, the ones most up on 4e are quickly identifying the minions.<br/><br/>I don't however reveal when the perception check notes the bushes are concealing something that the something is a minion.  The one nod perhaps to simulationism is that you need to get a look at the creature/see them in action/interaction to assess them.<br/><br/>I would also not be above a tricky villain "dressing up some minions as menaces" but still let Perception or other checks reveal the hoax.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166023/#Comment_166023" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T19:38:48+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  7:38PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2008 7:40PM by johnzo.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always differentiate the minions.  For minions I use cheap paper figures that can be printed in People's Liberation Army quantities.  Real plastic figures are reserved for the guys with hit points. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>my DM makes it clear when something is a minion by the way they act. They <i>know</i> they are doomed for a short life and are paper ninjas.</blockquote>\nLast session one of my kobold minions rolled a natural 20 to bull-rush a burly dragonborn ranger off an elevated observation platform.  The damage from the fall put the ranger down hard.  I didn't have the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/files/dragon/364_Creature_Incarnations.pdf" rel="nofollow">kobold victory table</a> (dndinsider reg. required, sorry) handy, but I did let the kobold take a round to hoot and celebrate.<br/><br/>Had the little guy survived, he would have been promoted to dragonshield and become a named NPC.  Hell, maybe I'll say he did survive, he was just conked out in the fighting and slipped away...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
