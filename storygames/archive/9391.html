Have no risk of forgetting his answers.  All relevant info available at once, rather than getting one detail at a time.  Decreases time and energy spent getting, retaining, processing, and reasoning from environmental info.  Forms strong basis for players to generate their own mental pictures of what their characters are seeing during the fight.<br/><br/>Hinders immersion:<br/>Your focus is on a piece of graph paper, and manipulating the dots and lines drawn on it.  This is a distraction from imagining yourself somewhere other than teh game table.  Being able to track everything so easily does not resemble the experience of dodging swords and ducking around pillars in a dim room.<br/><br/>My experience with the paper obsession has led me to GM with hidden maps... up until the second or third time when someone struggles to remember/visualize something their character would obviously know, at which point I show it to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208210/#Comment_208210" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T16:15:48+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  4:15PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 8:29PM by Nathan_H.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you still asking a question?<br/>Unless that map is a part of the fiction, like say the hand drawn map in Seven Samurai or the Death Star hologram in Star Wars, I'd say it's an immersion killer, atleast temporarily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208211/#Comment_208211" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T16:20:15+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  4:20PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think maps help players who are uncaring get immersed by having a physical object to focus their attention on.<br/><br/>For hardcore immersion though, a lack of map lets you visualize things, which is better than a mere map.

So many people tend to forget the "game" in role-playing games.  Games NEED structure to hang the fun on.  That can be in the form of the rules, the referee (GM), turns, the dice, the playing-board (map), etc...<br/><br/>I have three reasons for my thought that rely on one another:<br/>1.  player decision making ability<br/>2.  structure for imagination<br/>3.  shortcut to fun<br/><br/>Imagination is a wonderful thing, the only problem is - my imagination (as GM) sometimes differs from what the players imagine.  Many-times my descriptions, no matter how well given, miss something that's vitally important (to the player) for the decision making abilities of the CHARACTERS  - because their players then don't have "correct" or fair information to "give" the character to react with...  if the players don't have complete information, and make a decision they would normally NEVER make, then the IMMERSION for the characters completely breaks.  <br/>As opposed - giving the players a little MORE than the characters should have  (ie. the overhead map)  reduces the chance to have that imagination from description wrongly and unfairly influence the in-game decisions of the characters.<br/><br/>I'd rather my players have a bit more and reduce chances that lead to problems due to differing imagination of the scene.  In many cases I've described a situation and had players get frustrated when THEY FEEL the GM "changes" the description on them when they make a tactical move... or they consider an idea and then get to their turn to "learn" it's 20' NOT 15' away as they imagined.<br/>The lack of HARD information leads to incorrect assumptions and often-times bad feelings on game calls.<br/><br/><br/>THAT fact leads me to say that giving a map is LESS immersion breaking than not giving a map.  Because the problems that result (many times) is MORE immersion breaking than not having a clear framework in which to set the rest of the scene descriptions.<br/>Afterall - what you're giving  (when you give a map)  is a framework... a guideline... a structure to HANG all the descriptions of the scene on.  Seeing the SHAPE and SIZE of the "box" doesn't give away the prize, it just builds the anticipation and imagination.<br/><br/><br/>Lastly - many of us don't have the TIME to spend on detailed descriptions, so that everyone has the exact mental picture.  Alternatively, some of us don't have the descriptive capability to build a detailed description narrative as others might...  For both/either of these points - having a simple map is a great tool to shortcut to a general image of where the scene is set for the players to take (individually)  or  to add ideas or ask questions to clarify  (as a group)  on the scene description.  A picture is worth 1000 words afterall, and that TIME shortcut allows the game scene and the FUN of the action/drama to continue with a (correctly) shared image of the scene...<br/><br/><br/>That's my feeling.<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208219/#Comment_208219" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T16:52:08+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  4:52PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm neutral about maps and immersion.

Static maps of static situations don't generally have that problem.  A map of a city tends to be consistent with later descriptions.  Even if the city is burned down, you can usually still recall the map for an image consistent with how the characters are interacting with the ruins.  This makes such a map very useful as a framework for building and updating mental models of the situation.  Once that framework is in place, the map is benignly redundant and so the player's attention will go straight from the mental model to the situation, exactly what is wanted for immersion.  Similarly, a scene map or tactical map might aid immersion if it is presented only in regards to a duration of time in which the scene is relatively static, and then taken away before the scene is described as changing.  Including characters in the map, even for that short duration of time, probably breaks immersion since they will be imagined in terms of inferred behaviors, and so they are never truly static.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_208236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208236/#Comment_208236" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T19:29:24+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  7:29PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 7:29PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The geographical map gives a lot to the dialogue of the game, in my experience.

So, hmm....<br/><br/>* World Maps - I consider these to be at least as useful as setting fiction, NPC character sketches, and player handouts with journal entries, weird puzzles, or whatever. I'm not going to fool with "immersion," except to say that the group's sharing of the imagined space takes precedent over one player's need to be solely responsible for his or her internal vision of that space. Which means:<br/><br/>* Tactical Maps - As all above have said, they keep things accurate in crunch games. D&amp;D: a must; BW: a hindrance, though i find the Reach/Range Sliders Chart I made for BWHQ to be very good for keeping track of the relevant modifiers and positioning test tweaks; DitV: irrelevant. Yep, (*sigh*) it's all relative to the game being played. I could go even further, though:<br/><br/>* Miniature Settings - Why stop with hating a hand-drawn map and minis on it? Let's hate on the whole modeling hobby, who bring (what I once thought were) cool-as-hell blown-out buildings, snap-together dungeon tiles with 3D doors and chest, rolling hills and scattered trees and gullies for hiding in. But, wait! As I recall from actual play, such settings actually make me MORE immersed in the flow of the game: I may have a unique ability in that I can look at a flock-modeled tree and see, instead, its branches swaying in the wind, teasing smoke with its leaves, its roots stretching across the ground to trip the living or embrace the fallen. I can look at a 3D dungeon tile and see the water-slicked, mossy walls, hear the scrabble of rats and drips of ichor from the floor above, see the dim, flickering torchlight. And, yep, when I see a bog-standard miniature from (say) MageKnight or D&amp;D, I can *still* imagine all the personalizing details its player tells me about attire or wild eyes or bushy beards.<br/><br/>In short: bupkiss to the haters. If your "immersion" is threatened by a visual aide, then your imagination needs more exercise--I haven't seen kids play with action figures be totally constrained to the figures range of motion and scale (and I almost NEVER see kids just sitting and telling stories, without dolls or toys or figures or drawings).<br/><br/>And if you have any notion of actually *sharing* the imagined space--which includes accuracy in equal parts with individual imaginative vibrancy--then a visual aide is about the ONLY way to be 100% certain that everyone "sees" the same thing in their minds' eyes. So then the *degree* to which one uses a visual aide should reflect the need for coherence in the SIS. D&amp;D needs a lot, because every 10' counts. DitV needs almost none, as tactics take a back seat to narrative flow and the dice mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208730/#Comment_208730" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T12:39:16+00:00" title="May 22, 2009 12:39PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Kev's got a really important observation about the importance of sharing info the characters would have.  When that doesn't happen, you wind up with clashing visions and undoing actions/events... which of course is toxic to any attempt to "lose yourself" in the imagined sequence.<br/><br/>I think we all agree here that maps are one way to share such info.  I guess one of the most pertinent questions is, are there <i>better</i> ways?  Ways that carry fewer immersive downsides?  As for those downsides:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>If your "immersion" is threatened by a visual aide, then your imagination needs more exercise</blockquote>This is a point I've heard a lot, and although I agree with it, I don't think it really covers what I've experienced in play.  Let's imagine two types of players trying to immerse:<br/><br/>Player A:<br/>This player doesn't want to put any effort into immersing.  He just wants the GM to manage everything, so he can just think in-character 100% of the time.  The second the real-world experience of playing a game with other people intrudes on his consciousness, he gets pissy.  "Something stopped me from thinking in-character; my immersion is ruined.  This sucks."<br/><br/>Player B:<br/>This player is committed to imagining himself in the fiction as an active endeavor.  He strives to accommodate the practical realities of collaborative play; to deal with what must be dealt with, to minimize that which can safely be minimized, and to not get all bent out of shape in any case.  When his immersion is interrupted, he tries to quicly rediscover the groove.  He has some practice playing this way, and while he is successful overall, he doesn't have perfect control over his reactions, nor perfect ability to instantly re-immerse after interruptions.  <br/><br/>So, let's not talk about Player A.  He's a waste of our effort.  The question is whether or not Player B might find some downsides to maps.  In my experience, the answer is yes.  It's one more thing in the real world that calls attention to itself during time that could otherwise be spent seeing through the character's eyes -- much like dice, character sheets, drinks, fellow players, hunger, etc., etc.  Perhaps more satisfying play, from an immersion standpoint, could be achieved using some procedure or ritual instead of a physical map?  Or perhaps a map can be best used for initial orientation, to establish some facts, but then put away, denying the players short-hand reference and instead forcing them to engage their imaginations when making character decisions (a la Burr's suggestion)?<br/><br/>I think there are two ways we can view this real-world interactivity issue of maps:<br/>1) distraction<br/>2) path of least resistance<br/><br/>Regarding simply denying the players an easy way to do something, forcing them instead to do it in a slower and more demanding manner that furthers some tangential goal (e.g. immersion), I'm torn.  Maybe the simple answer is, "If you really want immersion, avoid tactical combats."  But I'd like to have my cake and eat it too.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208738/#Comment_208738" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T13:45:19+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  1:45PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very situational.

Maps that feature a lot of Color (textures, hand-drawn, signed by the mapmaker, pretty) could help with immersion, if they communicate something about the feeling of a place.<br/><br/>2. Maps that are just simple graphics used to illustrate a point ("The dot here is you, right? The tree on your left is about... here... and the orc is somewhere over here. Got it?") are a useful tool for communication.<br/><br/>3. What I hate is something that is kind of in-between. Like when you take a nice, colorful map from your Warhammer game and use it to represent the battlefield in a low-fantasy D&amp;D game. And it's got bullet-holes punched into it, and a burning tank in the left corner. The Color of the map distracts from what I'm trying to imagine.<br/><br/>If the map is not just a schematic, it'd better be EXACTLY RIGHT, or I have to work hard to ignore parts of it, even though I'm supposed to refer to it all the time in play.<br/><br/>4. How do you present the map? If you just plop it down, like "the cavern looks like this!", I'd say the overall effect is to reduce immersion, in a sense. Because you're NOT going to describe things as much. The players aren't going to ask the GM to describe as much, either. <br/><br/>Some highly imaginative players might still "immerse" in their own imagination, but it's not "Shared", is it? They're generating some image of their own based on the map, and imagining that as hard as they can. But we don't know what that is.<br/><br/>I think for immersion, at least of a certain type, it's good to have as much talk and description as possible--lots of "sensory input" for the characters. My feeling is that, generally, when the GM pulls outs a map, a) the GM is likely to speak less, and just let people look at the map, and b) the players are less likely to ask questions ("what's the wall on the left side look like/feel life?"), as their attention is now focused on the piece of paper on the table.<br/><br/>If you have a map that conveys the mood or feeling or whatever you want, go for it. Like those nice hand-drawn maps, or maps that are "within the fiction" (i.e. look just like whatever they represent in the gameworld). If not, my preference is to use description, and go to simple drawing/sketches as a tool for explanation, only when necessary. When the players start going, "wait, how far am I from the door, again?" then I draw a few dots and/or lines on the paper, but spare enough that they don't create any imagery on their own.<br/><br/>That's my take on it. I think. It's probably different for everybody.<br/><br/>But "immersive, tactical combat"? When I hear that, I think, "we make a careful plan beforehand" (i.e. use a map/sketch here), and, "when the fight breaks out, everything goes to shit" (describe everything in visceral, vague, terms, like through a blurry lens).<br/><br/>I'm not seeing "immersive, tactical combat" with a battlemat and hexes and all that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208741/#Comment_208741" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T13:58:23+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  1:58PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar Slaad</cite><br/>It's also very player dependent.

I can get good millage out of reading if I have a specific goal in mind, but lectures often just fly right by.<br/><br/>When I first heard about D&amp;D, I was skeptical because it sounded like there was nothing solid and visual to hang onto. Once I saw that indeed there was (even though we didn't start with minis - there was the dungeon map), I became sold, and even more so once we started using minis.<br/><br/>When I have played a purely verbal game, I have often been confused.

But the group still ran into the same issues that David listed as hindering immersion.<br/><br/>My group in question doesn't play games to be "hotbeds of conflicts and emotions", nor do they expect the combats to be "simulations of high-paced action, anger and fear".  Not every group does; not every game system can honestly be expected to deliver that kind of experience.  To me, immersion is simply <i>the sense of being there</i> and usually with this group the most I can expect is for them to be <i>enthusiastic and focused</i>.  The map certainly delivered more of the latter than I was getting previously, even if it was merely making up for my shortcomings as a GM.<br/><br/>Yes, our combats have improved.  And that <i>is</i> because we are making better game experiences out of it.  Whether they are believable combat-simulations frankly hasn't changed by the introduction of a map.  There's only so much that's believable when players are spending Drama Points to blast nanite-zombies and rad-scorpions into atomic dust with turbo plasma rifles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar" title="salvagebar"><img alt="salvagebar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar">salvagebar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210250/#Comment_210250" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T17:56:23+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  5:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2009 6:01PM by salvagebar.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Our combats are hotbeds of conflicts and emotions, due to the fact that we do not try to "keep everything straight".

I have found that, when GMs say "I like my combats chaotic! I believe in fog-of-war!", the exchange is something like the following:<br/><br/><b>GM: Roll initiative. (points at me) What do you do?<br/>Me: (inhales, as I require air to speak)<br/>GM: OK, you sit there and drool. (points to next player)</b><br/><br/>...and so on. This is not making combats intense, this is just being rude to your players. I see your point - it's hard for everyone in a real battle to have the same picture of what is happening. I'm interested in seeing if this kind of combat management <i>at the table in the real world,</i> among the players and GM, can be negotiated in a way that doesn't involve bullying.<br/><br/>Then there is the story logic point that Quintin brought up. I have been in fights, been knocked out, gotten mugged - never been in combat. But my character may be a battle-hardened survivor of countless wars, who has buried the bodies of dozens of friends, and could chew up the lot of us before his morning coffee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210259/#Comment_210259" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T19:56:42+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  7:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2009 7:57PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone, <b>PLEASE KEEP THIS THREAD ABOUT MAPS</b>.<br/><br/>I already asked Tomas and Quintin to use whispers, but they both ignored me.

And further, is there a way to keep up that pace with multiple players being involved? With or without a map, in a five PC game, the player who goes last tends to have a whole lot more time to end up thinking, a lot of which may be outside of the character's headspace, whether they want that or not.<br/><br/>At a guess, btw, I'd say putting out the map, then taking it away is likely to be counterproductive unless the situation is extremely static and likely to stay that way or incredibly simple. In a fluid situation, players are going to want to see the map again if they've already seen it once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210274/#Comment_210274" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T23:56:08+00:00" title="June  3, 2009 11:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>might this be sufficient to achieve the clarity you guys mentioned?</blockquote>\nNot for me, but like I say, I have to be actually doing what my character does to achieve that (which I normally am not really seeking, but since someone asked...)<br/><br/>I like the idea, though. I think it might be cool to try it out. I'm thinking a bit of the "preview" that is shown in Plants vs. Zombies, in which you are given a pretty clear idea of which zombies your plants will face on the level, and in what proportion, but you can only see it before you start the level.  I think one of the special abilities in the Starcraft/Warcraft RTS series is to reveal parts of the map you haven't explored yet and spy for about 5-8 seconds on the enemies there. Then you return to uncertainty. Whether it increases immersion or not, it's certainly an interesting <i>strategic</i> idea. A test of memory if implemented in a certain way...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210279/#Comment_210279" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T05:18:58+00:00" title="June  4, 2009  5:18AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Figures on a hand drawn tactical map don't give much flavor - more than just drawing circles and squares on a hand drawn map but not much.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in the early 90's I ran a Call of Cthulhu game where the players had painted figures, roughly to scale cars and the monster figures where the monsters. I laid out a simple drop cloth terrain field, put lichen on it and a few trees and some simple terrain bits. The field was the scene so if there was an interesting looking Egyptian looking shrine it was there - as well as the half hidden open sarcoficas in the bushes near by. This world very well. I can't speak to the immersion because I wasn't playing in the game but running it. It was visually fun though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to go down the modeling road it is a great life long obsession but speaking as a gamer I don't do that much now because I found it didn't add enough to my games to warrent the time and effort of getting it together. Now my little guys sit in a glass case and look pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

If the combat system grants benefits from ranges or facing or cover or flanking or terrain or any of a number of <i>spatial aspects</i>, then the players are going to need to be constantly apprised of how those aspects are changing because the characters will likely try to take advantage of them as best they can.  So the players will be constantly trying to get a feel of where everything's at, leading to constant questions and trouble with visualization.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I never once felt the lack of a map when playing Dogs, since none of those spatial aspects were really relevant to the combat system, except perhaps as color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210364/#Comment_210364" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T12:25:43+00:00" title="June  4, 2009 12:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the OP's setup of "experiencing things from your character's POV is a top priority" pretty much answers his own question, that maps ruin that level of immersion (in that scenario). <br/><br/>My group's version of immersion is just fine with maps.

Newman</cite>This is a problem. Prioritize.</blockquote>The priority on the player level is character POV over orc-vanquishing.  But then on the character level, there's a high priority on orc-vanquishing, and character POV breaks if the player isn't allowed to vanquish orcs with all the needed info.  "Well, I wouldn't have done that if I'd known he was 3 feet away," is the worst-case scenario, much suckier than a bit of drag as I determine "3 feet away".<br/><br/>This does, however, beg for the point to be made: sometimes a handy map can show you <i>more</i> than your character knows.  So, that's one thing to avoid here.<br/><br/>Quintin, I hope that answers your question as well.  Spatial aspects impact resolution (though the GM handles this to reduce player handling time).<br/><br/>KBob, handling time is definitely one significant factor.  Sometimes, though, sharing info via 2 minutes of description might be more immersive than via 30 seconds of map-staring.  But I agree in general with diminishing handling time where possible.  Also, good point about "if they've seen the map once, they'll want to check it when that'd be handy."  I don't want to force a memory-test challenge on them, as J.D. pointed out.  I want to make remembering as easy as possible.<br/><br/>ME, there's no question that maps have some downsides.  It's just a question of which techniques come out ahead in the end, as they <i>all</i> have downsides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
