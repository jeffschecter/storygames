All basically an admission that people don't like playing healers.<br/><br/>The question I have is why? Medical dramas like ER are quite popular, hell MASH was too, and plenty of people want to be doctors so they can help people. It's a fantasy that plenty of people have. Also, in AD&amp;D 2e, the Cleric was pretty much the most powerful class, up until 8th level or so (and a lot more gaming happened in those 8 levels than the remaining 12). Apparently nobody wanted to be the cleric though. Evidently, there's something wrong with the idea of being a healer in an RPG, and I can't figure out what it is.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281331/#Comment_281331" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T15:02:30+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  3:02PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're playing a non-combat character in a combat-based game.

In D&amp;D, sure, clerics were very powerful on their own, even the potentially most powerful class in the game. But when it came down to healing and the burden is on your shoulders, it's just like...all your comrades are having fun, jumping in the fight and you're hanging back and taking care of them, paying attention to their health. It's like playing a concerned parent in a playground full of kids, not a doctor. Ok, I've actually just described WoW, not D&amp;D, but there are parallels. <br/><br/>That said, I don't think this is a general trend in any way. I don't know any people who specifically don't want to be a healer or cleric. I wouldn't say it's widespread. And if there is a trend, then it's because <i>the games implemented healing in a bland and boring way</i>. I think that's your answer, if there is one. There is absolutely no excitement in casting a heal spell because your buddy was a jackass and taunted the dragon one too many times. Especially if the mechanic is not engaging in any way. The spell just takes up your time that you could have spent doing something more action-y (which D&amp;D is all about). D&amp;D is a poor example to go by, because, sure, why would you be healing your buddies (who are killing monsters) if the game is all about killing monsters. Plus, D&amp;D's got hitpoints. Healing is just a tactical resource management where you refill a bar of points when it's appropriate to do so. There's nothing <i>medical</i> about it, no wounds, no nothing.<br/><br/>Having and using medical skills in BW is a lot more important and cooler than having a "Cure Light Wounds" spell. Playing an Angel in Apocalypse World is awesome. Playing a barber-surgeon in Warhammer is fun.<br/><br/>Also, isn't Jason Morningstar writing Medical Hospital, a doctor RPG?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281334/#Comment_281334" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T15:12:22+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  3:12PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2010 3:14PM by migo.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: This is in response to post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, 3 came up after I submitted.<br/><br/>Except, it's not true. The 2e Cleric was a combat powerhouse. Access to 80% of the powerful weapons, at will attacks taking out a significant portion of enemies (turn undead), the ability to cast spells while in armour (some of them also very powerful, cleric wielding a staff or a club and shield can cast shillelagh, being the only starting character capable of taking on certain creatures that need magical items to hit). If you want to solo in AD&amp;D, cleric is the way to go, with fighter and thief being a fair bit behind as 2nd and 3rd (in either order), and a wizard being an even more distant fourth.

Which is not a complicated game action, and does not call for creativity or innovation or anything more than being able to do some math (don't waste a <i>cure serious</i> when a <i>cure medium</i> will do).<br/><br/>Healing is, in many games, a passive role.  Other people go and do things, and then come to you to get more hit points so they can go back out and do more things.  And yet many games treat it as an active role:  the healer has to be there and make the roll or cast the spell for the healing to occur, which means that the healer can't be out doing other things at the same time.  That kinda sucks, and I can't blame anyone for not wanting to take on that role in a game when they could be playing a character who has more freedom.<br/><br/><br/>And yeah, clerics in D&amp;D were stupid powerful, but I think the reason why 3e let good-aligned clerics switch any spell for a healing spell on the fly was so that they could actually have a chance of using their other powers instead of just racking nothing but healing spells all the time, every time.  I know back in AD&amp;D2e, groups I played in had a firm expectation that a cleric would be providing healing, and if a cleric's player memorized other spells instead, it was considered a HUGE faux pas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281341/#Comment_281341" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T15:24:12+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  3:24PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This makes for an interesting idea for a game.

This is in fifteen years of play. I just want to make it clear that I speak from experience.<br/><br/>Playing a healer is boring. I did it because I wanted a role that had a short list of moves that were nearly always usable; the boredom was an asset to me. In hindsight, I was trying to set myself up to Do The Obvious Thing all the time. But most games make their healers the vanilla dude with the fewest interesting choices to make, the guy with zero points and twelve assists, as much furniture as character. The most recent <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0735.html#" rel="nofollow">Order of the Stick</a>, where Durkon and the Minister are commiserating about how the cleric's job is endless and thankless (and almost pointless, really) in a D&amp;D-type setting, rings way true. The "role" of a healer in most games can be straight-up replaced by just giving people more HP. Some designers have done exactly that. Not everyone can design Apocalypse World's Angels, and not every game wants them.<br/><br/>By the way, did you play the same D&amp;D2 as me? The only way clerics were powerful was if you used stuff like the Forgotten Realms kit priests, and chose a god that made you 75% fighter. Priests of Leira, for instance? I played one from level 1-14, and no, not so much. Opportunities to lie to goblins and take their stuff are vastly outnumbered by opportunities to kill them (healing your buddies along the way) and take their stuff.<br/><br/>* Every campaign D&amp;D character I've ever played but one was a cleric. NERO LARP? Played a healer (Earth mage). Mage: The Ascension, for crying out loud: Life 3 Prime 2, and guess what I did with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281351/#Comment_281351" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T16:58:02+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  4:58PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Level 1 cleric, 8-10hp, 2-4 first level spells, splint mail for AC 4 or lower, footman's flail, shield, turn undead.<br/><br/>The cleric is effectively as powerful as the average 1st level fighter, a bit short when it comes to specialisation, and an elf fighter could get a bit of an edge for combat, but particularly with AC 7-10 opponents, that extra +1 to +2 for THAC0 didn't make a huge difference.<br/><br/>There's an entire category of enemies, with zombies and skeletons quite common at low levels, that the cleric is the most powerful class against, and a thief's backstab is entirely useless against.<br/><br/>A level 1 wizard was also pretty weak, because for combat effectiveness the best spell was sleep, but again against undead it would switch to chill touch, which was then less useful against the living. The cleric got some specific effectiveness against undead, general effectiveness against other creatures, and with spells like shillelagh, command and cause fear all the bases covered.

With the exception of Second Wind actions, which you can only do once per encounter, 4E Healing Surges simply replace healing utility magic like healing potions and wands of cure light wounds that were always available between combats in previous editions.  For real in-combat resilience you definitely want a Leader.  And as far as death saves, if you want to just roll the dice on death saves w/o someone to assist you with curative powers, well, I'd guess either you're not as attached to your characters as I sometimes become, or your 4E DMs have been wearing kid-gloves more often than than any of mine.  (or than I do when I run it)<br/><br/>Further, the role name of "Leader" in 4E is not a simple re-branding of the classic healer role from previous editions.  2nd &amp; 3rd edition D&amp;D Clerics were exceptionally powerful to tempt people to play them because they were generally pretty dull to play, this because they're best spell  and action resources in most situations was simply to heal someone - very passive.  In 4E, because of minor actions (they can heal as a minor action and still do other things on their turn) and because many of the healing Powers are more aggressive and interesting than a vanilla heal, e.g. having to strike an enemy to heal your allies, 4E Leaders are <i>much</i> more interesting to play.  None of the 4E groups I've played in for run for ever have had a sense of someone having to suck it up and take one for the team to play a healer.  The most common party configuration has a pure Leader and a pseudo-Leader class as well like a Defender/Leader or Controller/Leader.  And most of the encounters need every ounce of that healing ability....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281360/#Comment_281360" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T17:31:48+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  5:31PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Admittedly I haven't played 4e that extensively, but the one time I did play a priest in 4e I didn't cast a single healing spell, and I don't recall seeing that many cast in other situations either.

When things go well, you don't need to do much healing, and a Second Wind or two is enough to keep the party functioning. When things go badly, and especially when, say, a striker or controller runs off on their own, healing vastly improves the party's survivability. Although 4e does reduce the overall need for healing, unless you're really consistently effective you'll still want a leader of some description. And more importantly, 4e made it so that every leader character can heal *and* do other neat stuff. The base healing powers are all minor actions, and the special healing powers tend to have other interesting (and in not a few cases offensive) effects. For me playing a warlord in 4e is really rewarding, since I can get into the thick of things and beat up the bad guys, yet through healing and other helpful powers I get to help keep the entire party functioning.<br/><br/>The thing about clerics in D&amp;D is that their role in the game has changed and become muddied over time. As I understand it they were originally meant to be templars. They'd fight with armor and weapons not quite as good as the Fighting Man's, and then use a bunch of nifty non-combat holy magic to patch up the party, provide food, etc. between battles. But for most of the game's history clerics were the only healer/priest characters, and the notion that they were priests who inexplicably wear chainmail affected how they were designed in successive editions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281368/#Comment_281368" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T18:29:23+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  6:29PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I remember reading BD&amp;D and thinking it was odd that clerics only got spells at 2nd level. Wizards stayed mostly the same, but the spells crept back to 1st level and then bonus spells.<br/><br/>Something I was thinking also while reading through Player's Option: Spells &amp; Magic and the situation with conditional magic is that the priest would become the focal point of the party - only providing healing and buffing spells if the party operated in line with the wishes of the deity. Legends &amp; Lore also made that explicit with some of the specialty priests, such as one of the Egyptian ones getting turn undead at 3 levels higher but losing all abilities if anyone in the party looted a dead body. This would make priests central to the party, and literally make them the leaders, if not necessarily the explicit one, they'd still have a ton of clout and would make them far more interesting. <br/><br/>Just out of curiosity, given the comments that not memorising healing spells was considered a faux pas - was the player who played a cleric the last person to say "not me" in a lot of gaming groups?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281369/#Comment_281369" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T18:31:04+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  6:31PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing that happened with clerics, even "battle clerics" in 3rd edition at least (I hardly played any 2nd edition), is that they'd spend their first couple actions casting buffs and then the rest of the fight casting Cure spells.

In 4e everyone's really liked playing leaders of various kinds, and it's actually the fighter that has become the "not me" class. In the case of the 4e fighter, I think that's because your role, although important, is very reactive rather than proactive, being oriented towards containing enemies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281429/#Comment_281429" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T08:58:45+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  8:58AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

Then clerics would be mindblowingly awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281446/#Comment_281446" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T10:44:33+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 10:44AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you're saying like a little mini-game in the vein of a netrunner in Cyberpunk?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281449/#Comment_281449" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T10:50:35+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 10:50AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some food for thought from the MMO community:  <a href="http://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/combat/healing-death/" rel="nofollow">A Guild Wars 2 designer talks about fixing the 'healer problem.'</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281456/#Comment_281456" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T11:19:58+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 11:19AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guild Wars 1 actually did a lot to make healers interesting, even in the face of healing itself not being very interesting: the game gave you lots of defensive spells that you could use to reduce damage before it came in, at a much better rate-of-return than healing damage afterward, if you could predict who was about to take a pounding and "pre-prot" them appropriately.<br/><br/>This still caused a problem, though, because healing was fairly demanding (you have to keep track of the team's little red bars *and* watch out for incoming threats before they strike *and* defend yourself as the enemy's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> target). Players spoke favorably of the tactics of playing a monk, but many found actually doing it to be a busy and frustrating experience.
