As they used to say on alt.config, "I See A Great Need". <br/><br/>2 - There were 32 attendees total.  For a city of Tucson's size, that's fucking awesome.<br/><br/>3 - My favorite topics were:<br/><br/> Berin's "Worldbuilding 101", in which he identified the fundamental question of worldbuilding: Why?<br/><br/>and Thomas D's "Low Prep/No Prep" presentation, in which he showed how to use relationship maps to help figure out plot twists and opportunities.<br/><br/>But really, that's like "Steak or Lobster?!" The whole day was incredible.<br/><br/>4) Oh criminitly, YES, I learned tons of things, re-learned some things I hadn't thought about in a while...the most common reaction I heard from all the grinning, enthusiastic participants was along the lines of "Although I think I knew a lot of this stuff on some level, it really helps to have it boiled down, explained, and expanded on." And of course John Wick's stuff was great.<br/><br/>I should note that one of the purposes of this was to get lots of styles and lots of ideas together - not every single style or idea could be used by every single participant or group in every single moment. John devoted a nice big piece to in media res, and I have a player who just won't do that. She digs her heels in and simply refuses, that's how much she hates it.  So it's not a good technique for her. <br/><br/>The audience was lively and challenged the speakers, asked excellent open-ended questions and the discussions were wonderful and educational.<br/><br/>5) It was free, the venue was a local library meeting room, which was awesome and just barely held the number of people who attended.  If we expand at all, we will have to go somewhere else next time. <br/><br/>We did try to record the presentations...right now that audio's being processed, but we didn't really make recording it a big deal, so I'm guessing the quality of the audio's going to be highly variable. When it's in a postable format, I'll put up a URL.<br/><br/>Really, the fact that this was the very first Gamemaster's Conference in the history of the hobby is a disgrace to the hobby. Training, mentoring, developing partnerships, this is how you get better at everything else in the world, why not GMing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221094/#Comment_221094" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T07:42:47+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  7:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2009 7:43AM by Matthijs.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Really, the fact that this was the very first Gamemaster's Conference in the history of the hobby is a disgrace to the hobby.

I didn't hear anyone say "well that was pointless" or whatever.  The audience being very energetic and interactive was a big plus.  They could direct the speakers where they wanted to go.\n<blockquote>Did you know everybody who attended?  How did you publicize?  Who came the farthest?  What are these people running for their groups, in general?  What was the range of experience and play style?</blockquote>\nI didn't know everyone who attended, and some of the presenters I only knew as colleagues-in-gaming, like John and Dave.  We had people come from around 2-2.5 hours away in many directions (Bisbee, Phoenix).  I didn't do any kind of survey of the audience, we were running out of time, but the majority were <i>at least</i> D&amp;D GMs, from their questions.  I had more than one person say "You know, NPCs are so central to what everyone has been saying, but in a lot of our adventures we kinda have been skipping past them, this was great, it gave me some ideas for making them better."  Of course we had a strong World of Darkness contingent, including Jess Hartley, Dave Martin and others that accompanied them.<br/><br/>We publicized with flyers in our 2 gaming stores, the meetup group, and with me posting on various web forums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221197/#Comment_221197" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T14:15:49+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  2:15PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should add that the overwhelming size and quality of the response leads me to believe that GMs <i>really want to have things like this, very badly.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221266/#Comment_221266" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T18:40:26+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  6:40PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your talking it up on Pulp Gamer made me wish I was going to be in the area.
