Part of the problem is that Nobilis is too big to have a single "core story" (the way D&amp;D has a core story of: "run into a dungeon, grab a lot of gold and magic, killing things as necessary; repeat", or DITV has a core story of: "Ride into town, learn about problems, judge problems, scratch heads at aftermath; repeat").  <br/><br/>As near as I can figure, [i]at the very simplest style of play[/i], the Imperator orders the Nobles to accomplish a trippy, whacked-out mission.  Once the Nobles come to grips with the conceptual underpinnings, they're directly opposed by one group (other Nobles, Exrcucians, Camorra) and maybe indirectly opposed by another group (Camorra, chancel-folk, bad magic).  Miraculous kung-fu is unleashed; the problem is usually solved obliquely.  Repeat.<br/><br/>But I'm not sure about that; I've never actually played it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I think the first thing I would wonder is what domains did your players choose? This might be an indicator of what they want to see in the game as it really is the most central part of character creation for Nobilis.

Here's the things I usually think of when I need plot for Nobilis.<br/><br/>1) Attack on Estate: To me, the Excrucian Flower Rite is to Nobilis what the Dungeon is to D&amp;D: it's not the only plot in town, but it's the most straightforward one that gets right into the game. You've got a situation that's, by definition, intimately tied to what one of the characters is all about, and provokes an immediate response, perpetrated by a villain that's all full of cool tricks, and so on. Whenever you think things are flagging, look at one of the PCs, and go "Your estate is in distress." Bam! Plot!<br/><br/>2) Attack on Chancel: Attacks on the chancel are nice because they remind people why the dramatically underloved Realm attribute is important, and the Chancel is connected to all the PCs, whereas each Estate is only connected to one. I prefer to make attacks on the chancel less direct violence, more manipulation of the chancelfolk. That said, there's nothing wrong with somebody randomly unleashing random Giant Monsters into the Locus and seeing how the PCs react. Plus, odds are pretty high that they took some Banes (EVERYONE seems to take Banes), and you should make them pay for those chancel points.<br/><br/>3) Politics: Usually, the PCs will, in the course of their other adventures, meet other Nobilis, and either become their friends or enemies. Use these relationships to complicate the lives of the PCs: friends ask favors, enemies offer challenges, acquaintances host parties, etc. Also, be sure to throw NPCS at them randomly in other adventures just to sow the seeds of this kind of plot later. Watch out for those parties, though.<br/><br/>4) Quest for the Imperator:  Your imperator asks you to do something, you do it. This can be a sensible and epic challenge, such as "Justify the price of your existence by saving 101 mortal lives in peril. Before the day is over", or, as other point out, something trippy and whacked out, like "I desire the sun and moon in a box. Before the day is over." Being an ineffable and complex being means never needing to explain the plot! Easy to use, although a bit arbitrary and heavy-handed if done it too much, which is why I prefer the other strategies.<br/><br/>5) Character Goals: It's conceivable your players may attempt something that isn't just a direct reaction to whatever you've thrown at them (see the above 4 strategies). Take this as a blessing and run with it. Put appropriately dramatic obstacles in their way. Follow up with the consequences of their more or less inevitable success. With these techniques at your disposal you cannot fail!<br/><br/>To be fair, these ideas don't actually help you with structure or anything fancy like that. Just throw the Powers of Reincorporation and Foreshadowing into the game as important NPCs and you'll be all set on that front.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140766/#Comment_140766" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T05:14:10+00:00" title="April 22, 2008  5:14AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Benhimself wrote: <i>"To me, the Excrucian Flower Rite is to Nobilis what the Dungeon is to D&amp;D;: it's not the only plot in town, but it's the most straightforward one that gets right into the game."</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThe possibilities for an Excrucian assault aren't limited to Flower Rites, mind you, although dealing with different Breakthroughs essentially is the "core story" in <i>Nobilis</i>.

And like any good story, you need to make it something that the players can't ignore, and as Nobles the PCs can fix in a second.  This is the hardest step. After that, the players generate all your content in meaningful ways.  Well, they give you the seeds anyway - like Johhny Storyseeds wandering across Creation.<br><br>Here are my steps of Nobilis campaign play:<br/><br/>1. Start with one cool thing the players can't ignore and the PCs can't solve instantly, and preferably giving them reasons to use miracles.<br/><br/>2. Prepare a giant list of blank Noble NPCs.<br/>2-a. Do not define estates.  Just stats.<br/>2-b. Have a list of unattached names.<br/>    Edit -- it's probably obvious, but I forgot to make explicit: use just these elements when making your NPCs. Once you have the estate (see Step 3), pick a name that sounds good and grab a set of stats, bam, NPC... probably with some gifts, anchors and handicaps that you wouldn't have thought of giving them to make them very idiosyncratic. If you need a mortal or spirit, just pick a name that fits, if you need one, and forget the stats.<br/><br/>3. Anytime the PCs take any action, especially miracles<br/>3-a. Ask yourself "Which Domain is this action interferring with?" And make a note of it. It's perfectly okay if the biggest domain it effects is one of the players', and if that's true make a note of it, but try to think of a foreign Domain as well.<br/>3-b. Ask yourself "Does the story need more direct opposition or more intrigue?"  <br/>3-b-i. If it needs more direct opposition, then take the Domain from 3-a, apply it to an NPC and figure out how they are pissed off by the action, and introduce them soon as angry Nobles answer calls of distress to their Domain. They may or may not bring along their Chancel-mates.<br/>3-b-ii. If it needs more intrigue, take the Domain from 3-a and apply it to an NPC, and figure out how they are pleased by the action. Introduce them soon as a friendly Noble, pleased by the action the PC took and interested in trying to strike up an alliance for some plot of theirs.<br/>3-b-iii. If the story does <i>not</i> need more opposition or intrigue, then set the Domain note aside as a possible story hook for your <i>next</i> story. Call this list Domain Seeds or something.<br/><br/>4. Continue along until a resolution to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> occurs.<br/><br/>5. Plan for your next story by looking over your Domain Seeds. Which events resonated the most with your players? Build your next story around any or all of these things. You can tie them to anchors, have the Nobilis of the Estate(s) in question striking back, an Excrucian might be involved (especially if your players' domains are on the list - tie the Excrucian attack to reflect the nature of the miracle that inspired your note), a spirit that has been effected, the Imperator demands something related to it, and a variety of other hooks.  I concentrate on the first two, but the others are good for variety, and it depends on the nature of the campaign you want. The way I see it, the first is personal, the second is political, the third is spiritual and reflects the larger setting war, the fourth is social and metaphysical, the fifth is metaphysical and metaphorical, and the last leaves room to fill in any other gaps.<br/><br/>6 Brainstorming step 5 will give you several cool things tied into at least one of the characters without a whole lot of effort. Figure out something you like, go to step 1.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140844/#Comment_140844" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T14:40:50+00:00" title="April 22, 2008  2:40PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys rule.<br/><br/>And man especially Alvin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140856/#Comment_140856" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T17:35:32+00:00" title="April 22, 2008  5:35PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One idea I just remembered that I had a while back: Get a big pile of index cards. Tear them in half or something, because you'll probably need more.<br/><br/>For each point in Domain and point of bonds in "sanctity of my estate" or the like, write the PC's estate on a card. For each point of realm, or point of bond in "chancel", write the name of the chancel on their estate. Write out all the other bonds on a number of index cards equal to their bond strength, making sure each anchor has at least one card.<br/><br/>Now, whenever your spiritual-intuitive insight as an HG compels you to do so, draw a card, and threaten whatever is on that card in some way. Option: If they have 'Imperator' as a bond, instead of threatening it when one of those cards is drawn, have the Imperator come up with something they want the PCs to accomplish, regardless of what they're attending to at the moment. Bonus option: Draw two (or more) cards, and put those two (or more) things in conflict with each-other somehow.<br/><br/>And let the PCs <i>know</i> that you'll be using their bonds as a emergency "oracle", too, so they can choose them appropriately (someone who wants to do a lot of defending their estate plot despite being a Pawn can beef up Sanctity of their estate, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140888/#Comment_140888" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T02:58:16+00:00" title="April 23, 2008  2:58AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2008 2:58AM by GrimGent.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Incidentally, elsewhere I've recently mentioned the possibility of finding inspiration for actual play in the <i>flores</i>, the sidebar fiction. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showpost.php?p=200374&amp;postcount=30" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the link, for the sake of reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also suggest that it might help not to think of <i>Nobilis</i> as some sort of an ultimate sandbox game in which nothing ever happens unless the PCs first boldly take the initiative. The power scale may make that kind of freedom tempting, but it's no more required than it would be with any of the slightly more traditional RPGs, and the "be and do anything, anywhere, anytime" approach <i>will</i> leave at least some players thoroughly confused, paralyzed by the plethora of choices which in the end have no meaning.

Investigation in the style of <i>Sapphire &amp; Steel</i> has played a major part in my own games, for instance, so often knowing the most necessary answers well in advance is even vital for the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140947/#Comment_140947" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T10:15:32+00:00" title="April 23, 2008 10:15AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2008 10:17AM by Brand_Robins.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alvin's advice is golden. It works, in my mind, specifically well with everything I'm about to say. <br><br>For me, and this is just me and so I'm not putting it out as "how you MUST play Nobilis..." the truth is I've found that anytime I try to make a "plot" the whole game goes to shit in rapid order. <br/><br/>What works is having other NPCs who have a good reason to work with the PCs and a good reason to oppose them. What works is having constant low level challenges, pushes, and frustrations that build into more major confrontations when the PCs push back. What works is letting the meaning of the game, the "structure" come from what the PCs chose and push on. The Dogs mantra of "oh yea, what about now? Now? NOW?" works wonders. <br/><br/>Nobilis doesn't work well, IME, with focused, driven, or plot oriented play. It works very well as a game of slowly building cliques, rivalries, petty jealousy building to hate and murder, and a constant careful dance of human pettiness staged in a setting where the characters all have very little to gain and literally a universe to lose. <br/><br/>Worth noting, in all of this, that Excrucians are exactly like other NPCs. They don't exist to be big bads, they just exist as a more morally (but not inherently personally) opposed type of slowly building personal rivalry.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140954/#Comment_140954" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T10:39:17+00:00" title="April 23, 2008 10:39AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I just dug this up, from my old notes. It was the method I used to track how badly things were going in the game, and to give some mechanical focus to issues going on in play. <br/><br/>For any given NPC they have a list of rivalries or issues, rated from say 1 to 10. <br/><br/>In a conflict, the rating is how many MPs they are willing to spend in order to win a critical conflict about that issue. (Halve it for lesser conflicts about the issue, and quarter it for petty conflicts.) So once you get past an 8, the opponent is usually going to be willing to drop a Word in order to beat you. Also, once you get past a 5 (or once you get past the number of Mps they have to spend) they will be willing to spend other resources to get at you \u2013 like killing off their own anchors, harming their own estates, and so forth, as long as it hurts you more. At 10 they may well be willing to destroy everything they have, so long as it destroys you too.  <br/><br/>Most rivalries start off fairly low, like 1 or 2. <br/><br/>Any time you taunt, give offence, or otherwise socially thumb your nose at an opponent, it may go up by 1. (Alivn's 3-b-i could be at this level, or the next level down.) <br/><br/>Any time you take something minor, do a minor nettle rite, or cause inconvenience to an opponent, it will go up by 1 and may go up by 2.  <br/><br/>Any time you seriously fuck with a goal, social status, anchor, or chancel of an opponent it will go up by 2 and may go up by 3. <br/><br/>Any time you fuck with an estate, kill an anchor, harm a chancel, stop an imperator imposed duty, or cause a major social humiliation it will go up by 3 and may go up by 4. <br/><br/>Any time you totally fuck up a Nobles life, it will go up by 4 and may go up by 5. <br/><br/>Once it hits 10 the opponent is totally willing to work with Excrucians to fuck you over. A rivalry at this level is likely to become the focus of the game for a time, as it represents a hatred to the point that it will break down the entire social order around it and cause massive chaos and disruption. <br/><br/>Also, any time you make amends, restore something that went wrong, or do a favour (not for a favour in return) you may lower the rivalry by 1 or 2 points. If it turns out this was part of a political play, the good will be undone and it may count as another 1 point on top. <br/><br/>There could also be a different track, for alliance strength, where you get similar points to determine how much an NPC is willing to spend to help you. The two tracks can run separate (sometimes you closest ally might hate you the most), but maybe points from one can be used to negate points from the other \u2013 depending on what happens in the fiction. (This could work with Alvin's 3-b-ii)<br/><br/>(Note, I never did use the alliance track. I probably should have.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140964/#Comment_140964" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T12:11:27+00:00" title="April 23, 2008 12:11PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy guacamole. You guys are the greatest.<br/><br/>Honestly, I've been running the game a lot like you describe Brand. I come up with a grabby situation (the first situation was that their chancel's landlord was dying and they needed to pick a replacement) and just came up with a bunch of bane-based complications. Currently they're involved in a big factionalized struggle between followers of the Light Code who want to make the Weirding Wall impermeable and followers of the Wild Code who think that's a bad idea for a lot of reasons (they're followers of the Wild Code with a Wild Imperator).<br/><br/>It's going to be a good situation to set the stage for Rivalries and whatnot.<br/><br/>Your Alliance/Rivalry track is AWESOME.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140990/#Comment_140990" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T17:41:37+00:00" title="April 23, 2008  5:41PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand, that rivalry track is kick ass. It works not just for how much they'll throw at you, but also as a great guide for which NPCs the players find most compelling.<br/><br/>For more code rivalry, perhaps you could have codes indicate the starting level.  Direct, non-specific opposition puts the rivalry at a +1 when the NPC is introduced (yeah, some codes won't have opposites, that's ok). And anything you do that works against some principle of their code gives the action a +1 for rivalries. Now, if you have the same code, or do something that supports their code, instead of a -1 to the rivalry modifier, it's a +1 to the Alliance track. So, if you keep messing with an NPC in a way that really benefits his code, he builds up something of a love-hate relationship towards your character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140992/#Comment_140992" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T18:25:05+00:00" title="April 23, 2008  6:25PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just on the off chance, does anyone have the Nobilis character, chancel, and imperator sheets? <br/><br/>I can't find them anywhere on line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141047/#Comment_141047" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T06:45:26+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  6:45AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Found them!
