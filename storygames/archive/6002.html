What I am very interested in is seeing what people like us (slaves to constant online gaming discussion) do when we're not gaming.  Frex, I have friends that are hard core MMOers, hard core knitters, heavy into fitness, running marathons, book clubs, etc. Squint hard enough, and this thread looks exactly like the "Who Are You?" thread. In fact, it might just be that. But let's recap anyway, and focus on what you do, what you like to do, and other stuff about you.<br/><br/>To what other "activities" does your heart belong?<br/><br/>What are you other passions? What other activities have your time? What other "communities" (geek or otherwise) do you belong to?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134118/#Comment_134118" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T14:19:53+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  2:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2008 6:54AM by Andy.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me: <br/><br/>EDIT: The Fast Version:<br/>I learn about and participate in discussions of computer network storage systems and environments. Also into Japanese (lang), including reading manga/short stories, watching anime and J-Dramas. I've also become a yoga geek, reading, learning, and doing. My wife and I play video games, mostly PS2 puzzle and adventure games, and we're aiming to get a PS3 this year.<br/><br/>The Slow, Painful Version:<br/><br/><b>MENTAL</b><br/><br/>My Job is also my Love, of sorts: I troubleshoot and resolve deep issues for computer network storage, and storage servers. So I basically am a bucket filled with Windows, Linux, NAS and SAN, networking, databases, performance analysis, usability, standards and project control. I follow computer network storage blogs, news, and the like. I'm not much of a scripter or programmer, so I don't read up on the latest Windows/Linux stuff, I just solve problems as they come along.<br/><br/>I love thinking about personal productivity, and so when I'm not here I'm reading <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com" rel="nofollow">Lifehacker</a> and the like.<br/><br/>I read all sorts of Japanese stuff, namely manga and short stories and stuff. I'm pretty fluent. I used to watch lots of anime, but these days we watch more <a href="http://www.d-addicts.com" rel="nofollow">Japanese TV dramas</a> than anime. Online, I like to participate in Japanese discussion forums and the like.<br/><br/>I used to be a big fan of philosophy, but after sucking up most of the contemporary American Pragmatist movement stuff, I've not been interested in "pure philosophy" since.<br/><br/><b>PHYSICAL</b><br/><br/>I do yoga three times a week. I'm pretty hardcore into it.<br/><br/>I'm interested in fitness and nutrition, mostly because I'm trying to become fit and healthy again, so I go to various fitness classes, nutrition seminars, etc.<br/><br/>I'm still interested in martial arts, and follow some MA blogs and sites (bullshido, etc). But I don't practice these days (used to be TKD, Full Contact Karate, Aikido, Wing Chun Kung Fu for some 11 years total)<br/><br/>Not too much into sports at all.<br/><br/><b>SOCIAL</b><br/><br/>I used to be big into watching movies with friends, but there's been nothing good lately. I like to watch DVDs with friends, though.<br/><br/>I like going out to eat at a nice restaurant once every two weeks or so with my wife. We rate restaurants for our friends and family.<br/><br/>I'm into coffee and tea (lately I've been big into Yerba Mate, even have a metal straw and dumbass gourd and everything). I'd travel far (and have!) to buy or drink good tea.<br/>I don't like alcohol that much anymore (save Rum and Coke), but I'm a big fan of Sake. I'm not even a snob about Sake: I've got $60 bottles of Daiginjo (that would go for $250 in the US) lined up next to $10/bottle nigorizake-s. I've got a nose for it, and I know what I like, but try as I may I simply can't be all Wine-Snobby about it.<br/><br/>I like to hang out with friends. Turns out that most of my friends in the area are folks that I regularly game with. Huh.<br/><br/>I love dance music, and even used to be a techno DJ, though I haven't been clubbing in years.<br/><br/><b>SPIRITUAL</b><br/><br/>I dig reading Buddhist texts (longtime fave is the Kongoh/Diamond Sutra).<br/><br/>How about you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134121/#Comment_134121" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T14:26:47+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  2:26PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kill people with my mind!<br/><br/>These days I go to university where I study Sociology and Philosophy, and then go to sleep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134127/#Comment_134127" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T14:34:26+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  2:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I do lots of other stuff.<br/><br/>Like, I love mountain biking. I'm not saying I'm any good at it. I fall off a lot, but it's fun. Especially here in Wellington, where there are trails practically just outside my door. And since getting to NZ, I've built up a rather nice bike, which is <a href="http://velospace.org/node/6732" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In winter I enjoy snowboarding, which I've been doing for over a decade now and am still incapable of a 360. Shame upon me.<br/><br/>Oh, and since arriving in NZ, I've found out the joys of playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_%28sport%29" rel="nofollow">Ultimate</a>, with 5 a side on Tuesdays and 7 a side on Thursdays. It's great fun. And, I'll be bringing a disc to Gen Con with the determination to get some folks outside for a throw around.<br/><br/>Brain wise, I'm in the midst of writing an MA thesis proposal so I can go back to university after all these years and do some post-grad research stuff. It's history, by the way. Even though my degree is actually history &amp; sociology. You may be surprised to learn that I have an interest in Cold War history. Who would have thought? I would talk about stuff I'm reading right now, but it's all hardcore history stuff like documentation from 1951 and all that. <br/><br/>Like Andy, I also used to DJ, although mine was for an alternative/metal/punk club that a friend and I ran for four years. Was great fun though, very fond memories of that. I like going out, dancing is fun.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134128/#Comment_134128" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T14:34:26+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  2:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On Saturdays, I get semi-drunk, then swing-dance &amp; tap-dance to industrial music (and occasionally Johnny Cash) at a goth nightclub.<br/><br/>(Not a joke).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134131/#Comment_134131" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T14:37:34+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  2:37PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2008 3:33PM by Ry.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I work for a bank, I'm a dad and a husband.

That said...<br/><br/>Professional<br/>- I've done study of emerging legal issues surrounding virtual worlds and how American law is eventually going to have to address problems already faced by Chinese and South Korean courts.  It remains a subject of great interest to me.<br/>- I currently do research on American courts and the influence of political interest groups on those courts.<br/><br/>Media<br/>- I really love science fiction.  A lot.  In particular I'm a big Star Trek fan, but more in a watching and loving the shows sort of way than identifying myself as a Trekkie.<br/>- I enjoy reading comics, but I'm very choosey and only purchase TPB collections.  Fables and Invincible are two of my ongoing favorites, with Transmetropolitan being one of my all time favorites.<br/><br/>Games<br/>- I like turn based strategy games but I find them too addictive to play.  I recently reinstalled Alpha Centauri and lost an entire evening to it before uninstalling it again.<br/>- I enjoy MMOs.  I don't consider myself a casual fan, having played them quite a bit over the last 10 years, but I don't have the time or desire to be hardcore either.  I'll usually have 1 or 2 max level characters for most MMOs I play, with some end game content done.  I primarily enjoy playing them with a small group of friends that are 'the MMO playing group'.<br/>- I have a real love for CCGs, especially Magic: The Gathering.  However, I have no one to play with.  I always liked playing them casually before RPG sessions and the like, but no one I know still plays CCGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134136/#Comment_134136" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T14:45:52+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  2:45PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, my job is laid back and interesting.

It's what I used to do professionally and I really like it.  I'm talking about Web accessibility at a regional conference tomorrow.<br/><br/>I love paddling - just reluctantly sold my pair of touring kayaks and will replace them with a pair of solo canoes this spring.  Which is an open invitation to go paddling if you live near me and we have any water left when you ask.<br/><br/>My wife and I bought a house five months ago, so that's consuming a ton of time and energy, in a very pleasant way.

Also, they let me paint minis on breaks. w00t! <br/><br/>I read and collect old detective fiction and original pulp fiction. For instance, I picked up an original hardcover printing of The Weird Adventures of The Shadow in excellent condition. I am currently defiling it on lunch breaks at the aforementioned job. <br/><br/>I watch a lot of movies while I do chores around the apartment. Bad stuff, usually.

Occasionally, I make room for redeeming cinema like <i>No Country for Old Men</i>. <br/><br/>Once or twice a week, I go out to dinner at local greasy spoon eateries with a small group of friends.

(Seriously, I know way too much about bovine STDs now.)<br/><br/>Like Malcolm &amp; Andy, I used to be a DJ.  Not at a club, but at college radio as one of the top electronica spinners.  (I really enjoyed having a show that was when the head of that music department was cataloging his adds.  He would come in and just hand me new stuff to play right away, before anyone else got it.)<br/><br/>I am a big ol' Stargate nerd.<br/><br/>I used to do this thing called a Drunken Chess Tournament, where a friend and I sought the world (well, Sacramento) for the greatest drunken chessmaster.  But that event  isn't nearly as fun to organize anymore, so I haven't held one in years.  But I would totally love to get a huge group of SGers together for something like that.  (Would have to be at least 16 for a decent single-elimination tournament in an afternoon.)  As a result of playing chess for years drunk, I'm actually pretty cool compared to someone else at the same level of intoxication.<br/><br/>Most of my friends are gamer nerds of one sort of the other.  Come to think of it, I haven't spent a lot of time lately trying to meet new people locally -- I've been pretty busy.<br/><br/>Mental-wise, I was going after a Journalism degree for a little bit, but I don't have the time for it right now.  Physical-wise, I used to do weight training until being crippled started making it something I couldn't keep up with.  I used to have quite a bit of back strength (from carrying several GURPS books in my backpack every day for years and walking a mile minimum to work), but a lot of that has been lost over the last year.  I don't usually blog about it, but I've had a lot of hard days lately.<br/><br/>That's a shitty note to end things on.  Uh...I crush all humans!  That, and if it's a Vertigo comic, I'm probably a fan of it (or would be if exposed to it).  If I had a single dream, it'd be to be a comic book writer.  IF I had the funds, I'd pay an artist to drawn my most recent vision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134145/#Comment_134145" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T15:20:09+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  3:20PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Work<br/>- I'm a software engineer at Microsoft, in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">Mac Business Unit</a>. I like programming in general, creating and understanding complex abstract systems to accomplish some useful task, and particularly programming in Objective-C using the Cocoa frameworks on the Mac. About a third of my subscribed feeds are Mac-program-y feeds.<br/><br/>Fun<br/>- I like going for walks in neat places outdoors, especially around mountains. I have literally walked over a [small] mountain range just to see what was on the other side. There were forest crabs.<br/>- I'm an <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/doublefeh/" rel="nofollow">extremely amateur photographer</a>. When I go hiking in the mountains, I usually take a camera.

Anime and food were my entry vectors, but in recent years, they've just been individual aspects among many. <a href="http://int.kateigaho.com/" rel="nofollow">Kateigaho International Edition</a> is the only print magazine I regularly read. I enjoy temple-hopping in Kyoto in part just to geek over the artistic and aesthetic differences between Zen temples and Pure Land temples, etc. <br/>- I think I have enough Japanese woodblock prints at this point to call myself a Collector. My wife and I came back from our honeymoon with something like $800 worth of art, which is actually a decent quantity for wood-block prints. Mostly contemporary artists. Every so often I spend an afternoon browsing gallery pages and wishing I had a few thousand spare bucks lying around to get some real classics.<br/>- I'm into music, especially classical (meaning all the way from classical through romanticism to modern). Other stuff, too, but classical is what I've devoted the most energy to. I have at least four recordings of Beethoven's 9th symphony, and, the first time I heard it, accurately placed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_vlast" rel="nofollow">Ma Vlast</a> as being Eastern European Romantic Nationalism within about three minutes.<br/><br/>Other<br/>- I'm a fan of good beer, single-malt scotch, and dessert wines. I like sake, but it never seems to be as good when I'm not in Japan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134149/#Comment_134149" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T15:34:26+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  3:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get paid real money to research and write about interesting stuff happening in other parts of the world, since I work for a tiny foreign policy think-tank.

I've applied to graduate school in Anthropology and Sociology, but I'm not sure whether or where I'm going next year.<br/><br/>I'm in a new band with my friends John and Mel.

I produced and/or designed the last three Diner Dash games and feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to help build such a successful franchise.  But I find myself more drawn to online experiences rather than single player.  I enjoy building communities and bringing people together, not just with games.<br/><br/>Up until recently I was taking the ferry to work from Alameda to SF, and it was bliss compared to just about every other type of commuting I've done.  Being on the water just feels good.<br/><br/><b>Fun and Food</b><br/><br/>I love putting the top down on a nice day and driving my Miata on curvy canyon roads with no one else around.<br/><br/>I like to explore new places with my wife.  Which usually involves said convertible.  We've seen about everything within an hour of the Bay Area, and we are widening our search this year.<br/><br/>The outdoors are like oxygen for me after working in an office all week.  One of my favorite things to do is take a walk on a rustic trail through a forest of tall trees next to a river.  It reminds me of growing up in Missouri and the beautiful walks I had there.  I've been to the coast enough times to know that it's fun, but it doesn't affect my soul the way a river flowing by does.<br/><br/>I love BBQ and all things meat.  I recently got a Weber Bullet Smoker, and have been smoking salmon, ribs, chicken, pork shoulder, you name it.  And since I live near Berkeley, I'll also put a veggie burger on the grill for your vegan ass.<br/><br/>I like my alcohol to be quality rather than quantity.  So the beer is all Newcastle, and the liquor cabinet is stocked with Belizean rum, Russian vodka, French armagnac, and some honey mead made from bees my friends keep.<br/><br/>I really enjoy coffee, but have drastically reduced my caffeine consumption the past few years.  So I get the best estate-grown decaf coffee I can find.  And if I am in your city I will hunt down the best espresso there is to offer. <br/><br/><b>Media</b><br/><br/>I'm not much of a TV watcher.  I turn on the TV, and if nothing interesting in on Speed Channel, VH1 or Turner Movie Classics...it usually gets turned off.<br/><br/>I do love a good old movie.  Especially film noir.  I bet I've watched 60-70 of those suckers in the past year or two.<br/><br/>My wife and I don't watch much TV together, but we have gone through three seasons of Alias, which I think was brilliant television.  We are about 3/4 of the way through Firefly, because I was tired of not getting all of the references from my gamer friends.  But I am not as enthused about that show as others seem to be.<br/><br/>I got rid of all my old games systems and just have a Wii and a DS.  The virtual console on the Wii is brilliant and I don't mind paying $5-10 for old-school games.  The DS is great for hanging out and mass-transit.<br/><br/>I do a lot of reading, although my time is limited as compared to 10-15 years ago.  I have quite a collection of 19th century fiction by French authors, mostly Dumas and Balzac.  I picked up a number of printed volumes from the 1888-1912 era and have help onto them. I like to read military history and European history, especially the Mediterranean.  <br/><br/>Since I like driving fast you'll also see some books on race driving and historical cars on my shelf.<br/><br/>Currently I think I subscribe to: The Economist, Motorsport, The London Review of Books, Sunset and Foreign Affairs.<br/><br/>Other magazines I read at the old-ass Mechanics Institute Library I belong to in SF.  The patrons there are older than the tobacco-colored leather chairs.<br/><br/>Music tends towards 70-80s rock (Rush anyone?), 90s hip-hop and 50-60s cool jazz.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/coffeestain" title="coffeestain"><img alt="coffeestain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/coffeestain">coffeestain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134159/#Comment_134159" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T16:03:04+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  4:03PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I work at an <a href="http://www.veterinaryemergencyservice.com/" rel="nofollow">emergency veterinary clinic</a> as an assistant, working toward becoming a veterinary technician.  I took the job on a whim (along with a huge pay cut) after working for a number of years in telecommunications.  It was one of the best moves I ever made.<br/><br/>Recreationally, I enjoy playing other sorts of games apart from RPGs.  I've got an Xbox 360 and make pretty good use of that.  I also play some miniature wargames such as <a href="http://www.confrontation.fr" rel="nofollow">Confrontation</a>  &amp; <a href="http://songofblades.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Song of Blades and Heroes</a> (a really cool indie wargame).

It's professionally rewarding and very challenging and important work, but I like to leave it at work for reasons that should be obvious.

It runs the gamut. I make a dinky little PDF presentation one day, then the next I do graphics that cover every video projection device in Times Square for 24 hours. My boss is awesome and super supportive of my creative projects so I only work three days a week. It's amazing what you can get for the asking sometimes.<br/><br/><b>I teach Aikido</b> for some friends in a little dojo space in my home. It's one of the most satisfying and rewarding things that I do. Right now it's only one day a week and I wish it was a lot more. There is a bottomless well of discovery to be had in the simple actions of shifting balance, leading, following, falling down, getting up again. In the distant past, I trained in Wing Chun and Kendo, which were both great and shredded lots of skin from various surfaces.<br/><b><br/>I appreciate a fine whiskey</b>. Usually bourbon. I'm no snob, but I try to treat myself to something really nice every now and then. I love the craftsmanship and care behind a really fine alcohol. Same goes for espresso.<br/><br/><b>I watch TV with my girlfriend</b>. Kind of a lot, really. We both love the stuff and have pretty similar tastes, although my recent descent into Stargate Atlantis has been solo. The Shield, Lost, BSG, Project Runway, Avatar, Nova, and (recently) Terminator are faves. We also watch CSI: Miami because we love to make fun of it and yell at the characters -- it's our own personal MST3K.<br/><b><br/>I play Xbox</b> almost every night. I don't go for immersion in my roleplaying, but I do in my videogames. I love getting lost in a video game world for a while. The Half-Life 2 series and Bioshock have delivered in spades lately, as well as the visceral crash and bang of Rainbow Six Vegas multiplayer. I played WoW religiously for six months, which I think back on as if it was a place I used to live and moved away from. Fond memories. Champions Online is going to get me, for sure.<br/><br/><b>I design video games</b> in my head and play them while I'm falling asleep. I know I'm not the only one. The latest one (a kind of open-world mashup between Splinter Cell, Fable 2, and GTA III -- in the universe of <i>Altered Carbon</i>) is particularly great. I'd beam it into your head if I could.<br/><br/><b>I play poker</b>. I'm in a little circle of players who love to study games on TV, read poker books, talk theory, and actually get together and play semi-regularly. Through work, I've had a few phone conversations with Annie Duke, which was such a thrill. We talked about her awesome lay-down of kings against Raymer and I just geeked the hell out. Like martial arts, the game just has no bottom. You can always learn something new and improve your skills, forever.<br/><br/>Holy crap this is long! Too long, really.

I play some casual online games, but I get too addicted to computer games.  My wife and I watch a lot of tv and movies.  Like, we download something like 3Og a week.  Currently we've just finished Veronica Mars, working through the last of The Wire, and we just watched Darjeeling Limited (Wes Anderson always makes the same damn movie.  It's a good movie, but it's the same one every time.  Also, apparently, India is where spirituality comes from).<br/><br/>Oh, I'm also learning to draw.

Corny but true. I love to cook, especially throwing over-the-top parties (like my Oscar party) and turning out ridiculously gourmet meals, e.g., eight-course degustation menus out of the Charlie Trotter mold. I like to read fantasy novels and thrillers, especially Bond and John Rain. I like to go to the movies whenever I can -- which isn't too often these days.

A recomendation, for anyone ( and for any player, or creator, of Shock:, specially ): Alfred Bester\xb4s "Demolished Man" it\xb4s the best thing i read in a long while. I used to draw and write short stories, and in both areas i became "average" instead of just "bad", but nowadays i just don\xb4t.<br/>What i do is listening to a lot of music, which depending on the mood might be from Massive Attack to The Skatalites to Emiliana Torrini to the Ramones to many more.<br/><br/><br/>Geeking:<br/>Not much more than RPG playing ( finally a regular group is forming, though we keep testing game after game without staying long enough with any ) and discussing in many forums.

Although I haven't legally adopted my step-daughter (from what we've been told, the court costs are such that I can't afford it right now), I've adopted her in my heart, and more importantly, she's adopted me--she calls me "Dad" and won't even joke about anyone being her dad but me. We were playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance tonight before she went to bed, and she cracks me up. "All we have to do is get the M'Kraan Crystal and face Galactus. *sarcastically* Oh, that should be easy. Come on!" (that last bit said like G.O.B. on "Arrested Development"). She's 11, by the way. I'm also a husband, which is equally important, but in a different way (obviously).<br><br>I'm a librarian by profession, and it's something I care very deeply about. I'm active in the online "biblioblogosphere" community of library folk (and if you think gamers are geeky, man, you should meet librarians--some of whom are also gamers), I present at conferences, and I think about library issues a lot. Last year, as sort of a lark, I helped start an anarchic, grassroots "alternative" to the huge, bureaucratic American Librarian Association, called the Library Society of the World, and it's surprisingly taken off. Not in that it's a serious rival to the ALA (or even smaller, state library associations), but in that there is now an active group of people who have become professional and personal comrades, using blogs, wikis, IM, Twitter, forums, and other social software to foster support and development.<br><br>My current job is in web content, so I'm working to improve my web coding and design skills. Mostly this means dicking around a bit with javascript and Ruby on Rails, without really learning much, while also building up my HTML and CSS skills. I really would like to learn more coding, though, since a lot of my interests in terms of libraries is in building better, more social web platforms. (<a href="http://www.librarything.com/" rel="nofollow">LibraryThing</a> is one of my favorite sites, and in many ways a better site than most actual library websites.) I'm particularly interested in developing platforms and content for children and teens, which is what my current job focuses on.<br><br>Beyond that, I read a lot of old superhero comics, I read novels (although I'm a very easily distracted reader)--mostly SF and fantasy, but not entirely--and read reprints of old pulp magazines. I watch a lot of movies and TV show DVDs, I listen to music (mostly late '70s/'80s postpunk, with some jazz and other stuff thrown in for good measure), and since we recently got a PS2, I play video games. My wife (who is an amazing cook and baker) has encouraged me to stretch my cooking wings, so I've been learning new recipes (although I prefer cooking solid comfort food, and haven't really tried any gourmet cooking). And I spend a lot of time online, being very interested in the internet and social networking. (Except I've never played RPGs online. Doesn't really interest me. I like the in-person experience of RPGs.)<br><br>Oh, and I used to write (and sometimes perform) poetry and write some fiction, but I haven't written much of anything (beyond blog posts) in quite a while.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134247/#Comment_134247" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T21:15:43+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  9:15PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2008 9:16PM by E.T.Smith.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate these kinds of discussions.

For european standards, I am way too much into junkfood, for american standards, my diet is not exactly healthy. Working at a company where food is important is way cool. Lately, I have developed a fondness for fruit I have forgotten about. A day without fruit is a day wasted. Which might explain my involvement with Apple computers (Hi Albert!).<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Drink</i><br/>\nI'm into freshly pressed fruit juice, smoothies, espresso macchiato, tap water (which is better than most bottled water in Switzerland). On the unhealthy side of drinking: I don't do beer, wine or champagne. Some people mistakenly assume I am not into alcohol. I am into Vodkas, Tequilas, Rums and cocktails (no whiskey). I am a responsible drinker.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Sleep</i><br/>\nI usually go to bed late and sleep no more than 6 hours. My favorite mattress is quite hard \u2013 if they're too soft, I get shoulder ache. I usually dream in colorful scenes, with dialogues read voice over, and little ambient sound.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>I should spend more time</i><br/>\nsalsa dancing. I do it for twelve years, but I've forgotten more than I remember. If I work on it a bit, a lot of stuff comes back to me. I will start classes for co-workers soon.<br/>\nsailing. It's a great sports activity. I love water and wind, and asking them to be put somewhere else is a great way to clear up your mind.<br/>\ntaking spanish lessons. It's a nice language, and a lot of people speak it. Also, see my passion for salsa.<br/>\naway from the computer.

I'll go snowboarding for the first time in my life in two weeks \u2013 I'm really looking forward to it. I know I'll fall alot in the beginning.<br/>\nlearn more about my job, and meet even more interesting people than I alread did.<br/>\npublish a game.

There are plans to get me my own stand at a local market here in Vienna some time in April, so we'll see how that turns out.<br><br/><b>Recreation</b><br/>Like some others here, I live at least large parts of my life over the internet. I'm neophile, constantly looking for the new in various forums, blogs like BoingBoing or Lifehacker and so on. I'm also hooked up on many webcomics, most notably Something Positive, Sinfest, Diesel Sweeties, Joe Loves Crappy Movies, Penny Arcade and Devils Panties.<br/><br/>I'm still interested in art, though my actual output has suffered greatly the last couple of years. The one thing I did recently was these series of faces/characters/eyes on index cards that I collected in packages, Hipster PDA-Style. Might do more of those, they nicely fit into my lifestyle at the moment. (Meaning I can do them in a couple of minutes whenever I feel like it, like between or during websurfing or on the train.) Yesterday I was in an Exhibition in the Mumok about Mathematics in Art with my girlfriend and a friend, first exhibition we managed to go to in years, but it was pretty interesting. They had some really cool stuff there. (Whether modern like the Fibonacci Sequence in blue neon letters or old like beautiful ink sketches from 16-something.)<br/><br/>I have a notebook-and-pen fetish. Ok, it's not a fetish as there's nothing sexual about it, so it's more like a compulsion, maybe. I LOOOOOVE beautiful notebooks and when I see one I have to fight hard not to buy it immediately. I have dozens of notebooks at home, most of them completely unused or only partially used. The more I like a notebook, the less likely it is to actually see use, simply because they are so cool I can't think of anything "appropriately cool enough" to put into them. It's similar with pens, although here my appreciation is sightly more functional. I love writing instruments, especially ones that are well-made and use real ink. Fineliners and ballpoints are ok for quick notes now and then, but a real fountain pen or even better a nice bottle of ink and a metal pen, THOSE are the real things. So together with my dozens of notebooks, I also have dozens of pens (Both metal and glass.), fountain pens and ink bottles at home.<br/><br/>I don't drink much alcohol, but I really like some alcoholic drinks, but only for the taste. (I have been drunk exactly once in my life.) For example, I hate the way beer tastes, but I love spiced wine or mead. I like cocktails especially ones that are either fruity or creamy. Where other people drink socially, I smoke weed with my friends. But even there, this is pretty much "3 joints a month" or something like that. After my heavy pothead phase in school, I quit completely for a while and even now try to keep it down a bit.<br/><br/>I love playing computer games and have done so pretty much as long as I remember. Got that from my father, I think. I remember how we got a Commodore 64 and played Giana Sisters for hours. Nowadays, it'd mostly games on the PC, even though I have a PS2 at home. My current fix is Team Fortress 2 and Battlefield 2142 before it suddenly stopped working on my notebook. (Fuck you, EA.) A couple of months ago, I started playing my first MMO: EVE Online and so far have played it casually but steadily. (I've tried other games before, like WoW and FFXI, but they never did anything for me.) I'm thinking about getting the new Call of Duty to replace Battlefield for my "gritty, tactical shooter", but have been burned in the past and so I'm waiting till somebody I know get it or it gets significantly cheaper.<br/><br/>I read lots of books. Often, I read two or three at the same time and they never last long enough. Recently, my book habit has been too costly, because I can't afford to spend 15-20 Euros on a book two times a week. I really should get myself a library membership, but until I do, I'm keeping myself happy with free/open books from the internet (Just read "Butcher Bird" by Richard Kadrey and now I want to run Nobilis.) and cheap books bought used. (I just got "The Confusion" by Neil Stephenson and "The God Delusion" by Richard Dawkins that way.) Reading gaming books also helps.<br/><br/>The same goes for comics, really. I really dig lots of comics.<br/><br/>I had a short flirt with LARPing, even got a bunch of friends and acquaintances together to act as a mercenary guild (We even designed and built a cool banner.), but got dissatisfied with the local LARP scene really fast. In the back of my head and spread over various forum posts, there is my design for a "Larp to solve what's wrong with Larps" but actually get that done would be too much work and would mean that I had to organize it. Which doesn't help when I want to play it.<br/><br/><b>Social</b><br/>As others here are defined by being a husband or father, I think I define myself as a "boyfriend". I've been with my gf for six years and we have been friends and best friends for years before that, so we do feel like we're married sometimes. Most of my time, I spend with her or at least at her place. Sometimes we just sit in the same room, each doing our own stuff and thats great too.<br/><br/>My idea of a nice evening is visiting one (or a couple) of my friends, making good food and watching TV, DVDs or just talking. I don't have many friends, but most of them are really, really good friends. Like, "I feel somewhat adopted by them and their family"-type friends. Sometimes we go see a movie together or meet in Vienna to get some food somewhere, but the best is just visiting them (Or having them visit us) and just hide in their warm cave and feast well.<br/><br/><b>Exercise:</b><br/><br/>...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>um... does sex count?</blockquote>\nOh, wait, I do another thing now and then: Archery. Nothing professional or anything, just me, a couple of friends and our longbows. (One of my friends even builds his own. They are strong and scary.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax" title="BastardToadflax"><img alt="BastardToadflax" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax">BastardToadflax</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134301/#Comment_134301" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T07:08:12+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  7:08AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I don't post here much, but I'll chime in too. I'm a dad first and foremost, but I also do maritime law, which is fun, because I get to go out to tankers and large cargo ships in Portland Harbor, Maine, to practice law.  On the other hand, these ships don't have enough problems--which is a good thing--to generate full time work, so I practice in a bunch of other areas I'm not so excited about.  I studied geology and like reading about science and the environment and published a paper not too long ago about streamflow regulation in Maine. I'm reading about parasites now, in Carl Zimmer's excellent Parasite Rex.  I practice yoga every morning, suffer from chronic fatigue, and have lost 15 pounds in the last month, which was a feat.  I'm a huge fan of modern audio drama, shoot a recurve bow in the summer, and like to go sailing, paddling and just about anything else that involves playing in the ocean.  And I even get to play some of the games discussed here and written by many of you, for which I thank you all.

I'll be eligible to sit for the exam to become a RPSGT in about 6 months, but I will probably wait until December to take it. I love my job, but hopefully I won't be doing it 10 years. I'd rather be catching babies as a homebirth midwife, but while my kids are young, I like the steady income and regular hours. Regular hours for me are 7 pm to 7 am 3 days a week.<br/><br/>Speaking of kids, that's my other job. I'm a full time mom and family chick. I have a 3 year old and an 8 year old.  My husband works for a publishing company and is working on an MBA. We used to publish an arts 'zine about 5 years ago, when we had only one child.<br/><br/>I have a degree in Religion, and I'm a couple credits shy of a nursing degree. I probably won't go back to nursing school, but will do apprentice-based midwifery training when my kids are older.<br/><br/>HOBBIES and COMMUNITY<br/>I am an amateur herbalist. I make my own hair and body products, soap, medicinal teas and tinctures, and other herbal preparations. I have an interest in herbals for women. I used to sell my soap and body productsat the local farmer's market, but this year instead of running a booth, I'll be helping to organize special events at the market. One of them will be an rpg demo day. I live in Western Mass, where there are game designers every 100 feet or so.<br/><br/>In addition to herbals, I play with microbes and probiotics. In the spring I'm going to start making wildflower and herbal wine. My husband and I used to make beer. I brew <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha" rel="nofollow">kombucha</a> and give away SCOBY's for a small fee. Occasionally I make my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefir" rel="nofollow">kefir</a> and yogurt. I did a batch of ginger beer from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_beer" rel="nofollow">Ginger Beer Plant</a> that Vincent gave me, but I like making kombucha better.<br/><br/>I'm involved in our local tv and radio station, and do <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4647&amp;page=1#Item_21" rel="nofollow">TV show</a> that features local people doing their thing. I hope to start doing a radio show featuring British Isles and American folk music. I'm a folk music geek. I also play the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoharp" rel="nofollow">autoharp</a>. I currently pay a 21 chord chromatic <a href="http://www.timbreline.com/autoharp.html" rel="nofollow">Timbreharp</a>, but I have a couple of project harps. One is a child's autoharp, and the other sweet older Oscar Schmidt that I'm going to convert to a diatonic/"biatonic" 'harp that will play in F and C. <br/><br/>I'm also involved in an organization called <a href="http://www.motherwoman.org" rel="nofollow">MotherWoman</a> with Meg Baker. She does more stuff with it than I do, but she pulled me into the MotherWoman fold, much in the same way that she roped me into role playing games and design. <br/><br/>I'm a knitter, too. And a failed spinner. I used to do more SCA stuff, but haven't in a few years.<br/><br/>My husband and I do gardening, although it's really his thing. I minored in [plant] biology in college, so I have the plant knowledge, but my husband has the interest. I help dig and pick out plants, but he's the plant keeper and tender. I use a good amount of what people call weeds (burdock, nettles, chickweed, dandelions, etc.) for my herbals.<br/><br/>PHYSICAL<br/>I slacked off this winter, but I love to work out, bike, and dance. I've taken bellydancing off and on for the past 5 years. My husband and I used to be avid hikers when we had a dog and no kids. This summer I hope to get back into canoeing.<br/><br/>TOTALLY RANDOM BODY-RELATED HOBBIES<br/>I'm trying to see how long I can grow my hair. My goal is to get it to my knees. It's currently a couple inches past my butt. I started about 11 years ago with an inch or so of hair. I'm always on the lookout for cool dreadlock friendly hair accessories. <br/><br/>When I have larger chunks of spare cash, I visit my friendly neighborhood tattoo artist. Ignoring religious prohibitions (I just don't see why God would send me to hell for beautiful tattoos), I plan to have both arms tattooed a couple inches above my wrists (I'm about 25% done), my whole back, and both legs to just above the ankles. I have a few older tattoos to cover up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134328/#Comment_134328" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T08:49:02+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  8:49AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Work</b> <br/>I'm a system/network admin for the University of Virginia.  I used to run the central email service, but after 7 years and alot of burnout, I'm slowly moving into the networking side of things.  I program when I can, and occasionally get some project work done if the day to day problem stay dormant long enough.  I love Perl, want to love Ruby but haven't found the time, can play in Python and write C when forced.<br/><br/>I'm a Mac guy, having come to the party late, and not suffering through the non Unix years.   I've admined most forms of SysV unix you've ever seen an a couple defunct ones that are gone now.  Open source is my friend, but some of its zealots bother me, as do zealots of most types who want to staple their beliefs to me, with our without my consent.<br/><br/><b>Personal</b><br/>I'm married to a wonderful woman.  I have 2 kids.  My stepson turns 18 this year.  My little one just turned 7.  Both have their own unique problems that keep us busy.  My littlest one has a symptom of some sort, not aspergers, but something yet to be positively identified.<br/><br/>I used to do more with both the pagan and native american spirituality, but not recently.  My belief has been overtaxed by people with stupid drama games and power/status issues.<br/><br/><b>Recreation</b><br/>I play RPGs  as much as I can, and really like the "story now" games.  I run games at Cons as much as I can afford, and try hard to rope my friends into going to Cons with me.  I've been playing a bit too much Final Fantasy 12 on my PS2 lately.  We got a Wii last year and I am consistently impressed with what developers are doing to make games fun again on that platform.<br/><br/>and I turn forty this year, which is seems crazy to me...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134329/#Comment_134329" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T08:59:48+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  8:59AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>like *ahem* bacon vodka.</blockquote>\nDude!

In addition to my role-playing interests, I'm also an avid player of Eve Online and participate in that community as well. Otherwise, it seems computer games manage to hold less and less of my interest these days.<br/><br/>Two dear hobbies which have fallen by the wayside in recent years are tournament paintball and martial arts, both of which I'll be returning to in varying degrees when my situation changes from being a full-time student to full-time employed. They both embody the competitive spirit manifested in the physical realm, which I feel as an important drive, but they also contain that aspect of excellence wherein you attempt to triumph over yourself. That and (un)healthy doses of adrenaline.<br/><br/>On a more bookish note, I've devoured material on history, the martial arts, the occult and western/eastern philosophy/religion and continue to do so. Oh, and on role-playing of course. Self-improvement in the more modern sense also interests me.<br/><br/>To balance these sorts of things, I enjoy a thorough social life and take joy in the hedonistic, even superficial things one can find. I'm quite a drinker, a voracious flirt, a socialite and regular in the party/clubbing scene. Back in the days, I used to be involved in organizing electronic/techno music clubs, but of late I've distanced myself from the organizing and only dip in for my own enjoyment. Though some might, I do not see these sorts of interests to be in opposition to my other, perhaps more geek-ish pursuits. Instead, I like to think they round out the type of person I am.<br/><br/>Joachim Buchert                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134419/#Comment_134419" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T13:04:46+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  1:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan: Recipes?  Nah, I usually just eyeball it and then taste it a bunch while regularly adding stuff to make it sweeter and weaker.  I find that most things start tasting really good around 70 proof (Everclear is 190), right before they get too sweet, so it can be a hard proportion to hit squarely.  The key is to approach it slowly, I think, and clear your palate between taste testing.<br/><br/>My friend Dan, the guy who introduced me to infusions, made a bacon liquor which is seriously the worst-tasting thing I've ever put in my body.  The problem was that the Everclear ripped all of the artificial smoke flavoring out of the bacon, but the bacon flavor itself didn't really transfer.  So... just to offer a small warning to all those bacon vodka makers out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134440/#Comment_134440" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T13:43:58+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  1:43PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like bacon...I like vodka.

I do a little bit of everything, but weirdly enough, ActionScript has been paying the bills for the last good while. I mostly work from home, but keep flirting with the idea of taking a steady office job again. Just haven't met the right gig yet.<br/><br/>I've got a wife (who is also a work-at-home web programmer) and a daughter who's just a bit over a year old. I do stuff with them. They're both pretty sweet.<br/><br/>I do a lot of improv. A show a month or more with my <a href="http://www.improvforevil.com/" rel="nofollow">regular troupe</a>, a <a href="http://www.flyingtheatermachine.com/" rel="nofollow">kids' show</a> on Sundays, play and direct Micetro on some Saturdays, do more short-form on Wednesdays, go to rehearsals, take classes and workshops, play in one-off shows and cagematches, participate in people's other film and sketch projects, and work on other long-form narrative formats. On Friday, we're doing a totally improvised musical. This all takes a lot of time out of my schedule.<br/><br/>I play games when I get the chance. Single-player video games fit into the slots between baby and improv best, but occasionally I'll be able to get it together enough on a rare free Friday or weekend night to play board games or RPGs with some friends. I signed up for a month of WoW after an absence of a few years, but lost interest almost immediately.<br/><br/>I live in Austin, TX, so many of my friends are in bands. Sometimes I get out to see shows. We also have the <a href="http://www.originalalamo.com/" rel="nofollow">best movie theater in the world</a> here, so occasionally I'll make it out to some sweet-ass event there. I love karaoke, and whenever I get the chance, I drag people out to sing punk and metal songs along with a <a href="http://karaokeapocalypse.com/" rel="nofollow">live band</a>. It is <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2844104150006339148&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">awesome</a>.<br/><br/>In my copious free time, I <a href="http://www.gizmet.com/" rel="nofollow">design games</a>. I've mostly been concentrating on board games with my <a href="http://flywheel.gizmet.com" rel="nofollow">design group</a>, but I've got my fingers in a couple of RPG and computer game projects as well. Combine lack of time with my natural slowness, and you're a long time waiting for those.<br/><br/>I mostly watch TV that has come and gone, and that is easily available in one big chunk. Big fan of Battlestar Galactica, not so much Heroes and Lost. We're currently working our way through season four of The Wire, and still haven't gotten around to the last season of Deadwood. I recently filled an important hole in my nerd knowledge by blowing through all seven seasons of Buffy recently. I really wish I'd spent that time on something else.<br/><br/>I've got a wood shop, but it's been idle for quite some time now. I like to cook, but I don't much any more. I have shelf after shelf of books, but most stuff gets read on the internet, on the can, or while I'm waiting for my allergy shots to kick in. I kind of wish I had a commute, so I could read more. I stay up way too late, and wake up way too late. I used to have a whole shitload of comic books, but they were "lost" a long time ago. Every once in a while I try to get back into writing or drawing or playing music, but all of those valves seem to be stuck on Intake. If I could figure out a good way to switch them back to Output, I'd be happier - and busier. I probably spend too much time with my pal the Internet, but I still feel like I'm way behind on everything. I have a bike, but I drive everywhere. I can juggle, but I don't often. I eat fire, but my torches have been packed away for a long time. I have a subscription to Make and a soldering iron, but my robot projects are packed away in storage. I did tai chi and aikido off and on over the years, but mostly these days I'm either sitting down in front of one glowing rectangle or another, or jumping around like an idiot in front of people, waving my hands wildly while I try to tell a little story or something.<br/><br/>I'm sure there's more, but that's all I got for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134524/#Comment_134524" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T02:09:01+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  2:09AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2008 2:33AM by johnzo.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Passport:</b> Canadian.  <br/><br/><b>Job:</b> Nerd<br/><br/><b>Major Creative Timesink:</b> I had a semi-promising fiction career at one point -- got nominated for some short fiction awards, got mentioned in the <i>Year's Best</i> summations, got "send me more" letters from novel agents -- but the economics of freelance original fiction are awful.  There's way way too many writers writing for way way too little editorial demand.

I write <a href="http://www.greetercomics.com" rel="nofollow">Greeter</a>, which is like Dune in a Wal-Mart, and the <a href="http://www.comfort-guide.com" rel="nofollow">Comfort Guides</a>, which are airline safety guides for the rest of your life.

I both design and code, working in a mix of C, C++, PL/SQL with occasional spots of Java (and once in a while I have to read some FORTRAN from the old days).  It's a fun job because it combines so many different parts of the field: in the same week I may be writing complex SQL, playing with geometric algorithms, looking at a multithreading problem and optimizing network communications.<br/><br/>PHYSICAL<br/><br/>Exercise, alas, at the moment seems to be restricted to talking shortish walks.  In the summer (when it's too hot to walk) there is swimming.  I need to exercise more, but I get bored too easily.  In my younger days I used to hit people with sticks to keep fit (that is, I fought in the SCA).<br/><br/>MEDIA<br/><br/>I read a lot, mostly science fiction and fantasy for fun, although I do try to throw in a couple of classic novels a year.  I also read history and science for entertainment, and I'm usually in the middle of some technical book for work.  I do read a bit of manga and moderate amount of web comics.<br/><br/>We mostly watch TV series after they're over by getting the collections from Netflicks and blasting through them.  We watch a certain amount of anime, too (I'm a .hack fan).<br/><br/>I don't really play video games aside from simple computer games from <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Popcrack</span> Popcap.<br/><br/>OTHER INTERESTS<br/><br/>I'm a (semi-inactive) editor at www.chessvariants.com.<br/><br/>I like to cook, but haven't had as much time or energy for it of late as I'd like.<br/><br/>I occasionally go through periods of writing fiction (light SF and fantasy, mostly), and even have the requisite shoebox full of rejection slips from the days when I tried to sell it.<br/><br/>We go to Science Fiction conventions as a family, even though the local con scene in the greater Phoenix area is kind of dreadful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Novembre" title="Novembre"><img alt="Novembre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Novembre">Novembre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134651/#Comment_134651" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T13:30:20+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  1:30PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys and girls have lives a lot more interesting than mine. I'd like to be like Paul, and if I was a woman, I'd like to be like Julia. Reading this thread makes me feel like a little, sad, angry man.<br/><br/>Work: right now, I'm so dissatisfied with my current job (R&amp;D manager in a chemical company) that I'm strongly considering to return to my previous job (pharmacist), a career that I was not happy with but was good at. I had a job interview just yesterday, and they would be very (<i>very</i>) happy to have me on board. I had two other interviews in the past weeks for higher profile positions, but, if these positions will ever materialise, it will be not in the immediate future. My current employer is a gamer: he could possibly read this, and, well, I'm not so worried about that. Problem is, he's a long-time friend also. This is gonna be difficult.<br/><br/>Hobbies: I'm more a boardgamer than a roleplaying gamer, really, but maybe this doesn't count as "something else". I like to do that little papercraft that goes with the hobby: I spent the last weekend making the oracles' decks for IaWA. They look very nice, translated, with a fancy font, matched backs in different colors, and just the right size to be sleeved. It's more about the papercraft than the game, really. One of these days I should pick up origami again. In the past, I exercised a lot more than I do now. I practiced kendo for some years, and learned a lot about what my mind and my body could do with a little motivation (a lot more than I could think). Currently, I'm looking for a new gym to go and lift some weights to put me back in shape: the last two gyms I went were strongly politically connotated, in a way I don't like at all (this can totally happen here in Italy). Recently I discovered that I like to walk outdoor in the country, and I hope to do some more in the future. I got myself some technical wear, now I need to study the local countryside and plan some walks. I read a lot, but not fiction. Lately, I found that I can actually finish a book cover to cover in a reasonable amount of time only if I spend a weekend reading, and I like it this kind of focused activity. <a href="http://www.anobii.com/people/novembre/" rel="nofollow">I'm registered on anobii</a>. I'm very much into music. I used to play drums in a band when I was young. Right now, I'm constantly listening to <a href="http://www.elioelestorietese.it/" rel="nofollow">Elio e le Storie Tese</a> (the best band you non-Italian people have never heard of).<br/><br/>Relationships: right now, I'm single (this has changed since I posted in the "Who are you?" thread). Not really worrying about it, though. I feel so guilty about the last split up that I'm not really considering a new relationship. Relatives are constantly asking me about my sentimental life, and worrying about me. Not my parents, though, and I thank them for this.<br/><br/>Other: I'm 40 and look like 25. It's a blessing and a curse together. The other day, the lady at the parking lot tickets booth called me "sweetheart" ("stella", actually, like you do with little kids). The things I'm mainly enjoying right now are my new house and my new car. My new house is in a quiet neighborhood 15 Km north of my birth town, and it has a large window to east, from which I can see some beautiful dawns when the weather is right. It's too large a house for a single person, but it's sort of an open space on three levels, and I'm enjoying the extra leeway. I got even a dedicated gaming room! My new car is an <a href="http://www.audi.it/audi/it/it2/Gamma/TT/coupe.html" rel="nofollow">Audi TT Coup\xe9 2.0</a> that is a real pleasure to drive, smooth and powerful. I like it so much that I'd like to have a longer commuting drive, actually. Yes, when I'm driving it all my environmental conscience melts away, as polar ice in a greenhouse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134658/#Comment_134658" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T13:50:47+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  1:50PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Work:  I babysit dentists at a major university dental school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEducation:  One thesis shy of my Master's in Russian Feminist History.<br/>\nRight now I'm brushing up my Russian and French in hopes of getting a translating gig that doesn't eat my soul.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFun:  <br/>\nI read.

I seriously want to form a band. As jonathan suggests above, sometimes I take half baked game ideas and toss them into InDesign, imagining what they'd look like all un-pinocchioed.<br/><br/>Sometimes, when I'm not exhausted after work, I like to cook real meals, with food in them.

I do education reporting, which is a passion of mine. I also write game reviews for the newspaper and for a statewide news magazine and I write game articles and a Dad's Eye View column for a regional magazine called Mid-Ohio Valley Parent. <br/><br/>Home: Been married 8 years to a teacher, and we have two boys, ages 6 and 2, who give me plenty of material for the aforementioned Parent column. We have two cats that I really want to get rid of because I am allergic to them, which causes me all sorts of health problems. We just bought a house in Williamstown, W.Va. that is about a block from our church and two blocks from my parents' house. It's like Everybody Loves Raymond, only less Italian.<br/><br/>Other activities: I'm really involved with the Methodist church I and my family attend, and I'm hoping to get the youth group there involved in some gaming activities as well. A couple of buddies and I are working on getting a local gaming club going, which is challenging in this area because the one comic book shop/gaming store in town shut down around Christmas and the only other one is a town over, so though there are gamers in the area, they are very splintered. My main hobbies revolve around games, mostly of the non-electronic variety, some freelance writing and being an aspiring author who never writes anything or tries to get published. Love comic books, love cartoons, love super heroes in general, and I love fantasy novels, but my reading time has gone down dramatically because of the kids and because most times I am reading roleplaying books.<br/><br/>I am still trying to do a podcast, mostly because I cant do all of the reviews I'd like to in print form, and sometimes I just wanna talk about games or interview someone about games that doesnt really fit with the columns I write. The podcast has been on hiatus since last year because of computer problems and moving into a new house, but I plan to start it back up this month or next. <br/><br/>And that is about it.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134997/#Comment_134997" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T20:13:25+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  8:13PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I teach mathematics at a boarding school.
