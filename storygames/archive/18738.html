We all come from different horizons : some art, some philosophy, some cinema. I expect a lot of variation in the comments. So take the time to explain. And remember that we are among friends.<br/>- I'm looking for answers that <i>everyone</i> could understand. I had, when I was a student, a 25 hours course on "what is an action?" (no joke). If we need a 25 hours of course to explain rpg, we're missing the point.<br/>- So, the discussion might be <i>heavy</i>, but the conclusion has to be <i>light</i>.<br/>- The sole objective to the answer is to <i>broaden the audience</i> of rpg.<br/><br/>And, yeap, I'm a native french speaker, so deal with it.<br/><br/>Let's get started :\n<blockquote>Role-playing games are no more theatre than they are novels, movies, paintings, textbooks, sculptures, ethos, critical essays, TV serials, or mathematical theories.<br/><br/>As in, one can draw lines between role-playing and any of those activities, but they are definitively and entirely _not the same thing_.</blockquote>\nFirst thing Ben : I think we mostly agree. What you are missing, I think, is my point. I'm not saying they are the same thing. I'm saying they are <i>overlapping </i>and that I would be dump not to use theories from them because they have similarities.\n<blockquote>It's really common in the early days of a given medium that the critical analysis work will all make borrowed analysis using theories of more established media: i.e. when movies were getting their start, most of the theoretical work was done using theatre as a framework, with the idea that a movie camera is just a way of reproducing a theatrical performance easily.</blockquote>\nI agree with you (that said where the hell is that analysis comparing theater to rpg, because I'm still looking for it). But, in the end, doesn't movie and theater overlap? Yes, for sure, cinema has its specifics, but understanding it from other medium really help point them all. And the final vocabulary for cinema is not built from scratch.<br/>And let's say you would have to introduce cinema to someone, would you say it is about "traveling" or "telling a story, just like in theater"?\n<blockquote>Why is that? Because when you adopt your critical language and frameworks form a different medium, you also adopt the aesthetic ethos of that medium. Ultimately, if you use theories that explain role-playing as a form of improv theater, you will end up at the conclusion that the highest form of role-playing is actually improv theatre. If you use theories that explain role-playing as a form of novel, you will end up at the conclusion that the highest form of role-playing is actually a novel. And so on and so forth, with all the things I mentioned above.<br/>... Because the highest form of role-playing is role-playing.</blockquote>\nI know what you mean. But then again, if I'm looking for the pure form of role playing game, I want to look at that 10% that is very specific and explain the rest in a way other people can understand me. You are chasing your tail if you're looking to build it from the ground up ...\n<blockquote>Ben is totally right. Role-playing games are role-playing games, and nothing else (though of course we can see things in them that relate to other media we are familiar with).<br/><br/>I think formulations like Vincent's "It's a conversation" in Apocalypse World is a part of this kind of aesthetics. There are also things that happen in roleplaying that happen nowhere else: There's this dance between personal imagination and partial expression of that imagination to give a social and imagined (as in functionally <i>imagined</i>, not as in "not real") weight to what's happening in my head. Weird stuff.</blockquote>\nConversation is specific? Really? Have you done improvisation? It follows the same process, the same dance. In cinema, the <i>nouvelle vague</i> was doing the same thing. I do believe it is not that weird.\n<blockquote>I dunno; I don't think the Term For The Activity matters all that much; I think it's probably more important to embrace history and take what we've got in "role-playing games" rather than reverse-engineer a term that is a definition in itself. I mean, "Film." That's just the physical medium that images are imprinted on. It doesn't take into account the process of directing, acting, editing, sound, etc. It's just a word for the medium that <i>of course</i> has nebulous boundaries.</blockquote>\nThat's a good point. We need to explore that.\n<blockquote>So i am all for the different tracks, but we should be allowed to analytically divide the tracks. To give us tools and patterns that lessen what is not known about out hobby.<br/>Maybe it's just what *i* need to do.</blockquote>\nYes. That is what we need to do, or so do I think.<br/><br/>Now, just a thought :<br/>- We call them "role playing <i>games</i>", but there are no winning conditions (it should be a toy then). Would that be a difference?<br/>- It is mostly done between friends. Is that also a difference?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420539/#Comment_420539" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T02:53:50+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  2:53AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a game, not a toy, if you have meaningful decisions to make that change the course of play. It's one thing that separates RPGs from improv theater. Like, we can't stay in this scene any longer because I've made a choice that has cost me something, it has consequences and so we have to move on. It's not like I'm suddenly directing everyone to go this or that way. We are all playing a game that has rules that allow me to establish certain things if I manage my resources correctly, take some risks, bide my time to make the perfect move, etc.<br/><br/>As a side note from someone who also knows English as a second language, can I just say that I find the word "play" to be huge in terms of meaning? We do not have such a word in Portuguese. Play is both a noun and a verb. It can mean to toy around with something, to engage in a game, to act in-character or to use a musical instrument. In Portuguese, these are "brincar", "jogar", "interpretar" ou "tocar", four very different words. In English, it's all play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420542/#Comment_420542" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T04:58:35+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  4:58AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If not <i>game</i>, then perhaps <i>roleplaying system</i>.

Of course <i>system</i> is a very neutral and generic term.<br/><br/>As someone who has done a fair amount of improvisational theatre, I can see a lot of parallels with certain styles of play. Similarly, as someone who has done a lot of wargaming, I can see plenty of parallels with other styles of play. As a sculptor and artist I can see similarities to working within a medium to achieve a desired result, and as someone who has designed a few games, I can see mathematical and social theory underlying the system mechanisms.

And just as other forms of media can be used for different purposes, so can role-playing be used for different purposes.

Sculpture, LARP and tabletop roleplaying have different HOWs, but the purpose can be the same.

Tabletop roleplay is a medium of expression, as is larp. And they overlap. I made analogy to the way photography and film overlap. Some elements are very similar, such as the use of lighting and framing and perspective. But film has things it can do by changing the scene over time, things like jump cuts and swipes that don't mean anything in a context of still photography (unless you get into funky art show tricks, maybe). And similarly, photography can pack a lot more density of subject into a single photograph because you have time to study it and notice all the details. So the way that film and photography interact with time is drastically different.<br/><br/>Likewise there's a huge potential difference between the way a tabletop game and a larp deal with spatial relationships. Tabletop games almost always occur in a single confined, shared space with a small group of people who all hear everything that everyone says (unless you do the "go outside with the GM to talk about stuff" or "pass secret notes" techniques). And the medium greatly benefits from that intimate sharing of the imaginary space. Larp, on the other hand, tends to occur with larger groups in larger spaces with each participant having a more varied experience compared to the others. This leads to a phenomenon I call simultaneous action, which I consider to be the most unique defining aspect of the medium. It's the sense that, within the context of a shared constrained event, that there are parts going on that you are not participating in, but you recognize them as being part of the event you are participating in. The closest thing that tabletop roleplaying usually gets is when some games give you a sense that there are options available that your group did not explore that would have made the story turn out differently - but that's a different thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420846/#Comment_420846" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T17:51:57+00:00" title="August 28, 2013  5:51PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's a game, not a toy, if you have meaningful decisions to make that change the course of play.

This is taken from wikipedia\n<blockquote>If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a toy. (Crawford notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are toys, not games.) If it has goals, a plaything is a challenge.</blockquote>\nWill Wright has declared that he had always intended SimCity as a toy. Yes, it has a clear goal, it needs meaningful decisions, but it could last forever. There is no <b>end game</b>. And keep in mind that Will Wright did consider those games/toys had "educational purposes".<br/>Do <i>rpg</i> have clear goals? I don't think so. Does<i> your</i> specific game at <i>your</i> table, with <i>your</i> players, given <i>your</i> story, <i>your </i>setting and <i>your</i> system has a clear goal? Then maybe. May this goal change? I guess so, but still, you're not changing the <i>game</i>. <br/>Is there an endgame in rpg? no (it is certainly not having the biggest hand of dices).<br/>You might agree or not with me, I think it is not really important. What's my concern : how can we benefit from presenting the hobby as no "end game toy" (choose a better wording).<br/><br/>2. About the improv : it does really work with a "scene framing" "freeform mechanic". At some points, one player/team takes over the other and "closes" a scene, move on to the next part of the improv.

What was your intent/goal?<br/>That said, and maybe I'm wrong, I do think those kind of definitions are always work of progress, never ending.<br/><br/>More to come later from my part (on the morrow, I hope).<br/><br/><i>Disclaimer : I'm very glad this kind of discussion seems to provide enthusiasm.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420861/#Comment_420861" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-29T08:30:32+00:00" title="August 29, 2013  8:30AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2013 8:32AM by WarriorMonk.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What's my concern : how can we benefit from presenting the hobby as no "end game toy" (choose a better wording).</blockquote>\nI see your point, however, in a thread I can't remember where, we figured out that any RPG forces players to establish clear objectives on each scene, though not always end-game ones.

Sometimes we introduce new players to this hobby, and we like to begin with cooperative games.<br/>One of our recent discovery is <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453/space-alert" rel="nofollow">space alert</a>. How do we introduce it? <br/><i>It's a game where we play together, exploring the universe, in a very challenging environment, with some fucking crazy time constraint. It's a real challenge.

One of us is going to have a special role, he/she's going to be the GM, playing out the "world". You don't know exactly how to play? No problem, it's all about having fun together.</i><br/>What's the endgame? Two things :<br/>- It's not fun anymore (or not as fun as other hobby competing ours, such as : cinema, tele series, sports, drinking in bar ...)<br/>- the story is over ... we don't have much more to say ...<br/><br/>At some point, I think rpg should be <i>magic</i> !!!

This is how it should be for new comers.\n<blockquote>The closest thing that tabletop roleplaying usually gets is when some games give you a sense that there are options available that your group did not explore that would have made the story turn out differently - but that's a different thing.</blockquote>\nThat is not another thing. That is the main thing !! We're selling out "take part in a great story hobby", such as LOTR, AGOT, AWOT. We're in the hobby of creating "great stories" (the real thing, no?), and "having options" wouldn't be the main thing?

You see, the key here is the word "boardgame" which everybody knows what implicates: there will be turns, a board and other pieces, clear rules and a clear endgame. All the rest of the introduction you made is meant to convey what's the fiction created by the game like. <br/><br/>Of course, having a clear idea of what any RPG campaign is gonna be like, actually depends more on the GM than on the rulebook. I mean, yes, VtM was supposed to be more like an story game to explore the struggle of the characters between what made them human and the nature of the monster within them... but some GMs still played it like gothic superheroes. All I'm saying is that a well prepared GM could sell it's game better than:\n<blockquote><br/><i>We're just going to spend time together, playing "characters", who are usually heroes, in the context of telling a great story, a great adventure. One of us is going to have a special role, he/she's going to be the GM, playing out the "world". You don't know exactly how to play? No problem, it's all about having fun together.</i> </blockquote>\nA prepared GM could even give players a clear and interesting endgame, as in <i>I'll play the world, so you'll be up against an horde of undead that plage the kingdom. You will play the heroes, so you either die all together or succeed together. You don't know how to play? No problem, I'll guide you trough the game, and all players will be working together with you.</i><br/><br/>Maybe even better, without giving too much spoilers. By the way, Endgame isn't supposed to be:\n<blockquote><br/>- It's not fun anymore (or not as fun as other hobby competing ours, such as : cinema, tele series, sports, drinking in bar ...)<br/>- the story is over ... we don't have much more to say ...<br/></blockquote>\nOtherwise you're GMing it wrong or your GM doesn't know how to close a campaign. Endgame should be more like the end of an story arch, with the bonus that you could play another story arc with the same characters if the GM and the system could handle it. That story arc should have an specific endgame, like "escaping from the prision ship", "Defeating the Necromancer", etc. Even if the players don't know which is exactly from the beggining and even if the GM isn't sure of what would be the endgame when the game starts, both will come to an agreement on that by some point in the campaign. Either when a climax is reached or when the GM is running out of encounter ideas, it's time to wrap it up with a big massive battle and/or an epilogue for the story of the heroes. Start anew with their descendants if you want, but please stop before it stops being fun. If you don't it becomes like insisting on playing monopoly to the last penny when there's already a clear winner.\n<blockquote><br/>At some point, I think rpg should be <i>magic</i> !!! You don't get all the "tricks", but you're just amazed !!! This is how it should be for new comers.</blockquote>\nI agree that you don't need to know all the tricks when you start. At least, not the tricks in fiction. What you should be given before playing are at least the basic tricks of how to negotiate the fiction in RPGs, which are actually something you can't play with, and the reason you get nervous about it or think is too complicate instead of enjoying the game and discovering the mysteries within.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420933/#Comment_420933" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-31T15:51:50+00:00" title="August 31, 2013  3:51PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2013 3:52PM by pells.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some things first :<br/>- there seems to be some problem with the "words" we're using.

It's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_%28rhetoric%29" rel="nofollow">tautology</a>, a common logical error.<br/>More seriously, what I'm saying is that we have our head so deep into that shit that we don't see such common mistakes.

We're saying <i>exactly</i> the same thing ...\n<blockquote>Endgame should be more like the end of an story arch, with the bonus that you could play another story arc with the same characters if the GM and the system could handle it.</blockquote>\nThat's what I mean by "nothing more to say ...". You can call it story arch, if you want ...\n<blockquote>That story arc should have an specific endgame, like "escaping from the prision ship", "Defeating the Necromancer", etc. Even if the players don't know which is exactly from the beggining and even if the GM isn't sure of what would be the endgame when the game starts, both will come to an agreement on that by some point in the campaign.</blockquote>\nIs it "defeating the necromancer" or "taking him prisoner" or "take his place after killing him" or "join him"?<br/>We're saying the same thing here : there is an "endgame", at some point, but it might change in time ... And we don't know it at the start of the game. That is my point.<br/>This freedom really seems to very specific to rpg, or so I think ... For a boardgame, you know the object of the game when you begin. It is not something we construct together on the course of play.\n<blockquote> Start anew with their descendants if you want, but please stop before it stops being fun. If you don't it becomes like insisting on playing monopoly to the last penny when there's already a clear winner.</blockquote>\nThen again, we're saying the same thing, really. You're describing is what we call in french, a <i>voeux pieux</i>. You might say that when you marry someone you should take care, and blablabla, as to avoid divorce. Truth is, half of married people divorce.<br/>You just have to realize, I think, that sometimes, people just stop playing because it's not fun anymore (yes, it shouldn't be like this, but ...).

I described card games as "games where we use cards for things" and board games as "games where we use boards for things". It then logically follows that I define roleplaying games as "games where we use roleplaying for things". I don't mind it having an absence of logic if it's accurate. I'm making a firm statement of "As Cards Games have only the concept of cards in common with one another, Roleplaying Games have only the concept of roleplaying in common with one another." Except maybe, "They all have at least one player, whether human participant or not." I can only say that one because I know of no card game, board game or roleplaying game that allows for a 0-player game, but I'm quite happy to be proven otherwise. I'm mildly concerned that either Vincent or John might make one just to prove a point.

Nothing I say is a personal attack on any one person or idea. And yet I find I am still <br/>hesitant to post my reply despite all these caveats and disclaimers. But, in the spirit of <br/>what Pells outlined above, I'll share a first draft of my own \u201cWhat is a Role-Playing Game?\u201d <br/>and let the (cow)chips fall where they may. In particular: it was the comparison to toys and <br/>Sim City that really surprised me and made me think that I might not be quite so alone in my <br/>pontificating. So - (deep nose-breath):<br/><br/>\u201cWhat is a Role-Playing Game?\u201d <br/>   Table-top RPG's (Role-Playing Games) have evolved so much over the years, it makes a <br/>single definitive answer too general to be <b>helpful</b>. An RPG might have a Game Moderator/ <br/>referee (or it may not); it might have a single player or several players; each player may <br/>have one Character to play, or several, or they may all share just one Character! There may <br/>be dice, cards, maps,  miniature figures, or none of these things.<br/> <br/>  However, there are three things that all RPGs have in common: rules, fiction and characters. <br/>  But other types of games have these as well. Even the game of Chess could be viewed as a <br/>fictional battle field where characters are moved according to rules. Chess has inspired <br/>other table-top war games and war games have, in turn, inspired Role-Playing games. So, what <br/>makes RPGs so different?<br/><br/>   The difference lies between Play and Game and their effect on Roles. Briefly and very <br/>simply:<br/>  Play is open-ended, interpretative, without explicit predefined goals.<br/>  Game is challenging, focused, has  definitive end-states.<br/>  Role is defined in social context as a set of connected behaviours, rights, obligations, <br/>beliefs, and norms as conceptualised by actors/players/Characters.<br/><br/>  \u201cLet's pretend\u201d is Play. "Let's Play "house/doctor/space marines". Toys promote Play. Simcity was described by it's creator Will Wright as a software toy; technically, it is categorized as a non-game. <br/>  Chess is a Game (even though you might imagine the pieces to be robots or wizards). Poker, <br/>in all it's variations, is a Game.<br/> <a href="https://www.google.ca/#psj=1&amp;q=calvinball" rel="nofollow">Calvinball </a>is Play and Game; it has one rule: you can't play Calvinball the same way twice. You can win at Calvinball but nobody is sure how.<br/><br/>RPGs are Play. They are also Game. They are a strange hybrid of the two modes. <br/>  On a moments notice, perhaps with a single word or roll of the dice: <br/>- rules may be changed, ignored or even made up.<br/>- focus may shift from one character, theme, event or purpose to another.<br/>- goals and challenges can be created, achieved, failed or simply abandoned.<br/><br/>  Having said all that, RPGs are not quite Calvinball; they have a number of rules to <br/>provide structure, and winning is not necessarily an end-state. <br/><br/>  So, \u201cWhat is a Role-Playing Game?\u201d<br/><br/>  It is a <i>Game </i>(rules) in which one is <i>Playing </i>(fiction) a <i>Role </i>(character).<br/>  I told you it wouldn't <b>help </b>; )<br/><br/>    RPGs are guidelines for players to explore, interact and affect, and expand on fictional <br/>worlds through their Characters.<br/>   The \u201chows\u201d and \u201cwhys\u201d are very much dependent on the RPG and the participants.<br/>  So, what is <i>this </i>Role-playing Game.<br/><br/> <br/> I then go on to explain my own game (which is specifically geared towards new gamers and <br/>old gamers returning to the fold but I won't derail with all <i>that</i>). So, yes - roleplaying <br/>games are games in which we role play, as circular as that sounds. The question Pell posed <br/>is "What is role-playing games?" (it should be "What <i>ARE</i> role-playing games" but your <br/>English is much better than my French so I will "deal with it", mon ami ; )<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420993/#Comment_420993" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-02T11:35:03+00:00" title="September  2, 2013 11:35AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>RPGs are Play.

How about they are game <i>within</i> Play? I think that play seems more important than game ...<br/>Let's get back to "The Sims"/"Sim city" (I think The Sims is even more obvious as a toy). It has better be <i>fun</i>, and a lot of it. It might be challenging, true, but there is frankly not point to it (in the sense of "no winning condition"). <i>Having fun</i> seems to me like the "entry point" of the activity.<br/>You may play chess in a very competitive way, in a tournament for instance, where <i>having fun</i> is not the reason of the activity. Is that possible for rpg?<br/>Then again, I'm talking in a very general way, addressing a crowd of non rpg players, trying to broaden the audience of the hobby (I know there are competitive rpg out there).<br/>I really like what Rickard spoke about, in the original thread, as why do we need rules (why do we need the game part)? Because we want <i>uncertainty</i>. Failure is possible in the story we are going to tell.\n<blockquote>It is a Game (rules) in which one is Playing (fiction) a Role (character).<br/>I told you it wouldn't help ; )</blockquote>\nIt helps none the less ... I think the fiction/story part should be emphasized, no? <br/>It seems to me it is first and foremost a <i>creative</i> activity, we do <i>together</i>, telling a <i>story/fiction</i>, playing a <i>role/character</i> where <i>failure</i> is possible (rules/games) ...<br/><br/>Another thing that came to me about the activity, in the context we are talking about is <i>together</i> and the <i>DM</i>.<br/>For newcomers, rpg really seems like a cooperative activity. It is something we do together.<br/>Also, there is a DM, a <i>guy in charge</i>, if you would prefer. Now, that is not specific to rpg. <i>The guy in charge</i> is there for a party, for instance. Or at the workplace, to animate a meeting. It's even there for other games, like boardgames. For instance, when introducing new players to a boardgame, I'm usually the guy in charge who explains the rules and how it works.<br/>In rpg, it is just that there is a "formalism" around that role.<br/>And then again, he is playing with the players (unlike the bio terrorist of pandemic).\n<blockquote>The \u201chows\u201d and \u201cwhys\u201d are very much dependent on the RPG and the participants.</blockquote>\nI agree with the <i>how </i>... but the <i>why</i>?

I think that it's important to describe RPGs to new players in an open and neutral  (play-style agnostic) way. I can describe <i>my </i> game in as biased a manner as I want because the game is going to reflect my gaming style. But it must be made clear that not all games are like <i>this </i>one.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>"Having fun seems to me like the "entry point" of the activity."<br/>Absolutely - but "fun" isn't necessarily dependent upon Play. See below.<br/><br/>" I think that play seems more important than game ..."<br/>So do I - but many people would disagree. In particular, I recall one gamer saying she didn't care for all the talking (ROLE-playing) and just wanted to get to the combat (Game). She wanted to engage the mechanics. Personally, I don't find that as fun as I used to; all the modifiers and charts and tables that I used to be fascinated with no longer hold the "magic" they once did. But that's just me. If someone wants to play Pathfinder or GURPS, who am I to steer them away? <br/><br/>  This is why I don't "think the fiction/story part should be emphasized". That speaks towards a particular preference or play-style that isn't universal.<br/><br/> I suppose someone with more time on their hands could draw a comparison between Role, Play(ing), and Game to GNS theory - but, whatever problems one might have with GNS, I think we can all agree that it isn't suitable as an entry-level introduction to RPGs. Keep it light, keep it simple.<br/><br/>"It seems to me it is first and foremost a creative activity, we do together, telling a story/fiction, playing a role/character where failure is possible (rules/games) ..."<br/>  Again, I think we share a similar approach to gaming but it is not universally shared. I would point out that Fiasco doesn't just accept failure as an option, it's mandatory. Also, I've played games where I knew the characters would "win", the fun was in seeing <i>how </i> they would win and what it would cost them.<br/><br/>"Also, there is a DM-" Well, again that's not true for some RPG's. <br/><br/>  At this point, I want to clarify that I'm not trying to throw your words back in your face. I just want to draw attention to certain assumptions you are making about RPG's. There is a bias in your definitions which I largely share, but is not conducive to introducing people to RPG's in general but rather to a play-style that you (and admittedly, I) like. A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">true and fair answer</span> to "What is a role-playing game?" has to address that.<br/><br/>Just one more:<br/>"I agree with the how ... but the why? Having fun telling a great story, no?"<br/><br/>  I was actually referring to "why does this RPG use dice/cards/miniatures/etc. and not that one" or "why does this RPG feature combat but that one features negotiation?". I think it's important to know why the rule/procedure/convention/mechanic exists as well as knowing how to use it. But maybe that's just my bias. Someone new to RPG's really has to do their research before committing to a particular game.<br/><br/>  But I found your answer (" Having fun telling a great story") particularly interesting because of something I was reading last night. It was a thread at theRPGsite that was linked to from this forum somewhere. It was all about how RPG's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't tell stories</span>. Period! And, boy, were they riled up about it! At first it was amusing but after a few pages I started to get a little uncomfortable. I mean, this was some hard-core opinionated, my-way-or-the-highway play-style preference. And that's fine by me. Play the game you want, the way you want to play it. What bothered me was how vile and rude the opinions were. Imagine if you were interested in learning about RPG's and you happened upon <i>that </i>thread. I know that I would conclude that gamers are a bunch of jerks and lose interest immediately. This is my concern with regards to "What is an RPG ?"  It has to be open and unbiased.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420998/#Comment_420998" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-02T15:14:39+00:00" title="September  2, 2013  3:14PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2013 3:15PM by TildeSee.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It helps none the less ...

For my major examples, I'm putting forth "It's Complicated" and "Hot Guys Making Out". There isn't even "resolution" in any regular sense of the word in those, but they're definitely games, and very much roleplay. Also in many games nobody plays just one character. See "Microscope", for example. As BiffBoff points out, Story is a point of contention in RPGs. Also there are more than a few games that have outright solo play, like "Beloved", "Brave Sparrow", or "Hikikomori". I would very much give any of those to newcomers to the hobby. Creative I'll grant you, though. \n<blockquote>Also, there is a DM, a <i>guy in charge</i>, if you would prefer. Now, that is not specific to rpg.</blockquote>\nToo many counter-examples for that to be a good generalization. Heck, I even know a few games with multiple GMs. "How We Came To Live Here", for example, has two GMs and between one and three Players. The two GMs don't even really share authority, either.\n<blockquote><br/>I agree with the <i>how </i>... but the <i>why</i>?

Card games are card games because they use <i>cards</i>. But look at all the different card games out there. There is no utility in presenting a generic description of card games over simply describing HOW to play a specific card game. RPGs are the only media I know that still does this, and then they often drop the ball when it comes to clearly describing how/why to play too.<br/><br/>The reason I think we fuss over having one definition to rule them all is that our culture here is based on the assumption that there's a central concept uniting us. That's why theRPGsite reacts so strongly to 'redefining' roleplaying games, because to them it's cultural appropriation. But after reading close to 1000 RPG and RPG like games, I believe a central definition is as likely to do harm as good.<br/><br/>As for the more specific part of this inquiry, there are actually very few RPGs where improv/theatre is <i>required as a part of play</i>, and if it's not required, then it's not what the game is <i>about</i>. On the other hand, there are no LARPs I know where it isn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421011/#Comment_421011" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T04:22:22+00:00" title="September  3, 2013  4:22AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pells: Nobody's going to create your version of "What Is a Roleplaying Game" but you!<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421013/#Comment_421013" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T05:38:31+00:00" title="September  3, 2013  5:38AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><a href="/forums/profile/biffboff">@biffboff</a> : yes, you're right, I do have a bias.

Is it so taboo to attempt a definition of RPGs?  Are RPGs so esoteric as to defy definition? Why are there as many posts saying "don't try" rather than actually trying? I know, I know, the "reasons" are stated in your posts but then, why even post a comment to decry the effort? What is the motivation (and fascination) of joining in on a conversation you consider to be pointless? <br/><br/> "Shush now. You're wasting your time and you may hurt someone." I don't know how to respond to that so I'll let it stand.<br/><br/>I do know that we define card games in simple, easy to understand (and non-physical) terms: a trick-taking card game; a bluffing card game. No, we don't need to describe what cards are. But what if we did? Read the intent of the topic again. <br/><br/>Perhaps we're too close to the subject matter - too entrenched in RPG culture to see it from an outsiders point-of-view. And yes, some of us are so encamped in our own style of game that we must disavow any association with "that <i>other </i> type of RPG" (whatever <i>it </i> may be, since we can only see the differences, not the similarities).<br/><br/>Pells has made clear his bias for a certain type/style of RPG and if he were to push that agenda over at theRPGsite it would certainly come across as " cultural appropriation". But I'm a little surprised by the resistance here. And for that reason, if no other, I hope he continues with the topic. We may learn a little something about ourselves in the process.

It never happened to you?</blockquote>\nIt happened twice, and both times it felt clearly like somebody was playing it wrong. It was either the GM (and many other players could testify the same) or me (because there're still other players that keep playing with them) I must add, in both cases, though the group split, some people kept playing with the same GM and others kept playing a different game with a different GM. So I wouldn't exactly say everything about the game was suddenly not fun anymore. All players still agree that different parts of those games were engaging, but there appeared a disagreement about how to negotiate the fiction and/or the general mood conveyed at the end. Definitely a theme for another thread.<br/><br/>I'll get back to the definition, but first let me address the big elephant in the thread:<br/><br/>I guess part of the reason people don't want to make one may be because the Forge/GNS fiasco is still fresh on their minds. There's a lot of hardfeelings there and even some resentment. Yet everybody values the results enough to keep referring to them and keep making designs around it. Its solid, stable, works, it's easy to understand and its fun. And creating a new definition sounds like throwing away the monument to the fallen dreams, blood and sweat of our fellow RPG players/designers/theorists/philosophers, and saying cheerfully somethig like "Oh, let's build a huge mall here and paint it pink!"<br/><br/>Or worse, declaring they were wrong.<br/><br/>Of course I don't think they were completely wrong, nor that defining RPGs is an easy task; but it's certainly a task that remains unfinished, that will remain unfinished after we make our contribution. Why? <i>Because what RPGs are is being redefined with each new game and what each new player understands of it.</i> It's like language: new words keep appearing, being adopted from other languages, others become obsolete, etc.<br/><br/>On top of that, the one we're trying to make here shouldn't be like a full theorical unifiying definition, but more like a paragraph that we could use to describe it better to newcomers, and at that, one that some of us could tweak to explain our games. At least that's what the OP wrote, so I'll stick to that and go back to the definition:<br/><br/>-A Roleplaying game is like play-pretend, with rules to negotiate the fictional world that players will create as a group. Players will interpretate (switch as appropiate: different characters, different aspects of the same character, etc), the rest of the fiction will be defined by (switch and mix as appropiate: a single player, a different player each escene/turn, a randomizer, etc) and the base material players will use to make the fiction will mainly limit to (insert here the genre and references appropiate to the game).<br/><br/>As for the rules we will use for negotiating the fiction, there are <b>principles</b> (insert here the one your game uses), several more or less structured <b>techniques </b>(insert here at least the most basic needed to play your game) some <b>prep</b> to be done (explain what is expected from every player/gm before the game starts)<b> rules</b> to limit or guide player and GM input in one way or another (here goes the modular chain of processes like conflict resolution mechanics, specific limits for abilities, skills, equipment, etc as needed) though rules may be ignored, created and even made up in favor of techniques; these may be ignored, created and even made up in favor of principles and these, though slightly less usual, may be adjusted by player consense.<br/><br/>Uh... perhaps that last paragraph came out too technical, I'm not sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421029/#Comment_421029" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T11:15:32+00:00" title="September  3, 2013 11:15AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2013 11:16AM by lumpley.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It did!<br/><br/>But I think that your version of "What Is a Roleplaying Game" would be clear and useful.

I'll post about the subject tomorrow.<br/><br/>But first, some <i>disclaimers</i> :<br/>- I'm working on a rpg product that I finally intend to release. It's some kind of a big campaign that looks like a story board and a system that is a hack of TSOY.<br/>- We're really designed it so at to aim at new players (and strangely, it only works <i>too well</i>, which creates me a problem with rpg gamers.)<br/>- So, this thread is not "disinterested" from my part : I do have an immediate problem, presenting rpg to new comers in an attractive way. It's not <i>theory</i>.<br/>- At some points, writing those posts, I get help from Francis, my co-designer. We both have a university degree in philosophy.<br/>- I'm not the guy who knows how to <i>sell stuff</i>, I'm the guy who <i>gets things done</i>. That may explain how badly I present things ...<br/>- I don't really mind being bullied on the internet. Quite frankly, I think this hurts you more than me ...<br/>- About this thread :<br/>You might remember it was a split from an original thread where the OP just threw out the subject (mainly for the same attitude present in this thread). So, this thread had really derailed from its original purpose (more or less) : I didn't expect it to go in that direction.<br/><br/><b>About this community</b><br/>If you think there is some kind of taboo, toward addressing rpg in a <i>different way</i> (whatever that means), just know that this was <i>way worse</i> some five years ago. This community has many advantages : people are professionals, the community is small enough that it allows one to make mistakes, feedback are good ... But, yes, there is surely some taboos. And also there is a big bias in the community about a certain <i>type of play</i> (and now note that my own bias is being reproached to me).<br/>I also like therpgsiste, but I really find them dump at some points. Just like you. There is no "truth" to rpg, there is no "true way" to play it. There's just people playing a hobby. That's just plain stupid to argue about that.<br/>Look, I just love story-games, where there are mechanics oriented toward "motivation" and "traits" of PCs, where there are mechanics to deal with "non combat" conflict, where you earn xp/progression not only by fighting. It's just great. But I also like to play with some kind of "pre written stuff/adventure", in the context of a big a campaign. Who's to blame me?<br/><br/>Sometimes, at therpgsite, the way they describe rpg, I do feel there are not talking about <i>my</i> hobby. Sometimes <i>here</i> too. Get over it.<br/>One thing seems sure to me : you're both, at some point, hurting the hobby. Badly.<br/><br/><b>About the hobby</b><br/>I live in Montreal, Qu\xe9bec, and you know what I see :<br/>- in mainstream bookstores, there are boardgames being sold !!! And the department is just growing, taking more space in the store !!<br/>- I see "book where are you are the hero" making a comeback.<br/>- I see people playing, more and more (whatever the type of game). They get used to it, they meet face to face and spend evening "playing" together.<br/>- I don't see rpg in bookstore.<br/>- In <i>Le valet de coeur</i>, the famous "store of games", here : rpg are in the back and there is no customers there !!!<br/>- I see dnd turning the brand/game into some kind of "complex Descent" (almost in the form of a boardgame)<br/>- I see FFG taking no risk, just cashing money on a brand with recurring customers<br/>- I see girls willing to play the hobby and have some <i>fanatic</i> boyfriend tells her she can't play a female space marine, because of the <i>book</i> !!!<br/><br/>Now, you tell me : is the hobby in good shape? Is it growing? Are we targeting new players? Are we showing them how fun is it?<br/>Look, it's the "king of games", it's pure <i>creativity</i>. It's the <i>real stuff</i>. rpg video games weight how much money has a market?<br/>Games are a firm trend right now. We should be growing too.<br/><br/><b>About "what is rpg"</b><br/>Look, there is no "nature/essence" of rpg, just like there is no "nature/essence" of humans ... Don't waste your time trying to define it. Any "rpg theory" I have seen is made in good intention, but quite poor. Also, saying that the only thing rpg share in common is "their name" and "the fact that is a human activity" is just <i>not serious</i>.<br/><br/>Now, I might be interested in defining "what is rpg" because I want to sell a product. And, in trying to do so, if saying "rpg is theater" helps me sells it, by making it more understandable to a certain segment of market, then, so be it !!!<br/><br/>Speaking of which (segmentation of market), that is one thing we should do, as a community :<br/>Who's our customers? How many segments are there? What is which segment looking for? Which segment is growing the fastest? How do we address each segment? Where do we find them? What is the most important thing in their buying process/decision?<br/>Note : I do have a web agency, as you might [not] know, so, I'd willing to start a thread on that matter and present marketing tools/techniques if some of you are interested.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'd like to present two strange "examples" of "marketing" :<br/>- Francis was in China some time ago and he assisted at the projection of the movie "the day before tomorrow" with a rural crowd, people who had never seen movies. They were so impressed, they even scream at the actors when there was danger. Now, they just love cinema, they crave for <i>more</i>. You don't show them a arty movie !!!<br/>- Normally, when you have a business/store, you have some products that you call "lead lost". They are products, which are usually "fun" and "simple" that you use to get the customers <i>into the store</i>. They buy your lead lost, get interested to the new "activity/line of product" and then you can present them more complex/elaborate/different product/activity. You've got yourself a recurring customer !! That's what you want !!<br/>Now, we're working in the same fucking store !! Could you stop yelling at the customers to which I'm trying to sell the hobby?<br/><br/>Yeah, I know, it comes from the heart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421049/#Comment_421049" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T16:13:36+00:00" title="September  3, 2013  4:13PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2013 4:18PM by lumpley.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Pells. Take me seriously for a minute. I want to expand the market for rpgs too. I've been working at it for some years, more or less intently.<br/><br/>It's a pretty common experience for me to have someone tell me that one of my games was the first rpg they ever played. Also pretty common for someone to tell me that one of mine was the first rpg they ever GMed. Not as common as I'd like, but still, I'll stand by my record.<br/><br/>You don't do it with better explanations, better "definitions," for the games that already exist. You've described it yourself: <i>existing rpgs aren't appealing to them.</i> They aren't in bookstores because they aren't good for a bookstore's market.<br/><br/>You do it by designing new games that <i>are</i> appealing to them. This means, for better or worse, designing games that violate gamers' expectations. And this in turn means that your effort to develop a good pitch for existing games doesn't help you expand your audience at all, it pares your audience down, into those who "accept" your definition and those who don't. Newcomers don't want to be sold an abstraction, a definition, they want to be sold a fun, easy, exciting, new, stand-alone game.<br/><br/>In sum: I hope you do write your version of "What Is a Roleplaying Game."

Not that everything Pells wrote is out of place. I also feel some opinions in the forum are hurting the hobby more than helping it, but in general, it feels like there's hope for you all. Specially when it comes to looking out of the hobby and making stuff which, while still kinda based on tradition, becomes another step towards the big audience that knows nothing of our hobby. Kudos to every pioneer out there.<br/><br/>I want to share the hobby here in Peru too. I've got absolutely no significant trad fan base here to worry about, no Chick Tracts in our past, barely no precedents (there was a small boom of imported choose-your-own-adventure books like 25 years ago) it's like a total blank slate to write our history.<br/><br/>But then we also have no proper distribution, retailers we can convince into this, not much of a reference for the audience to understand the game, not enough gaming conventions per year nor publicity, or even enough spare time to focus fully on this project (we work 8 hours a day to earn our living and then we spent 4 more hours making comics)<br/><br/>So I've got to begin promoting the game, and for that I really need a good pitch sale, definition-like so people would understand what I'm talking about. So, no actual need to take this thread to seriously, this isn't the Forge, nodoby here is looking for the holy grail of definitions to unify every designer and game under a single theory.

He always said "to sell a car, you only need a good engine". It's not true. Think the <i>best selling</i> car out there is the <i>best</i> car? (Please, please, don't answer me ...)\n<blockquote>Okey, what do we got so far that here that you feel useful, Pells? I think it's better if we already start taking a definitive direction here.</blockquote>\nIn fact, there is a lot of things here that are useful, but there is also a lot noise ... And I also want a definitive direction ... Now that, I think, after 40 posts, we can [some of us] agree of the objective and the legitimacy/interest of the question.<br/><br/>Here's a first version of my sale pitch, written in the context of ExiStanc3, but also for a FAQ, to be read on a website (I've already presented this stuff earlier) :<br/><b>What is tabletop role playing game?</b><br/>Tabletop role playing games are the <i>real thing</i>!! Here\u2019s how they work :<br/>\u2022 You play face to face with, ideally, a bunch of your of friends (<i>Around a table ? People still do that ? Yes and you can even drink alcohol if you\u2019re of aged</i>)<br/>\u2022 One player is the \u201cgame master\u201d and, more or less, animates the evening (<i>not the drunken uncle type of animation</i>)<br/>\u2022 The other players have characters, usually heroes, who interact with the \u201cworld\u201d (<i>sometime characters are kinky, and this is then another type of \u201crole playing\u201d game</i>)<br/>\u2022 When the heroes face great dangers and try to save the world, for instance, the group refers to a bunch of rules to see if they succeed (<i>Yeah !! Throwing dices !!! But not for too long please \u2026</i>).<br/>\u2022 There are no winners, as the objective of the game is to create great stories and have fun together (<i>Is it then rather a toy than a game? Maybe.</i>)<br/>\u2022 Strangely, it is a really intuitive hobby, and you\u2019ve already played it (<i>haven\u2019t played cowboys and Indians?</i>)<br/><br/>Note : the italic part is meant to be bring some "funny remarks" [make you smile], in the context of publishing on the web, where people don't read much and have a time span of attention very limited. Strangely, on our tests, the italic part is the reason why non gamers continue to read it, and they've told us the whole thing was informative.<br/><br/>Now, am I happy with it? Yes and no. New comers like it, gamers clearly "don't get it".<br/>But, anyway I'll have a problem soon : I'll need that explanation for Avalanche (my campaign book) and also for Shadow and Light (the system). I won't be able to use bullet points (it's in a book/pdf) and I'll need two distinct set of arguments (maybe with some overlapping) since there are two different types of product.<br/><br/>What would I like? A pool of "arguments/pitching sale" (let's say 15) for rpg, picking the ones that fit best my product and targeted demographic customers (still knowing they are new comers, or at least not hardcore gamers).<br/><br/>How about that? It'd be very "open". It'd be "here are <i>my</i> bias, oh then, here are <i>the</i> arguments I need". Accepting and referring to our bias wouldn't be an handicap, but a strength.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Now, how should we do that? I think I'd like to do it very seriously, certainly on another thread.<br/><br/>I'd like to :<br/>- address segmentation of market, maybe do some "persona" for our customers, identify the process behind the buying decision (what's important for which demographic).<br/>- see what are the strength and weaknesses of our hobby, as compared to <i>other</i> hobbies (hockey night, cinema, reading, boardgames ...) and not <i>within</i> the hobby. I don't want to compare that style of play to another, or that rpg game to another. I want to compare <b>the ball</b> with <b>a screen</b> (see above, if you don't get it).<br/>- see where our potential customers can be reach, what they expect, and how to reach them<br/><br/>To do this exercise, we don't need "hard numbers". We may only refer to our own experiences to start.<br/><br/>I've begun working on a "canvas" for a real <i>working</i> thread. I'm looking to build the structure, put some examples and launch the discussion.<br/>Now, this is going to take me some time (which I don't have plenty of at the moment for various reasons) and I hope I can produce it by the end of next week.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> : I've seen on the original thread that you've worked [are working] in advertisement. That's the kind of things you should be familiar with, no? See below, as I think we need some to do "work" before doing "the marketing work".<br/><br/>And there is a lot of stuff in this thread, and on the original thread, that are really with what I want to do ...<br/>Finally, I'm not looking at exact phrases (medium will have too much influence), but really at arguments.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I'll let this thread open for :<br/>- commenting on my definition of rpg :  have fun with it !!!<br/>- commenting on the thread I'm offering to start : what you expect, do you have ideas on the structure/form, would you like us to produce something like a pdf out of it?<br/>- just plain arguing about what I'm trying to do and discourage me of this impossible task (because I don't want to see that on the other thread)<br/>- If you have questions on how it is done. Usually, it is done in a single room, with the experts, brainstorming : we throw a lot of stuff on a whiteboard and summarize. By the way, this might be a way of doing this : have a first "template post", open discussions, and from time to time, re-post the template updated. I'll have to think of this.<br/>- if you just want to throw ideas around : what you've read/heard about the hobby from new comers, what you think are its strength, weaknesses, why people seems curious. That would help I think.<br/><br/>Examples? Sure :<br/>- In Montreal, there is a bar (it's not the only one) where they have large tables and a bookshelves full of boardgames. There are no rpg. Why? Well, on Wednesday, Francis goes practicing some "fencing" and when it rains, they go this bar. Rpgs? It's those big books for the rules, and another big book for the story. Too complicated, too much prep time. This is how it is perceived. It's a weakness.<br/>- Francis is part of an amateur troop which is "making medieval shows" (with horses and swords, stuff like that). Most people there loves cosplay and to "play" in the show. For them rpg is a way to "have <i>big</i> shows", to go further, just limited by their imagination. That's a strength.<br/><br/>Oh, lastly, thanks to everyone, even Vincent. This really helps me none the less and I think we (whoever is we) are going into the right direction ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421083/#Comment_421083" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-04T16:06:11+00:00" title="September  4, 2013  4:06PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2013 4:08PM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So I've got to begin promoting the game, and for that I really need a good pitch sale, definition-like so people would understand what I'm talking about.</blockquote>\nThis is actually intriguing for me.

After all, if the sole objective of the answer IS to broaden the audience of rpgs, then the LAST person they should be dismissing is Vincent, because in Vincent's relevant experience <i>they may be asking the wrong question</i>.\n<blockquote>There seems to be an odd resistance to this topic. Is it so taboo to attempt a definition of RPGs?  Are RPGs so esoteric as to defy definition? Why are there as many posts saying "don't try" rather than actually trying? I know, I know, the "reasons" are stated in your posts but then, why even post a comment to decry the effort? What is the motivation (and fascination) of joining in on a conversation you consider to be pointless?</blockquote>\nBecause people HAVE tried. Over and over again. Look at pells' definition so far. Is it any different than the definitions that exist online and in almost every RPG? Have those definitions broadened the audience, or <i>narrowed</i> it?<br/><br/>In addition, most RPGs still do a terrible job of <i>explaining how to play the game in the first place</i>! A general definition is not going to help when we still have trouble defining our games well enough that they can be played! And comparisons to other forms of media only help when those similarities actually <i>apply</i> to your game.<br/><br/>Again, if you want a <i>useful</i> definition for an activity, look at the <i>physical</i> constraints. For tabletop RPGs: You're sitting at a table; Only one person can speak at a time; Actions must be described; All descriptions are limited and open to interpretation; Engaging the rules takes time; etc. Now how many of these are shared with board games, or card games, or LARP, or movies, or books, or theatre, or the process of creating them. For that matter, how many of these are even considerations in RPGs?<br/><br/>And the reason physical constraints are important is because that's what determines the kind of actions you can take. A movie cannot respond to you yelling at the characters, but an RPG <i>can</i>. And yet many times I feel my roleplaying in an RPG is equivalent to yelling at a movie screen. It certainly <i>feels</i> meaningful (in exactly the same way yelling at a movie does), but as far as the RPG is concerned it's not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421096/#Comment_421096" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T06:13:07+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  6:13AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Respectfully, I submit that you are missing the point. Pells started with a broad definition and is slowly narrowing it down to his own needs. He's not trying to come up with a definition that describes <i>your </i>game (which, I think, is where the main resistance to the topic is coming from- "how dare he!"); he's simply getting opinions to help with <i>his </i>game. Perhaps he could have made that clearer from the start but he might not have received the kind of input he was looking for. At any rate, at this point in the conversation, it's clearly the case.  <br/><br/>It's a big discussion. It starts from the general and narrows down to the specific. Shouting "Don't talk about this!" is not only unhelpful; it borders on trolling. It really isn't up to you to decide what might or might not be helpful to pells. It just isn't.<br/><br/>And, yes, pells will have to consider the physical aspect of his game. I'm sure this will be a big point in his new thread. Welcome to the conversation.

Stop talking about this" , respectfully remind them that it's really not their call.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421126/#Comment_421126" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T13:24:29+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  1:24PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>\u2022 There are no winners, as the objective of the game is to create great stories and have fun together (<i>Is it then rather a toy than a game?

Thinking creative ideas within a framework of options is our work, and despite how simple results may seem, it's complicated. That said, I'll do give you for free a really good advice on how to sell RPGs with <a href="http://nerdtrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dragon.jpg" rel="nofollow">one of the oldest and most iconic images used by our hobby</a><br/><br/>Do you know what made this image so powerful as a sales pitch? I'll tell you:<br/>-First of all, powerful use of the most iconic themes of the game: A Dragon, here representing almost unsurmontable misterious challenges. A Warrior, facing the dragon corageously with a magic sword. A pile of treasure, as an obvious reward for defeating this enemy. The scene happens in a ruined Dungeon, which again, evocates mistery. All these things encompassed in a single picture paint perfectly what the game is about (at least in theme).<br/>-Second: we don't see the face of the warrior, allowing us to imagine it ourselves. He might as well have our face, making us readers dream we may as well be that guy, gaining the virtues he is displaying for our own. We may feel ourselves daring, strong, relentless, etc.<br/>-Third: the hole composition puts readers in the action. Even if we're not anything like the warrior, we may as well be standing right behind him in this fight.<br/>"Adventure is not a step ahead, it's here about to bite your head off!" is what this picture yells to me, and it's still one of the most powerful reasons I got into the hobby.<br/><br/>Well, I dunno how much of this was on purpose (perhaps more than you'd think), but that's how it works on the reader's mind. The old slogan was "Adventure is yours" which I'd say it could still work very well for new audiences. And that's advertising to you, sir.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421132/#Comment_421132" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T15:45:08+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  3:45PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/anon">@anon</a>.adderlan :<br/>- Really, I do sound aggressive?

Do I need to state what a <i>selling pitch</i> is? For this, just see below.<br/>- I don't feel like I've dismissed Vincent. He had proven himself to be, in fact, very useful. And my guess is that now he understands more what I'm looking for (his goals are clearly different than mine).\n<blockquote>And the reason physical constraints are important is because that's what determines the kind of actions you can take.

It certainly feels meaningful (in exactly the same way yelling at a movie does), but as far as the RPG is concerned it's not. </blockquote>\nNow, you see that is interesting. And that's the kind of thing I'm looking for. Speaking recently with new comers we had identified this as a problem. Is it an unfaithful promise from the hobby? I couldn't tell ...<br/>That said, many "non gamers" (mostly girls who played in a group with their respective boyfriend) really liked the activity, but they also got the feeling you're describing. We're selling them great stories, great adventures. We tell them they'll take part in it, but hey, finally it's just about rolling dices and seeing a "bad story" just goes on, where they can't interact fully with it.<br/>Now, total disclaimer : Avalanche is built to "solve" that problem, to allow creativity inside a defined story, of epic "grandeur", but that really allows you to take part in it. It's a toy meant to be broken.<br/><b>Important</b> : I have not necessarily <i>designed</i> it at the time, to solve that <i>particular</i> problem, phrased in this <i>specific</i> way. It doesn't matter. If I want to sell it, I need those kind of feedback.<br/><br/>An anecdote : I've spent like five years, trying to understand what I was doing, putting it in perspective of the GNS, putting it in the context of theory; nobody understanding what I was doing because it was so strange. It's was just so complicated !!! After five years, I've discovered I was just doing a storyboard, a quite common thing in fact.<br/>Two years ago, I meant a non gamer (well, he had been a rpg gamer in his youth, a little, some twenty years ago) who was intrigued with my project. I had brought the book and without a word from my part, just flipping thru it, in a few seconds, he just said "oh that's cool!! You're doing a storyboard!!". Fuck.\n<blockquote>Perhaps he could have made that clearer from the start but he might not have received the kind of input he was looking for. At any rate, at this point in the conversation, it's clearly the case. </blockquote>\nTo be exact, I did realize that you need to take into account the <i>bias</i> involved (thanks to you), as to come up with a pitch sale. I didn't say "game", but bias, which is just much wider. Also, I think my bias is shared by some of you, who could help, from one thing, help me understand my specific bias, and help me build the pitch upon it. My bias might not be that common in this community, but hell, I think it has some echo.<br/>As for why this thread was started, frankly, it's just to state that if I want to sell my game, and broaden to a larger crowd of non gamers, and if, while doing so, I say rpg is theater, well, I'm entitled to.\n<blockquote>I prefer Tenra Bansho's take on this, goes around something like "If you help everybody have fun, you win the game." </blockquote>\nI like the help part, it's better. But I miss the "story part". Maybe the argument should be separated.\n<blockquote>Ok Rickard, one thing about people in Advertising: we never work for free.

I guess this had been the <i>definition</i> of rpg for a whole generation. And this is way better than any definition, or theory, or GNS. But note that this pitch sale has a bias to it.

Flying in the face of it are the hordes of people playing out power fantasies as their own.  It was good work in it's time, but it was primarily for self-publishers who had to sell by word of mouth.  Who had to believe that the rules were them most important thing.<br/><br/>Within the Forge and contrary to the GNS, I got a meme going regarding the 'act' for 'role-playing gaming' called 'Shared Imaginary Space'.  In the land of the Forge, it was impossible to discuss the ramifications of that idea.  I am very fond of the idea of Story-Games, but once again I see that as a redaction of creating and maintaining an SIS.  (So it doesn't really come out like theatre; it's actually 'Lets Pretend' for grownups.)<br/><br/>The biggest problem, by far, you will experience looking for grounding idea to base your advertising on is the name: role-playing game.  Our game design hobby is both insular and hide-bound against one important fact: we don't own the term 'role-playing game' any more.  It belongs to the Final Fantasies of the world, the Fallouts, the Mass Effects, the Diablos, and to the one that most closely resembles OD&amp;D - your Worlds of Warcraft.<br/><br/>Another Aside: I was learning computer programming back in the eighties when D&amp;D crossed the critical threshold into common parley.  Individually, we programmers threw an obscene amount of effort into turning D&amp;D into a computer moderated game.  My strongest and most honest opinion is that World of Warcraft became that game (for a while).<br/><br/>If we are to advertise, we must look at our strengths and not our history.  Those strengths are also the weaknesses of those who now own the 'role-playing game' banner: imagination and social interaction.  There will never come a time where a graphics processor will trump the imagination or the SIS (largely because imagination is only sometimes visual).  And, as yet, the internet has not superseded meeting someone in person.<br/><br/>To this end, I have begun referring to the games of our hobby as 'spoken-word gaming'.  Not for accuracy, but for differentiation.  The biggest problem with sticking with the old-school terminology will be confusion with computer and console games.<br/><br/>Further, after a market study in the nineties, my wife and I concluded the way to get into bookstores, grocery stores or any retail establishment was subversion.  At the time, this meant writing the 'Goosebumps' role-playing game.  We explored the idea to the point of requesting the licensing for that brand.  Back then, publishers did not separate 'game rights' between board, card or electronic, much less SWG.  My wife has an intuition for things like this and proclaimed Harry Potter as a 'Next Big Thing' after skimming the first hardcover on it's release week, so I've felt we had a small edge.<br/><br/>During the Goosebumps and Harry Potter era, I worked in a bookstore and gained a good perspective on how ordering works.  Simply, if the brand was hot, we ordered it, without regard to the format; posters, sticker books, comics, candy or anything.  We realized one simple vector to get more gamers was to license.  As fans, they would sweep everything, even our thing.  And where licensing was impossible, to emulate.  It was my idea that we should have a center core product line that these licenses and emulations would draw players back to.<br/><br/>So I began to develop Scattershot.  It has twelve core products covering most genre of role-playing games.  It's been designed so that a simple or more introductory version could have flavour dropped in and new products turned out quickly, but professionally.  Our basic advertising idea was simple: 'Did you like Harry Potter?  What if you could BE IN Harry's world?'  Since the licensed product would be ordered by pretty much every bookstore in America, we'd get broad exposure.  With the hints of 'advanced' play, some of those people would come looking for the core product geared for magic or coming of age games.<br/><br/>Before long, you would expect those bookstores to start asking for what their customers wanted 'next'.  And bamf!  We're in the bookstores.  Now, things have changed a lot since then.  Licensing in role-playing games is far more restrictive.  I'm also betting you aren't marketing a multi-genre game system, but I'll leave our story as food for thought.<br/><br/>Fang Langford                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421143/#Comment_421143" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T19:42:39+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  7:42PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Fang, that's very interesting. Some thoughts ...\n<blockquote>Within the Forge and contrary to the GNS, I got a meme going regarding the 'act' for 'role-playing gaming' called 'Shared Imaginary Space'.

I like the "let's pretend for grown ups".\n<blockquote>The biggest problem, by far, you will experience looking for grounding idea to base your advertising on is the name: role-playing game.

But the term is still very strong <i>within</i> the geek culture. I strongly believe that Diablo. Fallout and the like, not only stole the term, but also one "way of playing/genre/bias" of the hobby. If I want a good "dungeon crawling/tactical/munchkin", I'll go with Diablo or Mass Effect. TTrpg is just a lost cause for me there. Even some tabletop like WoW, from fantasy flight game doesn't do it ...<br/>Maybe another example : the last shadowrun video game (funded by kickStarter). Too much in the "middle" for me : a "not so good" storyline/interaction and a "not so good" munchkin game. Like you say, mimicking the "story aspect" of rpg is very difficult for computers.\n<blockquote>If we are to advertise, we must look at our strengths and not our history.

Now, this promise (the one of the illustration), is the one of Diablo and the like ...<br/>You mention our strength, but I think we also need to look at our weakness. The "average gamer" (your target demographic who plays game and put money in it) is about 38 years old. He has a family, not that much time on its hands, and there is a lot of competition, from other hobbies to get his attention/money.<br/>For instance, rpg [might, in its classic way] needs lots a prep time. The crowd is also a problem at some point and there is also, I think, need for "someone to take stuff in charge" (the DM). This list is not the only problems I see ...<br/>For instance, I know a teacher who really loves to play, but doesn't master any rules, doesn't have time to prep games (or think reading rpg adventures are just plain boring) and the only people he knows who could play with him are some kind of ... well ... let's say hardcore gamers ... who don't care about the story, but want to "level up" characters. No surprise he doesn't play anymore ...<br/><br/>We need to come up with games that address those issues. And we need to state to our customers that this is what they will be buying. How come reading a rpg adventure is the dullest thing in the world? How is that supposed to create good "stories"? Seriously. That's one the thing we're trying to do with Avalanche : have a rpg campaign that could be fun to read as a novel (but not a novel, because we want it to be played, so very open).\n<blockquote>Before long, you would expect those bookstores to start asking for what their customers wanted 'next'.

And I think we need to ask those questions. Really see the hobby as it is for those who don't play it; not those who design games (no offense intended to anyone here).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford" title="Fang Langford"><img alt="Fang Langford" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/042/nYHKMUMQV2HC4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford">Fang Langford</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421148/#Comment_421148" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T23:35:13+00:00" title="September  5, 2013 11:35PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2013 11:36PM by Fang Langford.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great response!

Thanks, this has been quite enlightening. For here in Peru I was thinking of using the term "Juegos de Aventuras" which could be translated into "Adventure Games", except that in spanish, the word "Aventuras" is actually the plural of adventure and used here in this way makes an slightly reference to "Adventure" as the recount of it, as an story but with the plus that you're also adding strong emotions related to it. I'm not sure if it has the exact same translation in english, since "Game of Adventures", whle closer to the literal translation, doesn't give the same atmosphere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421167/#Comment_421167" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-06T09:05:07+00:00" title="September  6, 2013  9:05AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Actually, I target anyone BUT the "Average Gamer".  They are already the audience; we need to approach the unexposed/underexposed directly...now...and with gusto!</blockquote>\nThat's also the conclusion we see coming. <br/>And one of the audience we would like to target : the <i>girlfriend</i> of the gamer. Offer her a game which would allow her to play on her <i>terms</i>.<br/>Just an anecdote, which will provide some information to <a href="/forums/profile/Paul88">@Paul88</a>.<br/><br/>We're aiming at a very easy to pick up game. We have designed rules that are more or less a hack of TSOY, but very simplified. Now, we're playtesting with a broader audience, fine tuning the playing material. We're using also Avalanche, our campaign (which we playtest also, at the same time). Avalanche is a storyboard, full of illustrations (around 450). So, we invited a gamer, a friend of our, with 2 girls, not gamers (they have played a little in the past, but they find rpg too complex for their taste).<br/><br/>Shadow and Light, our system is meant to be played without any explanations. We have developed a character burner, just like in burning wheel. It is a four steps process, where you go into more details of the character at each step. But every step work the <i>same way</i> (this is very important). The idea is just to throw the players in : talk about your character, don't worry about the rules, you'll get them along. For the character idea, we just put the book of Avalanche on the table : the players flip thru it, and just get ideas ("I want to play those guys", for instance). It works very well.<br/><br/>Now, the first thing we encountered : the gamer didn't want to learn the rules "all along". He wanted a complete explanation before making <i>any</i> decision (Shadow and Light is a point distribution system. There is nothing random. The first step, for example, is to distribute 20 points between magic/body/heart/sense/spirit). So, the DM took 15 minutes to explain how it works. This is just a killer for the non gamer. They didn't care about the explanations and found it boring.<br/>Then, the choice of character. For the non gamer, they really just went thru Avalanche, finally choosing characters type (one, for instance, was an innkeeper in a big city). The gamer wanted "a knight". Do you have knights in your setting?<br/>The process of creation went very well, with the non gamers just following the flow, understanding it, not trying to maximize : they were just telling the story of their character and building on it (Shadow and Light is built to help do that).<br/>The last step of the process is to choose what we call "benefits". There is no list (you just invent them), and benefits can be anything : from objects, motivation, traits, spells, special abilities, asset, relations. The non gamers just used what they described earlier and wrote down "stuff" they had from their story. The gamer : only objects (an armor, a horse, a magic sword ...). That's character development !!!<br/>Lastly, and this is tricky. In Shadow and Light, benefits are not "advantages or disadvantages" : they are just there, and sometime they are one or the other. For instance, having "relationship with the king" is a disadvantage if you deal with petty thief. You trait "fierce" might be an advantage in combat, but a disadvantage while trying to reason someone. <br/>Anyway ... All the non gamers had traits and motivations. But not the gamer. The DM forced him to choose some. He chose, at the very hand of the process, "alcoholic" and "dishonored". Which is fine : his character was a dishonored knight, now fighting in the "pits" with the low lives, to gain money to drink. Now, that's a character !!! But ... we had to <i>give</i> him the points for those traits.

Maybe, the mere fact that we need to state this tells something of the hobby ... or how it is perceived. No?<br/>I believe "her terms" is something you describe below.<br/>Now, a true story : we were meeting an old group of gamers (we're all around 35/40 years old now), with their families. A "girlfriend" of one the gamer heard us talk about creating our own rpg. She met us apart and "warned" us (very seriously) of what she wanted in the game. Easy to play, rules light, fast combat and not just "physical" ones. And could it about more than "killing stuff"?\n<blockquote>I'd say the untapped market is people who enjoy light, short, social games like Apples to Apples but think role-playing is too heavy, too long, and too weird.</blockquote>\nI guess this is a segment. They are others. I think people are really curious about the hobby ...\n<blockquote>So make lighter, shorter, less weird RPGs. Steer clear of knights and dragons. Hell, steer clear of combat. Steer clear of dice, for the most part. </blockquote>\nYes, lighter, shorter, and maybe "no exceptions" in the rules. I think <i>fantasy</i> is not necessarily a problem per se. The genre is still popular at the moment. Combats : I think "conflict" is important and a big part of the hobby. The problem is the emphasis on physical conflict (hack and slash). Dices seem okay to me, but : you need to use it for <i>meaningful</i> things and don't use it for a <i>long</i> time.\n<blockquote>Oh, wait. Fiasco already did all this.</blockquote>\nOkay. I've took a look around at it. It's pretty well rated. Can you talk about how it is being <i>sold</i> (not designed) and/or <i>received</i> in various communities?<br/><br/>---<br/>Some various thoughts :<br/>- <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> : in french "adventures" also have a "sentimental" sense. Having an "affair" is "having an adventure" in French. So, I guess we could go with "<i>En manque d'aventures?</i>" [missing/craving for adventures?] or "<i>En qu\xeate d'aventures?</i>" [looking for/questing for adventures]. Note the double sense "craving" and "questing" that French allows. I find this funny ...<br/>- the name "rpg" : we believe we want to use the name as it is and position our game as the <i>real</i> rpg (see our "definition above"). "You have heard of rpg? Have you ever try the <i>real</i> thing?". The funny thing is that dnd, in its first edition, wasn't really about having a <i>role</i> (it was mostly tactical in our opinion).<br/>- The how to play : we're planning to produce a series of short (1 minute) videos, called "DM's tricks", presenting concrete examples of a group playing and "how to play". We're going to also use a certain "webserie" approach to those videos : there will be character and a [light] story. Well, at least, we'll give it a try.<br/>- About the next thread : Shadow and Light is almost ready to be presented. We have enough material to "distribute it" in, let's call this "alpha" version. I'm currently preparing a page to present the game. What I'm proposing is to have that thread (presentation) to present the material and a second one, to discuss demographic and advertising. I think it would be easier to clearly state that I'm looking for help on a specific problem (my game) and see if this could also help others.<br/>- I've found a group of people who offers to "play test" and review, for free, "games" before they hit kickstarter (I guess this is good for both parties). Now, I've asked them and they don't do "role playing games". I'll go with the "arguments" (of the second thread) and try to understand how to reach this demographic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>"What is roleplaying games" or "Is roleplaying games theater?" - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18738/what-is-roleplaying-games-or-is-roleplaying-games-theater/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content='"What is roleplaying games" or "Is roleplaying games theater?" - Page 2' itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18738/what-is-roleplaying-games-or-is-roleplaying-games-theater/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I'm not the expert in how Jason Morningstar is selling Fiasco.

There is no list (you just invent them), and benefits can be anything : from objects, motivation, traits, spells, special abilities, asset, relations. The non gamers just used what they described earlier and wrote down "stuff" they had from their story. The gamer : only objects (an armor, a horse, a magic sword ...). That's character development !!!<br/>Lastly, and this is tricky. In Shadow and Light, benefits are not "advantages or disadvantages" : they are just there, and sometime they are one or the other. For instance, having "relationship with the king" is a disadvantage if you deal with petty thief. You trait "fierce" might be an advantage in combat, but a disadvantage while trying to reason someone. <br/>Anyway ... All the non gamers had traits and motivations. But not the gamer. The DM forced him to choose some. He chose, at the very hand of the process, "alcoholic" and "dishonored". Which is fine : his character was a dishonored knight, now fighting in the "pits" with the low lives, to gain money to drink. Now, that's a character !!! But ... we had to <i>give</i> him the points for those traits. There was <i>no way</i> he would spend points to buy "disadvantages" : this made no sense !!!<br/><br/>We then threw them in the action and it went well. But, still, I hope you see my problems ...<br/></blockquote>\nCool! I've been working on something similar for a while. I loved FATE aspects for that, but I couldn't get to play the game with my group because because having a bunch of hardcore powergamers make up aspects of their own would totally botch the game (believe me, we sorta tried) So now I'm keeping a list of skills, space for equipment AND a list of Aspects separately.<br/><br/>In our design, these aspects could be motivation, relations, traits, signature weapons (and here, only the description of the weapon counts, not it's capabilities) racial traits, backstory facts... it's more like having everyting story-related of the character on the same space of the character sheet. On top of that, there's a bigger list of aspects available for each class and race on the respective entries for those in the book, so players have less trouble making up a character able to fit in the setting. It's not like they can't come up with their own traits, but the lists are long enough that any player with a blank page syndrome can ignite their creativity there.<br/><br/>And of course, these story related traits are all free, as the GM actually needs those hooks to get the PCs into the story, or even write the story based on those characters. I'm setting the minimum amount of traits to 5, and giving players a modifier of 1 on each of them. Players can add it to the dice roll whenever they can invoke them for an advantage and GM can use them as a penalty when applicable. On top of that, the more the trait is used, the more that modifier increases, up to +3 for system convenience. I'd reccomend you to go for something like this, for old gamers to go through character creation and come up with characters instead of mincing machines or arcane walking nukes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421282/#Comment_421282" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T15:02:39+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  3:02PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Going way back to a question from the top of the thread, I found a couple articles where people addressed theater &amp; larp.

Just to keep in mind, I see two different setup here : only gamers playing together, and gamers playing with non gamers (you could also have all non gamers, but it's not about the same issues).\n<blockquote>In our design, these aspects could be motivation, relations, traits, signature weapons (and here, only the description of the weapon counts, not it's capabilities) racial traits, backstory facts... it's more like having everyting story-related of the character on the same space of the character sheet.

But I prefer to use the list as examples and let the players create their own. Also, while creating characters : I think one of the main issue we have with "traditional gamers" (read dnd, dungeon crawler here) is that they are used to get equipped to go into a "dungeon" and survive the shit the DM will throw at them. It's a good reflex, but we're not playing this game anymore. It's not about going into a "dungeon", in a large sense : a linear set of "challenges". It could happen in a village ...\n<blockquote>And of course, these story related traits are all free, as the GM actually needs those hooks to get the PCs into the story, or even write the story based on those characters.

Just watch the newbies !!! Anyway, with those type of games, the gamers will soon find out that they don't need all that "max out" anymore (look, it's going to be <i>boring</i> the hell for them).<br/><br/>As for the gamers only games, well, maybe, they don't want motivations nor traits ... maybe what <i>they</i> want is to go into the dungeon and survive. And it's right.<br/>Trying to bend some "unbroken" rules to fit their "style" might not be the best way to get them to play differently, I think.<br/>Bring non gamers with them ... maybe ... for a <i>change</i>. Just make sure your non gamers have a hard skin ... and give them a hand !!!\n<blockquote>Going way back to a question from the top of the thread, I found a couple articles where people addressed theater &amp; larp.

It's not like that's gonna be used in the product, but more like an issue hardcore RPG gamers have with the game, than newcomers don't.<br/><br/>Pells, I see your point and while I understand the reason behind those rules in your game, I'd still object to having players <i>buy</i> their ties into the story. While good GM can surely balance any issues coming up from this, it seems you've already found that not buying them botches the game for that player. <br/><br/>What about giving players a minimum amount of free ties into the story?

Even if those ties are disadvantages, it means more spotlight for that character, or having that character more involved in the story. Of course, GM can solve this by splitting spotlight evenly and having PCs develope more ties as the story evolves, but trust me on this: lots of newcomer GMs fail to develope this technique by their own on their first 5 games, some never get it and a lot of those give up GMing thinking that it's not for them.<br/><br/>Now, if design-wise, you've got a really important reason for having players buy "benefits", I'll understand and pester you no longer about it.

And yes, it is very simplified.\n<blockquote>What I find a bit offish is your reference to gamer and non gamer? It sounds like winner and loser. or winner and fun seeker.<br/></blockquote>\nSee WarriorMonk.\n<blockquote>Why not create a game were there are no winners or losers just story tellers. Identification with drama, fiction and fun.</blockquote>\nIt is in fact, what we're doing. There is no winner or loser. It only provides a frame to create characters, have them progress and a way to resolve conflicts (all type of conflicts, all the same way). It turns out our character creation process is enabling/encouraging the players to create characters <i>anchored</i> into a setting, with some stakes at hand (enemies, value to defend). <br/>Now, how is it going to be used? I can't answered it. Really. You can use the S&amp;L to do dungeons and hack&amp;slash. Could it be fun? I guess. Is it the best game to do it? I guess not (WoW does it better).<br/>S&amp;L is <i>meant</i> to be open. It is not style restricted.\n<blockquote>I don't think you have got the right product for what you want to achieve , thats not to knock what you have got.<br/>This new market of the non gamer and the gamers girlfriend want to have fun possibly not game.

We believe that to achieve what we're [you're] describing, it needs a two part component : a system and some kind of plots/setting/adventures/background/screenplay. That's our other product, Avalanche, which uses a [multi plots, calendar based] storyboard approach. It is non linear and excludes all reference to PCs. It's really giving the GM a sandbox/frame to play naturally <i>your</i> story [into the big picture], just like a child (as close as a grown up can go). It also helps a lot when creating character, providing strong imagery.<br/>Does that make sense to you? The problematic, to us, is not only solved by rules.<br/><b>Note :</b> thanks to this community, we have decided to present our product separately.\n<blockquote>Pells, I see your point and while I understand the reason behind those rules in your game, I'd still object to having players buy their ties into the story.

Easy to do : characters distribute 20 points for buying benefits as they want, then, just give 16 and have four mandatory points distributed into "story related". I wouldn't make it part of the official rule, tough (but, it's a good trick) : up to the GM to decide (see the "open bias" above) ... Or see another solution below.\n<blockquote>Another different issue that comes from this (which, again, good GMing can solve easily, but remember not everyone becomes good at GMing in a short time) is that having a PC with less ties into the story than another can be unfair. Even if those ties are disadvantages, it means more spotlight for that character, or having that character more involved in the story.

Now, note that not all players necessarily want the same amount of spotlight (at least, that's what we see in our games). That said, what we want with S&amp;L : when the spotlight is on a character it should be <i>fun</i> (in a very large and consensual sense) and challenging (whatever the <i>type of stories</i>, the <i>type of conflicts</i> or the <i>type of characters</i>).<br/>That said, here's another advice, thanks to you : if you want some spotlight (and especially if everyone in the group wants the same amount), <i>players and the GM </i>should decide together how they "buy" their benefits (as it has a severe impact on the story behind told). Maybe they want a minimum or a maximum, but it is <i>open</i> for them to decide.<br/>Frankly, it shouldn't be imposed, we think, but discuss openly in the group.\n<blockquote>Now, if design-wise, you've got a really important reason for having players buy "benefits", I'll understand and pester you no longer about it. Except that maybe then you shouldn't call it "benefits" if they have a chance of being disadvantages at some point of the story, feels sorta like cheating the players into buying something that will backfire on them, while you can make them buy it by honestly telling them that when it backfires, it would be fun. </blockquote>\nGood call for the name ... We're using the french translation of <i>acquis</i>, which means literally "something you have acquired or is part of you". There's no good/bad connotation to it. A better wording to propose?<br/>Lastly, in S&amp;L, all benefits can backfire at you. Examples :<br/>- Entering a church with a powerful sword may hinder you (is it from an enemy god or seen as a treacherous act?). Falling into the water with your armor can hinder you.<br/>- Being an important member of an organization that suddenly becomes rogue will surely hinders you.<br/>It also works the other way around : <br/>- being an "alcoholic" makes you resistant to alcohol and sometimes provide a social bonus.<br/>- being "blind" makes you better at hearing someone trying to sneak by you.<br/><br/>Now, how much does it hinders/helps you? As much as the advantage/disadvantage.<br/>The important thing here is "how much". Our system is based on the <i>movement</i> of "yin and yang", there is no "bad or good", only movement between the two, strong or feeble. <br/>"My enemies' greatest strength is also is greatest weakness." Sun Zi, the art of war. That's what S&amp;L does/is about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421347/#Comment_421347" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-10T17:41:14+00:00" title="September 10, 2013  5:41PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Replying to myself ... But first, thanks for everyone who helped me here. You don't know how much this is important and valuable to me.<br/><br/>A couple of stuff :<br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> :<br/>- I said it is<i> yin and yang</i> ... it is also <i>Shadow and Light</i> !!!<br/>- all benefits should be story related ... even a sword or an armor (I know I'm quite stretching here). Buying benefits is not going to the store : it is narrating your character's story. It shouldn't be "now we're buying stuff", but "let's write all the things we talked about". And that's what S&amp;L helps you doing with a process of creating a character (thanks Burning wheel for revealing this to me !!!).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul88">@Paul88</a> :<br/>- there is "nothing" sort of a revolution in S&amp;L. If you've played FATE or TSOY, you already know the game somehow ... except it is much more simplier. It stands in an 8 to 10 pages rulebook. Everything else are "hints" and "advices". That's maybe the big difference.<br/>I've been working all week long to present S&amp;L (finally you could say). It will be all "packaged" so anyone (with some rpg bakcground [I know, I know ...]) will be able to play it. We're currently doing minor corrections and translating some texts.<br/><br/>Here's the character of, let's say a 25 level dnd wizard (the sheet is in french, but you should "get" it. Also there is some "bugs" in the sheet at the moment) :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/Sophia.jpg"/><br/><br/>An anecdote about this sheet :<br/>We have the great pleasure to work with Catherine, a designer (not a <i>game designer</i>, just a designer) : she knows how to make stuff that "looks good". She's a non gamer (and this is a good thing in the context). When we began working with her, we had those awful character sheet and so we asked her to do one for S&amp;L.<br/><br/>One of the thing we did was showing her a lot of examples of <i>rpg character sheet</i> and a lot of examples of <i>boardgame sheet</i> (might be factions, character, whatever ... she's not a gamer anyway). And we explicitly asked her "we want to look like the later!!".<br/>And I think we did succeeded. And it is done on purpose to not look like <i>role playing game</i> (compare this to Descend or WoW the boardgame ...).<br/><br/>Back to the original question of this thread : <br/>To the question : is this some kind of "boardgame" (BTW, look at this <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18778/elder-sign-is-it-a-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow">thread about blurred lines</a>)? I would gladly say "yes", without hesitation !!! I want it to look simple, I want it to look inclusive, I want it to look familiar. I want it to look sexy.<br/>On purpose. Even if this means not being accurate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421358/#Comment_421358" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T08:02:04+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  8:02AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421359/#Comment_421359" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T08:20:48+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  8:20AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2013 8:29AM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very pretty indeed!

Ok, the way you're using the benefits, I'd say forget about the hardcore gamers; your audience is among flexible gamers and newcomers. I'm playing with a mixed group of hardcore gamers and flexible ones, so my current design goes that way; equipment and skills go separatedly because my players are used to have clear options on their character sheet; some of which are based on small common and/or disposable things that have no impact on their background (by the way, perhaps that's the word you're looking for:"background")<br/><br/>And there's another separate space for all the things that vave an actual impact on their background, including things like "what makes that sword important to you?", where the player will write an actual important background fact of his/her character. I'm still allowing only one "special" item per character, since as a GM I'll take it as their signature weapon/etc and not destroy it or actively try to separate the character from it, except for narrative purposes, in which case, it would mean something important in the story and probably, it would come back to them on a new form.<br/><br/>You see, actually all this doubles as a sort of theraphy for hardcore gamers to teach them to lower their guard against the GM and that opening themselves to the story can also be fun. I do like the design I'm working on right now, but I don't think I'd publish it as it is.<br/><br/>Back to the opening question, I've just readed yesterday the best explanation on what is an RPG I've ever seen. It was on the first pages of The Dark Eye RPG, the german version of D&amp;D, which to no surprise seems to be more popular there than D&amp;D. Design-wise, 3.5 D&amp;D explanations and book layout look like an improvised tank built by the A-team, while Dark Eye looks like, well, like a solid and graceful WWII Tiger Tank. I'm totally gonna steal that and put it on a comic book format along with the Techniques from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18646/techniques-do-we-have-a-list-of-them#Item_29" rel="nofollow">here</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421392/#Comment_421392" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T14:18:14+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  2:18PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Really nice stuff!

At least my description of "benefits" seem clear. About the name ... Background has one problem for me : what about the "stuff", the traditional kitting? Would they be background? It needs to be. I've look at some translation of "acquis".

We do have the french translation of the first edition nearby : we'll go and read it. Which edition are you talking about exactly?<br/><br/>Earlier, on this thread, we were talking about imagery. Today, we have worked on a possible cover for Avalanche, our campaign that uses a storyboard. It's not complete yet, but here it is (thanks again to Catherine, our designer) :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/Avalanche_possible_cover.jpg"/><br/><br/>We are looking at something very warm, inviting, but yet, still odd and mysterious. Something that encourage adventures, mysteries. Something very "open", very far away from "dungeons".

Ah, the Dark Eye edition I found is the 2003 one, I dunno which edition it is. A good deal about why it woks as an explanation are the excerpts on the gray squares beside each block of text. Those phrases really resume the gist of it all, so you only have to real the whole text for clarifications.<br/><br/>About the word: never mind, perhaps you can keep it as Acquis on the translation and use it as game jargon. I don't think players would mind as long as the explanation of what it means is simple and clear enough, which looks like it's the case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421431/#Comment_421431" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-12T12:32:01+00:00" title="September 12, 2013 12:32PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> :<br/>- Thanks again !!!<br/>- It seems my designer had already noticed that design glitch.

It's like overprinting a color cover with a transparent varnish, in this case just over the letters fro "shade" which then could go totally in black... but that might be too fancy, above your budget and not even work too good, so, since you're already using a bright red on the illustration for the character on the right, I'd reccomend you to use red for "Shadow" and white for "And Light" Other than that, try to avoid using more than two different fonts on a single piece, it tends to give an itch too. You might go by using the font you used for "rules of play" on "roleplaying game" and make this one the same gray you used on "And Light".<br/><br/>Now, perhaps this last one would be too much of a change, but hopefully you could talk the artist to have the eyes of the character on the left glance to the right; that would make it look more suspicious and draw more attention to the game title. Hope it helps, best luck with your game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18738/what-is-roleplaying-games-or-is-roleplaying-games-theater" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18738/what-is-roleplaying-games-or-is-roleplaying-games-theater" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18738/what-is-roleplaying-games-or-is-roleplaying-games-theater/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18738%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18738%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
