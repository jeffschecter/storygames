                            Very interesting article!  I particularly like the bits that talk about American publishers (who view "theme as game") and the German publishers (who view "theme as window dressing for the rules"). Maybe that bit is particularly applicable to the way indie or mainstream designs work?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            This is an interesting notion. The one stumbling block I perceive here, though, is the relatively small number of designs that any one designer can rack up in the rolegame hobby (if you're talking soley about rolegames). The demographic curve of designers:publishedworks is I think a heck of a lot steeper in the rolegame hobby than in the boardgame hobby (or the movie-making hobby).<br/><br/>Who, for example, is the rolegame hobby's Reiner Knizia, Klaus Teuber, Stefan Dora, or Martin Wallace? If you want to be shocked (shocked!), visit <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/designer/2" rel="nofollow">his entry in the 'Geek</a> to see just how prolific Knizia is. It boggles the mind. Our hobby has no-one like this, but I guess it's all relative.<br/><br/>Who are our auteurs? The names that leap to my mind immediately are some that most probably wouldn't think of: Greg Gordon, Paul Hume &amp; Bob Charette, Greg Porter, Gerry Klug, Greg Stafford, Robin Laws.<br/><br/>Each of these guys (or pair, in the case of Hume and Charette) have published at least three games which all seem to have been fashioned from a stock of similar materials with perhaps similar approaches. They're also more or less "establishment" or "old guy" names, with the possible exception of Robin (who I tend to think of as sort of the Steven Soderbergh of rolegaming).<br/><br/>Who are the names that you immediately thought of, and why?<br/><br/>(And, as a digression, what do we do about the division between "designers of system" and "designers of resources", like adventures, campaign materials, and so on; also, what do we do about the division between "designers of system" and subsequent "developers of system" -- the classic case here would be Mark Rein - Hagen, and the rampant, non-Rein-Hagen development of the Vampire system that has become the WoD and attendant spin-off experiments?)                        </div>

<blockquote><br/>Of course, Rein(dot)Hagen also wrote Tramp Freighters (Star Wars RPG: Galaxy Guide No. 6).  I'm not entirely sure this supports the premise of the Auteur theory.<br/></blockquote>
My intention was to point out that Rein-Hagen (I will not dot) hasn't been prolific enough, I don't think, to be considered an auteur. But the claim he staked certainly played out well for other prospectors, and how. Gygax and/or Arneson probably would belong in that same camp. As would, maybe, Marc Miller.<br/><br/>Thus my comment about "development" as well as "design". Ed Stark, for example, has had his fingers in a /heck/ of a lot of rolegaming pies, and even has had "creator" credit on a number of games. But each one of those games was a "second edition" or "re-development" of an earlier game designed by someone else.<br/><br/>To what extent is Greg Gordon (who gave us Torg) or Greg Costikyan (who gave us Star Wars, and Paranoia) an auteur compared to Ed Stark (who, I believe, was principally involved in giving us Shatterzone, MasterBook, later editions of Paranoia that had little mechanically to do with Costikyan's original, and the D6 generic game system books)?                        </div>

                            I think that as games grow smaller, at least in certain circles, we'll begin seeing more and more patterns emerge.  This may, however, require us to have a more flexible idea of 'published games'.<br/><br/>So, let's look at two examples I'm fairly familiar with:  Jonathan Walton and Shreyas Sampat.<br/><br/>Jonathan Walton has 'published', in some sense of the word, a significant number of games including (but not limited to): <i>Seadog Tuxedo</i>, <i>Kazekami Kyoto Kills Kublai Khan</i>, <i>Waiting for the Queen/Tea at Midnight</i>, his unofficial game based on <i>Avatar: the Last Airbender</i>, and most recently his <i>Exalted</i>-inspired <i>Anathema</i>.  That's five games off the top of my head.  I'm pretty sure that every single one except for <i>Seadog Tuxedo</i> was written/published within the past twelve months.<br/><br/>Shreyas Sampat has officially published even less than Jon, but he's got a lot of stuff out there for people who want to look: <i>Torchbearer</i> (arguably two games if one examines the original and current drafts), <i>MSKR</i>, <i>Snow From Korea</i> (again, two games, maybe three), <i>The Golden Chain</i> (working title), and <i>The Garden</i> (working title).  Again, that's five games, more if you consider drafts rewritten from scratch with significant changes to be separate works.<br/><br/>Part of any analysis I do of their works is going to be colored by personal relationships, but I do believe that both Jon and Shreyas exhibit extremely clear and consistent styles.<br/><br/>Now, it may just be that they're part of a very small sub-group in RPG publishing less worried about finishing and perfecting games for comercial publication, and that the majority of designers simply aren't this prolific (mostly due to sharp focus on current projects, you'll note that many of the games listed above are either extremely simple, incomplete, or both; which is fine, really).  But, for at least some selection of game design, there are people who are producing enough, and doing so in such a distinctive style, that I think auteuristic analysis is possible.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Um, thanks for the props, Thomas.  Yeah, I've got about 10 games in various states of completion written since Game Chef 2005, of which 1 has been published in print. I was hoping to have a couple more out at the last GenCon, but there was the One Product Policy. All of these games are definitely part of an effort to work on the same kinds of problems, something I tried to explain in <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/05/design-theory-enacted.html" rel="nofollow">this post back in May</a>.<br/><br/>I know that I am not alone in this regard. There are a bunch of people who have stacks of games that are playable or almost playable but have not been polished up for print or PDF publication yet. Shreyas has a bunch. So does Daniel Solis (many of them not roleplaying games). John Harper has at least a few.  I'd put down money on Jason Morningstar too.<br/><br/>Plus, there are people in the indie community who already have a significant amount of finished work available.  Take Vincent Baker: <i>Kill Puppies for Satan, Otherkind, Nighttime Animals Save The World, Mechaton, Dogs in the Vineyard,</i> and a handful of others. Or Jared Sorensen. Or Zak Arntson. Or Ron Edwards. Or John Wick. Or Clinton R. Nixon. There are plenty of people with a large body of work, even if portions of it aren't available in print. Emily Care Boss may only have 3 games out now, but I think anyone familiar with her work has the unmistakable sense that she is expressing herself through her games.<br/><br/>So yeah, I don't think you can claim that roleplaying designers don't have enough extant work to be "auteurs." I definitely have a strong sense of the design sensibilities and personal goals of all the people I mentioned above, just from reading and playing their games.                        </div>

                            Ben: Well, sure, I totally hear you on that point. <br/><br/>Maybe instead of authors, there's a french word for tool-maker, implying that they make tools which help authors?  Because, let's be blunt, some RPG Tool-makers suck at their craft, so it's still a worthwhile discussion under any (perhaps another) name.<br/><br/>And even if we call them "fabricant d'outil" or, hell, "Werkzeughersteller", tool makers I think exhibit themselves in the tools they craft.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Hmmmm, Werkzeughersteller.                        </div>

                            (This is a digression into film-crit-land that can be ignored).<br/><br/>Well, here's why we should use a French word when we're talking about the auteur theory (and why we probably shouldn't if we're not).<br/><br/>The theory was developed by Francois Truffaut and his buddies at the Cahiers du cinema (mostly before they were filmmakers themselves) and popularized in America by Andrew Sarris.  The reason to stick with the French word rather than switching to "author" is that these guys were talking about something very specific to filmmaking - and, really, specific to the studio-style filmmaking we associate most closely with 1930s/40s/50s Hollywood.<br/><br/>To simplify (and to a certain extent parody) their argument, Truffaut et al. proposed that certain directors - "auteurs" - were able to sneak their personal vision into the films they were making, despite the fact that they usually didn't write the screenplays, were almost always working under tremendous studio-dictated constraints (with regard to casting, for example), and were often making B-movies for lowbrow audiences.<br/><br/>The auteur theory was not really aimed at filmmakers who we might actually consider the primary authors of their films - like Ingmar Bergman, for example.  (Granted, Truffaut, Rivette, Sarris, etc. all seem to be pretty arbitrary in their judgments of who's an auteur and who isn't).<br/><br/>The theory was criticized almost from the beginning (by Andre Bazin and Pauline Kael, among others).  One of the major points against it was that the authorship of movies - especially the studio movies that the auteur theorists were writing about - is a much more complicated affair.  (See Pauline Kael's "Raising Kane" - a landmark anti-auteur piece).<br/><br/>Now, I think the auteur theory, at least in its strongest form as articulated by Truffaut and Sarris, is bogus, but even if I did buy it, I'd argue that you can't apply it willy-nilly to other kinds of creative endeavors (especially solo-ish ones, like indie-RPG design or singing-songwriting or novel-writing).  Its raison d'etre, after all, lay in the fact that movie-making is a collaborative process and it's often difficult to unravel the specifics of the various participants' creative contributions.  (You might be able to talk about, say, old-time super-hero comics in this way).<br/><br/>But do game designers have a certain personal style that they express from game-to-game - yeah, I think so.                        </div>

                            Ben, Truffaut had the excuse of actually being French, so his saying it in French seems OK to me. Also, he had the excuse of being an artist, so that his theory was really an excuse for doing what he was going to do anyway. When people like he and Godard changed their minds about how they wanted to make movies, they changed how they made movies, and so much the worse for the auteur.<br/><br/>But really, I agree with you. The <em>critics</em> who adopted his manifesto as an actual theory were being really, really dumb. I understand their motivation -- a film is a really complex creative collaboration, and it's just <em>easier</em> to write and think as if the director is the author and the writers, actors, cinematographers, and production designers etc. are the tools the director uses to execute his or her vision. As a critic, you can then adopt all the techniques that you use when analzying a single-author novel. It's easier, but actually supposing the writers, actors, cinematographers and designers are not active creative collaborators is just amazingly dumb.<br/><br/>We don't have to be that dumb.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jon Hastings</cite>To simplify (and to a certain extent parody) their argument, Truffaut et al. proposed that certain directors - "auteurs" - were able to sneak their personal vision into the films they were making, despite the fact that they usually didn't write the screenplays, were almost always working under tremendous studio-dictated constraints (with regard to casting, for example), and were often making B-movies for lowbrow audiences.</blockquote>
An interesting theory.  I don't know if game-designers could be called "auteurs" as much as GMs or maybe even players.  Are there repeating themes that certain GMs or players try to hit in each game despite the system or setting involved?                        </div>

Ben ... how does this square with your stance on things like Creative Commons licensing?<br><br/>On the one hand (licensing), you're saying that the game designer should always maintain ultimate creative control over their games.  Here, you're saying that the designer is, in some sense, irrelevant - that their creations are anti-authorial.<br/><br/>I agree with the second notion (and not the first) - I'm just wondering how you fit the two together.<br/><br/>As for auteurs: Our own Jonathan Walton (already mentioned), Daniel Solis and Jared Sorenson - off the top of my head.  Big catalogues of little games that all show a particular creative 'stamp' as it were.  Do they all need to be published-published in order to count?  Of course not - they're all out there for <i>de facto</i> public consumption.<br/><br/>And that article, with the 'we'll take the mechanics and strip off the theme' attitude of the German publishers gave me the wobblies.<br/><br/>Talk about System Doesn't Matter.                        </br></div>

I agree.  By day, I design video games, and a lot of tabletop RPG discussion tends to cover the same basic ground that I see covered at work.  The conclusions are often different, but many of the core questions are very similar.  Hell, the industry organization is more or less identical: you've got a few major players that dominate the market, and then you've got the indies who are just starting to get a foothold because of the new playing field that technology now affords them.<br/><br/>I think it's cool, but it also gets confusing.  I'll spend the afternoon arguing with someone about game narrative, then I log on to this site or the Forge and someone says something, and I'm like, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?  Then I realize I'm reading something about tabletop, and then I log off and go have a beer.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

                            I doubt we disagree, Jonathon. We'll talk about it over beers.<br/><br/>But, like, part of what we do is total normal historical human stuff (create social structures, make stories, entertain ourselves and others, etc). But there's a lot of unique ways in the way we do things that make it really really hard to say stuff like "Game Designers are auteurs!" or "Roleplaying is structured improv!" or whatever and have it not require a whole lot of qualifiers.<br/><br/>It's not the stuff from other field's isn't relevent....but I think it's of <i>limited use</i> until we figure out how to talk about what we're doing. Which I don't think has happened yet for us in the same way it's happened for theatre or film or dance or fiction writing or improv or acting.                        </div>

                            We'll talk once you learn to spell my name.<br/><br/>But, yeah, we pretty much agree.  However, I think roleplaying might already have a semi-standard framework for discussion if people spent less time reinventing the wheel (which is mind-boggling slow and difficult) and more time reading what other people have already done (where the crap has already been seperated out by hundreds of really smart people). But I guess I'll eventually have to put my money where my mouth is about this stuff.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, I don't want to import this particular idea from film criticism because I think it's a wrong idea, even in the context of film. This isn't me trying to reinvent the wheel, it's me saying that this alleged wheel is <em>square</em>, and doesn't roll.                        </div>

                            Ben,<br/><br/>In your most recent statement did you mean 'adopt' or 'adapt' (you said the latter).  I ask because while I see how adopting terminology from other fields with little or no modification is counter-productive, I'm less clear on how adapting that terminology to a new field is so bad.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>
