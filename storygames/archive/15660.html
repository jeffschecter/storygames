I know the endgame can be triggered pretty quickly if need be (make a character lose all contacts and threaten him), but that seems to be a dull way to end the game. I'd like to see someone reach Rep 10. If you've played/ran the game at a Con, have you played until the endgame and how long did it take? We'll be playing with 3 players and no GM, if that makes a difference. We'd really like for the game to be one-shot (we've got 5ish hours to play).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother, more general question: what tips would you give to someone playing Contenders for the first time?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks yall!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354996/#Comment_354996" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T12:39:37+00:00" title="January 19, 2012 12:39PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly it's probably been 3 years since I played Contenders. But I had some good one-shot sessions and wanted to give some feedback.<br/><br/>Without starting things off "ahead", I'm not sure how easy it's going to be to achieve Rep 10 in one session.<br/><br/>My memory is that the fights can start to get really long. So perhaps a way to keep the fights short and snappy so you can move on and get to the next scene.<br/><br/>Perhaps start everyone off at Rep 4 or 5? <br/><br/>What do my UK friends say??                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354998/#Comment_354998" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T12:44:24+00:00" title="January 19, 2012 12:44PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've played a complete game to explosive Hope-destroying finishes for all involved in nine hours, three, 3-hour play sessions.
