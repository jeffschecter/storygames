I'll list things the players do instead of what the characters do, because most of these things imply equivalent character roles, but some also include important compromises of the medium:<br/><br/><br/><b>Leadership roles</b><br/><br/><b>Strategic leadership ("captain", "Gandalf"):</b> doesn't talk much, pays attention, promulgates theories and strategies, chairs strategic discussions. The guy who collects the GM's clues and pieces together the big picture. Chooses general goals and directions (or, prepares the options and presents them for party discussion). May be combined with tactical leadership in a small party, but surprisingly often isn't.<br/><br/><b>Tactical leadership ("sergeant", "caller"):</b> chooses specific movement patterns and directions, arranges marching orders, hard defensive points, forward scouting, promulgates tactical discipline. Talks a lot, chairs tactical discussions, focuses on immediate fictional space and its tactical use.<br/><br/><b>Face:</b> engages complex interactive situations for the party; this is not strictly limited to social challenges, it's just that social challenges are the most common form of "roleplaying challenge" (which, if we're talking theory, strictly speaking just means stuff where fiction awareness, snap decisions and presentation skills count for a lot). Often the strategic leader is the face as well, because of how the two roles harmonize.<br/><br/><br/><b>Operational roles</b><br/><br/><b>Mapper:</b> engages the mapping discourse with the GM, maintains the various maps, tracks data on space and positioning. (Regardless of which character is actually currently scouting, the same player draws the map.) The tactical leader is often the mapper as well, but it's equally possible that they're not, in which case the mapper should maintain the current record on fictional positioning (who's in the room, who's in the corridor - that sort of thing) for the tactician. The mapper leads search procedures, and they usually navigate for the party when traveling.<br/><br/><b>Logistics officer:</b> records supplies, henchmen and time expenditure, maintains the loot list. Unless subsumed to tactical or strategic leadership, logistics is responsible for communicating logistical constraints such as rest periods and remaining supplies to tactics; where the mapper is responsible for the space record, logistics answers for time. The logistics officer generally coordinates downtime activities for the party, and takes care of buying and selling equipment.<br/><br/><b>Tactical understudy ("corporal"):</b> this may be amusing, but apparently in our parties it is not uncommon for the tactical leader to outsource certain basic tasks to an understudy. Maintaining records on marching order and initiative order (during combat) are classical examples, as is henchman control and tracking. Depends on who's in the lead and what they're doing themselves; if the tactical leader is taking on the mapping duties as well, it's likely that they'll use an understudy for the tactical paperwork.<br/><br/>(Tactical understudies are also used in large parties to provide for more independent action. I'd say that when the party has more than a dozen people in it, it's not unusual for the tactical lead to start splitting the party into two or more squads, each led by an understudy in independent decision-making.)<br/><br/><b>Forward scout ("long recon"):</b> while the tactical leader marches the party as a whole around the dungeon, setting up strong points and whatnot, the other party members are assumed to follow along without the players having to do anything per se. Forward scouts are detached individuals who move independently in the dungeon; a common tactical doctrine in exploration missions is for tactical to set up a strong point and wait with the party in ambush positions while a forward scout goes in for a look-see. Scouting is a very distinctive role, of course, and a demanding one on the player, on par with the leadership roles insofar as intensity of play (and adventure) is concerned.<br/><br/><b>Fool ("of a Tuk"):</b> a character played somewhat jocularly, with little self-preservation instinct. The Fool takes the big and amusing risks for the party, like drinking mysterious potions, pressing buttons, and such. The Fool is often on long or close recon as well, naturally enough, as they're willing to take the risk (if not necessarily competent to do the job well).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451649/#Comment_451649" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-25T15:18:08+00:00" title="February 25, 2016  3:18PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Party train</b><br/><br/><b>Vanguard ("close recon"):</b> usually the strongest or bravest fighter in the party, the close recon marches on the front, breaks into rooms first and leads the formation in battle. Unless the party is using forward scouts to clear the way, they're also the one who walks into pit traps and such first. The tactical lead is often the vanguard as well, implying that they lead from the front like a brave hero should <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(The vanguard is often swapped situationally, so that the best fighter may be vanguard in a break-and-enter situation, while the most expendable party member may be vanguard when somebody needs to stick their hand into a green devil face.)<br/><br/><b>Light carry:</b> as armsmen often prefer to have their hands free for arms, it is usual to designate specific party members responsible for the torches and lanterns. Their role in combat is actually pretty critical, as the light carry, whatever else they're doing in the crisis, should maintain constant lightning for the rest of the party to not get blinded; I've had parties die when the guy holding the only light source forgets about it and declares action that implies that they're dropping the lantern <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><b>Shield carry:</b> a heavy party posture generally involves the use of large, mobile shields, caltrops and other siege equipment. These are semi-mobile arrangements in that they can be moved around at exploration speeds, but not any faster than that. The shield carriers are the characters specifically carrying the heavy equipment; three mantlets with one man each, or two somewhat heavier ones with two men each, are typical arrangements. Some or all of the shield carriers may be henchmen.<br/><br/><b>Non-combat personnel (NCP):</b> party members who are not combat rated, and are in the dungeon to act as porters, diggers, cooks - or for their specialist skills as interpreters, sailors or whatever. Almost always NPCs, but I've certainly played a linguist that the other players absolutely insisted was to be treated as a NCP. NCPs are placed in the center of the marching order, are not used for dangerous or stressful duties, and so on, as one might imagine.<br/><br/><br/><b>Combat roles</b><br/><br/><b>Grunt:</b> most of the PCs are simply along for the ride most of the time, waiting for their time to act. The grunt pool is an available source of "free manpower", so the tactical lead is likely to draw on the grunts to get understudies, scouts and other necessary specialists on an as-needed basis. As free manpower, being a grunt implies not having a special role in the party train (carrying lights, shields, etc.) In combat the grunts fill the melee line.<br/><br/><b>Skirmisher:</b> a combat specialist role that differs from grunts in that a skirmisher fights outside the melee line, in a mobile manner. The party as a whole rarely breaks ranks entirely in dungeon combat for obvious reasons, but sometimes forward scouts or such may adopt skirmishing postures to harass enemy flanks or whatever. Magicians, should we have one that actually has something useful to do in combat, go in this category as well. Missile weapons and "striking from second rank" with spears apply here as well, with the proviso that e.g. I myself am so leery of these particular dungeon combat conventions that they are often suppressed altogether.<br/><br/><b>Combat support:</b> one or two characters not particularly suited to frontline combat are often assigned to less demanding, yet necessary duties by the tactical lead. Maintaining lightning conditions, providing tactical reserves and dragging the injured out of the melee are typical tasks. Often characters with strategic specialties (necessary language skills or whatever) are exempted from front-line melee to increase their survivability.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451651/#Comment_451651" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-25T16:34:58+00:00" title="February 25, 2016  4:34PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (So good to see you're still here, Eero!

If you want to hear about recent news in Finnish indie design, how to play <i>Paranoia</i> for real, or our D&amp;D adventures, then I might have something to contribute.)<br/><br/>Regarding group size, the number of <i>players</i> is usually in the 3-8 range, but the number of <i>troops</i> involved in a dungeon excursion can easily be greater. This is particularly true for <i>Dungeon Crawl Classics</i>, which is where our Helsinki game moved from Mentzer in January - as new characters start on the 0th level and a player is entitled to run <b>four</b> of those simultaneously, we have a crazy number of "player characters" hanging out in that campaign even before adding in the henchmen - assuming we'd want to bring any with that many PCs, of course <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Aside from DCC weirdness, though, it's not that strange for even a low-level party to hire a whole bunch of NPCs to fill in the ranks once the initial financing difficulties are handled. As we usually play with more or less realistic economics, and PCs regularly draw in treasure equaling the annual income of a small village, the biggest limitations to hiring are usually the availability of desperate fools and the attention you draw from the local authorities for assembling a personal army. When I have my druthers, a professional dungeoneering party involves about 30-50 people in total, of which about half go into the dungeon in each excursion. That's the sort of numbers where a single death to a pit trap does not represent a massive moral and tactical blow that calls for an immediate retreat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451654/#Comment_451654" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-25T16:56:46+00:00" title="February 25, 2016  4:56PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, Eero. We had a thread recently which discussed an old-school D&amp;D reframe of the Matrix, where the numbers of available "characters" essentially act as the group's "hit points". They dwindle with characters deaths during missions, and can only be replenished by sexual reproduction (not likely, in a dungeon, and probably too long-term a project to be undertaking) or by raiding more "bodies" from the Overlords.<br/><br/>Watching those numbers, and having capable people available for various missions, would be key to long-term success in this kind of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451655/#Comment_451655" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-25T17:08:47+00:00" title="February 25, 2016  5:08PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a fun logistical challenge, I can appreciate that - certainly much more dynamic of a feel for a resistance movement than the one in the Matrix movies, where the overall impression is that nothing much is really happening aside from Jesus and his magical quest. It'd be fun to balance the various strategic needs against each other, as well as the political pressure to hasten the "liberation" of the population, including people who might not be that useful for military purposes.<br/><br/>You'd absolutely want to design the "free a person from the Matrix" mission environment to be robust as all fuck, as it'd be such a repeated strategic goal. You could go with the idea that there are all sorts of people-prison facilities with different layouts and tactical penetration concerns - but I think that I would rather go with a basically repeating mission structure on that side, and make the in-Matrix action the unexpected part with all the variety; perhaps you can't kidnap people out of the Matrix before prepping them in the correct manner inside the illusion, or something like that.<br/><br/>Reminds me of the classic tactical skirmish computer game <i>UFO: Enemy Unknown</i>, which would also provide a similar grand strategy environment with high lethality for a D&amp;D-like wargamish rpg: you'd have your funding and political consensus for an Earth defense operation, a certain capability for tapping national defense forces for personnel, and then everything you do hinges on being able to form and operate highly competent commando teams against weird aliens with unknown capabilities. Losing personnel causes political issues, and of course the stock you'll have available mostly only grows worse as you get our best and the brightest killed in the line of duty.<br/><br/>All this of course is pretty similar to how our attempts at tackling major dungeons end up. At the most extreme you end up hiring a muster officer for the company, whose sole function is to hang out in the local towns to hire up more poor bastards for the "adventure" on-going in the yonder wilderness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451656/#Comment_451656" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-25T17:23:08+00:00" title="February 25, 2016  5:23PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Yeah, that's exactly my thinking behind the "Matrix-esque" frame for a dungeon crawl. However, I find the idea that human bodies are used as some sort of "batteries" for electrical energy entirely ludicrous, so instead, in our version, the bodies act as hosts for the parasite creature. Eventually it takes them over and they "awaken" as Overlords, their human brain stem completely destroyed or corrupted.<br/><br/>This adds a neat wrinkle, in that it's possible to rescue these humans with doing all the prepwork (locating them via the illusion, and so forth), but then the danger is that the human rescued has a live parasite inside them and may eventually be "taken over" by the larva growing inside its brain. It makes them a ticking time bomb.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451658/#Comment_451658" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-25T17:31:27+00:00" title="February 25, 2016  5:31PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, that's exactly my thinking behind the "Matrix-esque" frame for a dungeon crawl.
