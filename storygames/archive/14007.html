About a dozen people, plus us, were there. It occurred to me that Remi and I could probably rock two tables of Dungeon World on the spot, despite having zero prep. It further occurred to me that if we had two tables of six, we could <i>swap players</i> periodically. So we put our heads together, created a vague backstory (the evil and teleport-happy wizard-king Radithor dispatches two groups of adventurers to deal with problems in the north and south of his kingdom), and jumped right in. <br/><br/>So in the north there was a mysterious plague and in the south there were menacing supernatural giants. Every so often Radithor would teleport adventurers into the opposite group and we'd swap players - usually it'd be Ranger for Ranger or whatever, but early on I ended up with two wizards - both elves, who Sam and George immediately decided were brothers. It was so much fun. The wizard's "oftener right" move is totally killer.<br/><br/>The GM end was pure improvisation, which Dungeon World handles well. There's so much player agency that you can't plan much anyway. The character/player swapping was pretty fun, and introduced unexpected elements - I lost a peaceful, nature-loving bard and got some kind of insane chaos rock star in her place, for example. I ginned up a menacing frog god and a glamorous witch and Remi had his party doing really crazy stuff (at least the fragmentary reports from the characters plucked out of his adventure were crazy). <br/><br/>It was light-hearted and made for a great evening.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317340/#Comment_317340" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-21T06:17:48+00:00" title="March 21, 2011  6:17AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds really neat!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317372/#Comment_317372" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-21T10:44:22+00:00" title="March 21, 2011 10:44AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

It was especially nice to be able to play with almost everyone at the party. Also, the occasional pauses to reset and explain what was happening to the newly switched people helped keep the fiction at least somewhat sensible. I was letting my imagination go crazy, so this occasional sanity check was very good for keeping things from flying off into Cloud Cuckoo Land.<br/><br/>As for the TPK, well . . . the characters had ice-amulets, given to them by the Air Nomad, that kept them protected from the flaming apocalypse around Firesson the Giant. They inserted said amulets into the star in the Firesson's head to kill the giant, freeing Stormsson's son's soul from Crom Cruach, and saving the valley, the village and Radithor. Unfortunately, this left them exposed to the incredible heat of a star for a moment before it went out, charring them all into their component atoms. I was happy to see no one held back their amulets, plunging them into the star with little hesitation. True Heroes! <br/><br/>I feel like the biggest mistake I made was giving -1-continuous to the party for blowing a Perilous Journey roll. It just slowed things down and frustrated the party, so boo on me for that. Occasional bad effects from being tired (say, on other blown rolls) would have been better than a super-boring -1.<br/><br/>I loved Chris's not-a-dick Paladin. That said, he lit up with bloodthirsty glee when he finally found some evil bastard goblins to slay.<br/><br/>Jason had all his players start their names with 'A' and requested that all my players start their names with 'B'.

The DM starts the round by framing the scene and making a general Move or two (announcing badness being the most likely).  Then the spotlight goes around the table (using a regular rotation or by rolling initiative, if you must) giving each player a chance to take action and make moves. Those moves might also result in an additional DM Move, depending on their outcome (a failure, for example).<br><br>I think the point is that damage from monsters and traps doesn't need to be directly connected to a DM Move- it can and should happen as a matter of circumstance, a repeatable consequence from a previous DM Move.<br><br><small>Sorry for the derail.

AW certainly is a harsh mistress, but not sure Dungeon World should have the ame desperation feeling for helping... <br>\n<br>\n___<br>\njason L                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317589/#Comment_317589" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T11:19:44+00:00" title="March 23, 2011 11:19AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When exposed to danger it means the danger the person you're helping is exposed to.
