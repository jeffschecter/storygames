Like so many other folks seem to be doing these days, I'm writing a hack for Apocalypse World. I figured you guys might know a thing or two about that.<br/><br/>When Greg Stolze started a <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?712915-UA-So-Unknown-Armies-might-reboot-in-2015" rel="nofollow">thread on RPGnet about the possibility of a 2015 reboot for Unknown Armies</a>, a few people said "hey Greg, you should make it into an Apocalypse World hack." And at first I laughed. But then I realised, if there was an AW hack that could capture the feel of UA - the obsession, and the panic, and the occult bullshit - I'd play the hell out of it.<br/><br/>And then, I started tinkering with the idea, and with the help of some clever friends, it's all falling into place. It hasn't been playtested at all, but <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?714431-Unknown-Armies-Apocalypse-World-The-World-Of-Our-Desires" rel="nofollow">here's the RPGnet thread</a> where I've posted the moves and playbooks.<br/><br/>If you've got any feedback, advice, or contributions, I'd love to hear 'em!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
