This game doesn\u2019t need a computer or games console though, just a group of friends with some dice, pencils, tokens and a stock of interesting pictures...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk/Mini-Games/" rel="nofollow">In Camera (post Indiemeet 2nd draft)</a>: This is a game that's meant to capture the style &amp; tone of films likes The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity and Apollo 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first two rounds of play, everyone creates cameras, using them to introduce locations or characters that will appear frequently in the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn subsequent rounds of play, each player can direct an event: during this, a deck of cards is used to pace the event, with red cards equating to light or positive situations and black cards equating to dark or negative ones. The director of the scene has a small hand of cards to hand out to the other players, facing their characters with an appropriate situation as he does so, but the director can make use of the cameras in the scene to 'edit' the footage with cuts, pans and zooms, changing the cards he has and therefore the situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a reciprocal process in action, in that players decide how their characters respond to the situation they are dealt and this decision feeds back into the cards that are available in later events, weighting them towards light or dark content.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348857/#Comment_348857" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-14T03:36:01+00:00" title="November 14, 2011  3:36AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk/Laboratory/" rel="nofollow">The Final Voyage of The Selene:</a> I liked <b>Witch: the Road to Lindisfarne</b> so much that I've been inspired to have a got at writing my own guided narrative-style freeformish game; this is a first draft of an attempt at a tale of a disaster in space, beginning from the start of a voyage from the frontier of human space and ending just when the ship had almost made it back to Earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't quite finished: in particular, you will look in vain for the Roles and Agendas mentioned in the game, as I haven't finished them yet, but I'd still appreciate any feedback on the basic play-structure and the tone of the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348890/#Comment_348890" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-14T11:33:48+00:00" title="November 14, 2011 11:33AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've added a very important page to the website: <b>Game Texts</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're curious about one of my games, but downloading and printing out the pdf seems like a chore, you can check out the full text on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk/Game-Texts/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, the only game available in this format is <b>The Final Voyage of the Selene</b> but I will make others available on request.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Toad" title="Mr Toad"><img alt="Mr Toad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Toad">Mr Toad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348919/#Comment_348919" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T01:31:58+00:00" title="November 15, 2011  1:31AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Final Voyage of the Selene looks awesome James.

This is for faster, lighter, indier play (Indier? Did I just make that word up?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if you're curious, have a copy of Paranoia and would like a rules-lite option for play, you can download it <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk/Miscellaneous/" rel="nofollow">here.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
