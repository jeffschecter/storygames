                    Disclaimer: This post quotes the use of several derogatory slurs, which were spoken "in character" during games. If you feel like you might be offended by racial slurs or attacks on queer identity, skip the blocked quotes.<br/><br/>So, in several games I've played in, players have narrated in some stuff which has shocked me and made me stumble. The following have come up in games I've played:<br/>-ethnic cleansing<br/>-rape<br/>-racial prejudices<br/>-hate crimes<br/><br/>I've got two examples I want to share, because examples are easier to talk about that abstracts.
<blockquote> I'm playtesting carry with a group of people I've pulled together - a d&amp;d friend, an 'old skooler' that I've never gamed with, and some n00bs. The game is set in Vietnam and there are several black squad members.<br/><br/>One scene is set in the mess hall. Two new members had just been added to the squad, and they were generally disliked and excluded. Tensions built around the table, until Steve-O's character jumped up, pulled out a knife, and yelled "shut the fuck up, nigger. Shut up or I'll shut you up." And there was this stunned silence on my part, and I stutter a bit. I want to go back and censor what he's saying, for some strange reason. The narration is fitting and powerful, but he's bringing race into the equation for crying out loud!<br/><br/>Steve-O was the only one around the table who wasn't white. And so now the people who might respond seem to be thinking, "So, is it okay for ME to say racist things in character as well? Or is it not okay? Wait, was it okay for him to in the first place?"<br/><br/>It felt like Steve-O had introduced the issue at a player level as well as a character level.<br/></blockquote>
So, I'm asking about a few things which all get jumble together on this issue, I think.<br/>I'm asking, "How are lines effectively drawn on issues like prejudice and hate crime?"<br/>I'm also asking, "How do you introduce to the table such sensitive elements of narration?"<br/>I'm also asking, "Should people even introduce stuff like this? Are there places where it is/isn't appropriate?"<br/>I'm also pointing out that I seem to have a sensitivity to it, whereas things like self-abuse and violence don't affect me in narration.
<blockquote>So, we're playing a Sorcerer game set in high school right now, and I'm playing a closet-gay sorcerer, who's been forced onto the track team by his father. My kicker was that a track member says "way to fuck up the [baton] pass, fag". (He means "fag" in the high-school version, which is synonymous with "dick" and "loser" and any other generic insult possible.) And when he says this, it triggers my character to flip out, ram his face into a mirror, and then get into a full on fight with him.<br/><br/>And I totally kick his ass because I'm a Sorcerer with a Stamina-boosting demon, and he isn't. And I am like, "rock!"<br/><br/>And then later that night, after the game ended and I went home, I was thinking back. First of all, would I have been okay with that scene if the gay character had been beaten up by the straight person? No, I wouldn't have been. It's not that I am not okay with my character getting beaten up, in general - it's that I'm not okay with the gay character getting beaten up on the grounds of being gay. I don't want a story about how the heteronormative world beats down on another queer kid. If that story had started happening, I would have been upset.<br/><br/>The other thing I realized is that I was asking other players to play prejudiced, homophobic kids. I was saying, "here, I will be the minority, and you beat on me, and I will win because I am a sorcerer with a mighty demon." I mean, obviously I wasn't saying that directly, but my flags were PRETTY clear about it.<br/><br/></blockquote>
So, yeah. That's my more recent story.<br/><br/>I have a bunch more questions that springboard from that.<br/><br/>Is my one-way-streetism an unfounded, unreasonable thing?<br/>Am I being unfair to the other players by asking them to take on hateful, prejudiced roles? They take on the roles of killers and orcs and nightmares in other games, but is this somehow different?<br/><br/><br/>....Ultimately, I don't have a single, directed point here. I'm just saying "omg, I have no idea how to handle this and it's such a sensitive topic that I have a hard time getting my head around it - also, I take identity politics and oppression and hate crime very, very seriously, and how do I do this kind of thing justice?"<br/><br/>So, yeah. I want to understand how you integrate, avoid, or approach issues like this in your games. examples would be helpful.                </div>

                            I'm anticipating a good amount of discussion about this once people start to play Grey Ranks.  There's a pretty strong "don't play this if!" disclaimer, and the line and veil discussion is hard-wired into character generation, but still, that's all good until the mass executions, rape squads, and child torture start to crop up.  <br/>
<br/>
Is it OK to shoot a Nazi in the face?  Is it OK to shoot a seventeen-year-old Wehrmacht soldier in the face?  Is it OK to shoot a Polish Verbrennungskommando laborer in the face for being a collaborator?  Anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Clinton, Remi and I have dealt with race directly a couple of times, although also a little obliquely - I suggested we set our PTA cop show in Cincinnati, Ohio, for example, and they chose to play a Vietnamese guy and a Cuban guy, respectively.  The fact that there is a black underclass wasn't denied but it was sorta ignored, which is interesting - we set up vicious Asian gangs along racial lines (Vietnamese and Cambodian) and they were the focus of play.  Remi's character was gay and that was an important part of the game, and never really became difficult to address.  <br/>
<br/>
I think besides the obvious trust and communication necessary to approach these issues, there's always an unconscious measurement of collective comfort level that goes on.                        </div>

I think there's no point thinking like this. There's no point thinking "What if I'd said that instead of him?" or "What if the gay character had been beaten up?".<br/><br/>It's your game, not anyone else's. You're a group of people, playing a game, and the game is part of your social interaction. <br/><br/>So, like any social interaction, some things are OK for one person to say, but not for another. Some things are acceptable to one group of people, but not another.<br/><br/>You're under no obligation to say things that would be OK for <i>any other person</i> to say; or to play a game that would be acceptable for <i>any other group</i> to play. It's your game. If it's cool with everyone present, then it's OK.<br/><br/>Does some of that make sense? I'm not trying to dismiss your post. I'm just saying: the game consists of people interacting, so if we're talking about whether something's acceptable, we must consider who the people involved actually are. <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<blockquote><br/>-ethnic cleansing<br/>-rape<br/>-racial prejudices<br/>-hate crimes</blockquote>
I'll just say that an awesome way NOT to do it is to NOT have a "veils and lines" discussion when it pops up.  Now, racial prejudice aside (because that one seems to have caught you off-guard), as soon as any of the others start to creep up, I'd totally have been like "Woah woah woah, hold up a sec..." and had at least an EXTREMELY brief pow-wow on <i>what I'm cool with and what I'm not cool with</i>.<br/><br/>Ex: I tend to do a lot more adventure gaming, so the above rarely made their way into sessions I've run or played in, if ever. I think there was some racial stuff in a UA campaign I ran a few years back, but I have hazy memories of it, and it didn't really involve expletives so much as 'tensions'.<br/><br/>However, I do remember well when I joined my frat-bro's AD&amp;D campaign back in college for two sessions. They were playing twice a week for the entirety of the summer, they wanted me to join, and I totally wanted to play. The DM was towing the line of "Hey, I'm just the DM, I'm ambivalent about morality and will let you do what you want; but if your character does stupid things, then bad stuff will happen to them".  So I made a female Al-Qadim wandering thief and acrobat-type... who got raped by a pirate captain in the second session. Even worse, actually; got her achilles tendon sliced while being raped because she was fighting back. It all came about because the characters were stuck in the brig of a pirate ship, and I decided that I would "seduce" the captain without backup. A few bad rolls later, she was cut up and being raped. (note: It was a table of approx 6 (7?) folks, with two women players. They didn't seem put off, really, but I think they definitely had a "this is only a game anyway" mindset)<br/><br/>Again, it totally fit the 'Hey, that was a bold and stupid move, trying to go off on your own; you're not even a fighter type, so you just got what was natural in those circumstances, etc" mindset of the DM. But this was before I even began to fathom that "lines and veils" was something that sometimes needed to be discussed. In any case, I was pretty disgusted with the turn of events (even though the DM had another person in the brig, when the thief was dumped back into it, give her a healing potion to fix the achilles' heel). I even decided that, heck, I was OK with that as long as we can drum up some revenge sideplot, but it was clear that that wasn't going to happen (the pirate ship was just an interlude bit connecting a few adventures, and the DM didn't plan on having it make an appearance). So I ended up making up an excuse and leaving the group after that second session.<br/><br/>Even knowing what I know now, I think something like this would have happened:<br/><br/>1) As soon as the DM made it clear that my character was in real danger of rape, I would have interjected a discussion of "Hey, I totally don't want to go there". If the DM emphasized that "that's what you get for botching your plans to take out the captain", I probably would have tried to derail things, or retcon it so that it wouldn't happen: "Hey, this is fantasy, I don't want rape in my leisure game, ok? If that's was on the table when this started, I totally would never have engaged in that foolish plan anyway". I really think the DM would have been cool with that (in other words, retconning so that I was just "sitting in the brig"), but I probably would have had warning lights go off that would have started me down the road of looking for another group anyway. I've never been too interested in games where "sitting in a brig" was the Best Choice You Could Make.<br/><br/>2) If we had gotten to the middle of the rape bit (it wasn't too graphic, BTW, but the achilles heel thing was graphic, and that was kind of the crowning turd), I wouldn't have suddenly derailed things with a discussion of how horrible the game is, or that the DM went too far, etc. I probably would have did what I did before, and just not said anything and simply drop out after that session.<br/><br/>Kind of a lose-lose situation any way you look at it, but I wasn't too attached to the game anyway; I was just bored because it was a hot summer, I was a dorm RA for that summer, and was looking for a good RPG to throw down. I eventually got a Vampire game going instead.<br/><br/>In any case, I often have the lines/veils discussion at convention games (especially if a risque/sexy scene is coming up), but otherwise by my own mental wirings it's simply never an option to have rape in my games; it will simply never happen. Like a knife fight in Katamari Damacy, it's simply not in the programming.  The only way to get that experience from one of my games is, as a player, to stop the action and say "Hey, I totally want that guy to rape my character". And even then, after carefully deciding, I'd probably just say "OK, <i>that happens</i>. Next scene..."<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Two weeks ago in our TSOY/Firefly game we had a situation where we had to get 20 orphans from one spaceship to the other without vac suits.  Total <i>2001 </i>moment.  Reavers inbound.  Very tense.  We worked out the grim logistics of the thing and then somebody said "OK, let's see how many of them die!"<br/><br/>And I said "None of them die."<br/><br/>And it was a little surprising, even to me, because that group is well-established and we have a pretty well-defined social contract that wouldn't normally allow that sort of objection.  But I found myself feeling pretty powerfully that I didn't want to go there, and I articulated that, and it was OK.                        </div>

                            I actually see this in <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> more than a bit, since it's quite possible to put ethnicity, culture groups, gender, and sexual preference in as thematic batteries.  Those are some examples in the book, even.  Once you do so, you are pretty explicitly saying, "I want everybody at the table to keep referencing these batteries, and I understand that said references will be all over the board."  So if you put <em>Indian</em> on your sheet, you are nearly guaranteed to have racial stereotypes thrown at you.  If you take a battery for <em>Closet Homosexual</em> (which I will, one day, get to play), there will be buggery "jokes."  There will also, by the rules of situation creation, be situations that are prepped by the GM where Indian Colonists are being casually exploited, where a homosexual governor is being blackmailed, or where one or both is getting the shit beaten out of them because of who they are.<br/><br/>Now, at least in this game, if you don't want any of that, the solution is simple: take a different thematic battery.  Your character can be Indian or closeted without it being a battery.  Play will go on and will focus on whatever you put in the batteries, which will also mean that it won't focus on your ethnic or gender identity.  It's like the <em>Facts of Life:</em> you take the good and you take the bad.<br/><br/>Another, smaller point, is that the game is pretty hardwired for bad first, good later.  So there's always a hump to get over, but all the crap you suffered through usually pays off, which can be gratifying.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, though: I love ethnicity and gender in the thematic batteries.  When I prepped for my convention games, I had a Scot, an Indian, and a Martian colonist.  So the players didn't write these thematic batteries, I did, but for the most part they chose the characters based on those batteries.  At GenCon SoCal, I watched in each of my four games as the players slowly came to the understanding that yes, it was acceptable and it was even encouraged by the rules to make some remark about the curry-eating wog.  The game is set in the Victorian era, where racism is an unremarked commonplace, and this replicated that sense at the table.  Taken in a modern context, a lot of what was said and done would be <em>horrific</em>, but in the context of the game, bound pretty securely by the game procedures, it was par for the course and good narrative grist.<br/><br/>Which is what I think I'm sort of stumbling towards in my comment, here.  I'm thinking that rules can provide a "safe space" under which this sort of content is rendered acceptable to the players at the table.  Sure, the characters in the game will react how they will, but it's understood that the otherwise offensive content is used <em>in the game</em> and has no literal referrent outside of the game.                        </div>

                            I personally really enjoy putting some real-life elements of race, class, etc. into my gaming.  Part of that's probably because I come from a multi-racial family so seeing things through different "lenses" of Black/White/Asian comes naturally to me.  In fact, sometimes it's an important part of the setting, and I'd feel unsatisfied if it never came up.  I mean, if you're playing a Star Trek game then we're all one big human family, but on our modern Earth, cultural difference and clashes are a very significant part of life.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, sexual victimization and gaybashing make me uneasy.  I'd definitely need to feel comfortable in a game before going there, and I'm mostly just as happy not going there.<br/>
<br/>
This all by way of saying that everybody's got their own comfort zones.  You have to own your own fun and your own comfort, and I think you have to check in on other people and not presume.<br/>
<br/>
To speak directly to your two very interesting examples, Joe, Steve-O was pretty clearly saying with his play that he wanted racism to be part of the game.  You couldn't tell from that one piece of in-character dialogue <i>how </i>or <i>how much </i>he wanted it to be part of the game, though.  That's where the talking comes in.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: And it strikes me that this is probably something I should be prepared to discuss with my players in the online PTA game I'm starting -- we've got cop PC's of three ethnic groups in a racially divided city, and two of them are really flagging the racial issues hard, since his character is basically a token black cop gone soft on the job and his angry young black ex-partner.                        </div>

                            OK, I'm going to share an incident here from many years back.  Perhaps not coincidentally, I posted recently on my LJ an entry <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/45360.html" rel="nofollow"><b>On Orientalism</b></a>.  <br><br>So, in the Ripper campaign, Chris and Alex were the co-GMs.  It was a horror game set in Victorian London around the time of the Jack the Ripper murders.  Fu Manchu appeared as a villain in this -- working within a gang in Chinatown.  I was playing Inspector Benjamin Grimmond, a violent and bullying white policemen who worked in the East End.  Now, going into Chinatown, he had encountered an elderly shopkeeper in whose shop we had found some information.  <br><br>Grimmond wanted to send a message to Fu Manchu, or basically was just feeling antsy.  So after they left, he slipped back to the shop and interrogated the shopkeeper.  The shopkeeper apparently only spoke Chinese, and he severely beat the elderly man demanding answers, eventually not bothering to ask questions.  This was a bit of a turning point, because two of the other players and Chris as GM were uncomfortable with Grimmond at this point.  <br><br>I think an adventure or two later, Grimmond was captured by a bunch of Chinamen in a carriage in classic Fu Manchu style.  He was tortured horribly by Fu Manchu, who made a speech to him about revenge for killing his man. Now, what I felt very strongly at the time was that Grimmond was <i>right</i>.  If his beating of the shopkeeper angered the villainous Fu Manchu to revenge, he felt all the more justified in his actions.  Indeed, given how all of Chinatown was Fu Manchu's territory, I think his racism fit.  However, Grimmond was a major arguing point between me and Chris -- and we had heated arguments outside of the game about it.  <br><br>Now, I hadn't seen it in quite this light at the time -- but here was me as an Asian playing a white cop beating a Chinese NPC.  And I think the existance of Fu Manchu as a villain was at the heart of this.  Chris understood Fu Manchu as a racist caricature, but for the horror game he had him in there, with a bit of humorous irony.  However, I think Grimmond's actions were my way of driving the racism of Fu Manchu home.  Because given Fu Manchu and the Yellow Peril, it <i>is</i> OK to bash Chinamen.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote>Joe, something to add to the pot here...<br/><br/><br/>Steve-O was the only one around the table who wasn't white. And so now the people who might respond seem to be thinking, "So, is it okay for ME to say racist things in character as well? Or is it not okay? Wait, was it okay for him to in the first place?"<br/><br/><br/>I think there's no point thinking like this. There's no point thinking "What if I'd said that instead of him?" or "What if the gay character had been beaten up?".<br/></blockquote>
(Note: take everything I say with a pinch of salt, or some lenience, or whatever, please. I'm having trouble articulating my issue, and might accidentally put my foot in my mouth while trying to do so.)<br/><br/>Graham,<br/><br/>This is exactly what I'm having trouble with, and your "there's no point thinking like this" comment kind of skips over my entire struggle. My struggle is this: when race/sexuality/class get attacked in character, people at the table (at least, the ones I've gamed with) can get very quiet, fidgety, or offended. Prejudice and exploitation are extremely hard to swallow when they come up in narration. Saying something racist, even if removed from it through your character, feels racist.<br/><br/>And when it comes to racial/prejudicial slurs, I do find myself very sensitive to who they are coming from.<br/><br/>For example, if one of my queer friends were to call me a fag, or "fence-sitter", then I wouldn't be upset - it'd be in jest, and they'd be in a position where they I feel they could jest about it. If the average person called me a fag or something, I'd be offput. I'd wonder who they thought they were, and what right they thought they had, to say that. <br/><br/>Thus, as a white, male, English-speaker, I don't feel very comfortable narrating in prejudices and slurs towards groups that have traditionally been marginalized, exploited or attacked by white, male, English-speakers (or any combination of those elements). I'd feel more comfortable playing someone who was racist TOWARDS white people than I would be playing someone who was a white racist.<br/><br/>Whether that line of thinking is rational, irrational, badwrong or what... I'm not sure. Frankly, I'd rather not debate that in this thread too much. That is part of how I react to racism/prejudice, and given that, I want to figure out how to, or not to, explore racism/prejudice in games.<br/><br/>Thanks for the AP-esque responses, guys.                        </div>

                            Joe, for what it's worth, I've don't seem to have any lines these days. Nothing seems to shock or offend me any more, and I probably laugh at things I shouldn't. I think what I've done is to cultivate a detached state of mind, because the world is so full of pain and injustice that it will drive you mad to take it all to heart.<br/><br/>Every crisis is an opportunity. If a roleplaying game is an extended conversation, your friend's clanger is a point for you to make, one way or another. It's a point for him, too. Remember you're teaching each other.<br/><br/>That's how I cope.                        </div>
