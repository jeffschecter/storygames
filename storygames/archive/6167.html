A book in the bargain section caught my eye. I flipped through about 10 pages and immediately bought it. After reading the first 20 or so pages today, I think I've discovered one of the best non-gaming books for gamers.<br/><br/>The book is called Guide to the World's Greatest Treasures and Amazon has used copies for as low as $3. The whole premise is just a quick reference run down of 40 or so real life legendary artifacts. There's at least one full color picture for each entry and the entries are bullet pointed with sections like "What is it?", "What powers does it have?", "How was it lost?", and "Where is it now?"<br/><br/>You can seriously open the book to any page and be presented with the plot of an adventure story. Three of the four Indiana Jones films involve recovering/discovering ancient artifacts and all three of those artifacts are featured in this book!<br/><br/>Need a plot for a night of gaming? Flip open the book, find a fascinating entry, then decide who stole it, who's looking for it, or who wants to use it to take over the world!<br/><br/>It's uses for pulpy games like SoTC should be rather obvious.<br/><br/>-Jarvis<br/>P.S.
