The lack of split scenes just feels really momentum killing for me, and the system assumptions lead to  open-ended long-form campaigns, and I think that sets up games for failure. ( see more thoughts here: <a href="https://plus.google.com/112165300112510479765/posts/GnJ9LWJHP32" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/112165300112510479765/posts/GnJ9LWJHP32</a> ) But that's just my take!<br/><br/>Storium still seems plenty active: <a href="https://storium.com/games/active" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://storium.com/games/active</a> lists 100 games that updated today, and 340 games that updated in the last week. That is a big community! You can see that 160 games were last active in February, but alas you can't mine back further. That's not including private games, which I'm guessing add some to the total, but probably a doubling is as big as I'd guess.<br/><br/>My guess is that there are less people around than the opening.<br/><br/>The finances are even more wild speculation, but if you take a reasonable estimate of how many unique players there are per game that have been active in the last month, and assume every one of them will pay for a subscription when the year comes around, you get a number which is more then enough to keep the lights on, but probably not enough to have much staff. That said, they may have other revenue streams (education), and they may be able to make a big push when the first wave of yearly memberships expire.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443836/#Comment_443836" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T22:24:55+00:00" title="March  8, 2015 10:24PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen any "open" games?<br/>Or played in one of them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443842/#Comment_443842" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-09T02:40:24+00:00" title="March  9, 2015  2:40AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are open games, for sure!

In my personal experience, the attrition rate (the loss of players or post frequency) on games is really, really high. It seems like such a nice approach, and the system feels okay, but the games I've played in have all died on the vine. Players or narrators just walk away.\ufeff They last perhaps five or six scenes, then fizzle out.<br/><br/>For example (if you have a Storium account, you can follow the links), yesterday I went to Games Looking for Players section to look for new games:<br/><a href="https://storium.com/games/open" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://storium.com/games/open</a><br/><br/>I chose the third game down, then checked the game history of the narrator. His last game run is here:<br/><a href="https://storium.com/game/the-last-hope/chapter-2/scene-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://storium.com/game/the-last-hope/chapter-2/scene-2</a><br/><br/>His last game lasted a few scenes, stalled out, picked up, then stalled out last November. The players checked in via chat in January, but the game never picked up again.<br/><br/>This happens often in Storium. I can't tell if it's the game system, the website, the people it attracts, what. But I do this often, look for a game, then check out how long the narrator's last game lasted before it died, and this is something I see.\ufeff<br/><br/>The lack of split scenes is a killer. You get a single player holding up the action and the whole thing falls apart. Especially since challenges laid out by the narrator frequently require cards played by all of the players.<br/><br/>I want to love Storium. But I'm finding all my PBP fun at other sites instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444013/#Comment_444013" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-13T00:09:18+00:00" title="March 13, 2015 12:09AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks a lot for the info! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>A few more questions:<br/>Does anyone have numbers regarding Storium?<br/>Like... how many registered users are there?

So if I'm (+) Strong and (-) Overconfident, then I've got to make 3 card plays each which are Strong or Overconfident (or include my asset or goal). If I can't, then I get one wild card for each to sort of paper through, and then I'm back to shoehorning in Strong or Overconfident.<br/><br/>Sometimes the situation at hand works well with playing to your *one* strength over and over again. And sometimes it doesn't, and you're being constrained into writing posts, or dodging challenges until something fits. But of course, it's easy for GMs to set up challenges which require everybody to contribute so, good luck on that dodging.<br/><br/>I think why a lot of games burn out quickly is that they'll be like 5 players, they create 5 interesting characters, and then it's very easy, it's not even neglectful GMing, to come up with a situation where the first two scenes have nothing at all to do with some character's strengths or weaknesses.<br/><br/>The idea of balancing positive and negative outcomes through a card deck is pretty great! <br/><br/>The idea of constraining fictional outcomes via your player's goals, strengths, and weaknesses is...interesting.<br/><br/>The idea that a player should from the start, play again and again and again to that they have cybernetic arms is, not great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444286/#Comment_444286" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T15:19:32+00:00" title="March 19, 2015  3:19PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2015 3:19PM by James_Stuart.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe put simpler: if you want a desired fictional outcome (success or failure), it is often in your best interest not to post and to hope other people do.<br/><br/>If you respect the nature of your cards, it is often in your best interest not to post and wait for a conflict that'll fit them better.<br/><br/>The combination of those together is a lot of reasons not to post, or to feel awkward when posting.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444289/#Comment_444289" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T16:07:29+00:00" title="March 19, 2015  4:07PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All VERY interesting thoughts... keep 'em rolling <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444294/#Comment_444294" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T17:02:08+00:00" title="March 19, 2015  5:02PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you respect the nature of your cards, it is often in your best interest not to post and wait for a conflict that'll fit them better.<br/><br/>The combination of those together is a lot of reasons not to post, or to feel awkward when posting.</blockquote>\nIronically, I get to bust out one of my favourite quotes here:<br/><br/>"The only winning move is not to play."<br/><br/>Which is pretty poor mechanical design, I think it's safe to say.<br/><br/>Part of the problem from my perspective with way that Storium requires you to engage with the GM (and as the GM) is that you really don't have any freedom of choice in how you deal with an ongoing threat. That ongoing threat includes "the story itself." You have very few cards which will help you, you have a couple more cards which will not help you but could get you more cards if you played them right, and you have absolutely no other way to engage with mechanics of the system to be involved in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>Add to that no one wants to "be responsible" for failing a challenge \u2013 even though playing your Weaknesses to early challenges is absolutely the best tactical use of those cards. If the GM is following the advice provided by others as to how to run a game in Storium, they have provided challenges which require sufficient cards for everyone to be involved, because the basic idea is for everyone to be involved. You get into a situation where no one wants to be "that guy," but the mechanics demand that someone \u2013 and in many cases multiple people \u2013 be "that guy." It's a recipe for stagnation.<br/><br/>There's an additional problem in that there is no feedback on what is reasonable pacing for bringing your resources into play. You can't reasonably guess when your cards are going to recharge, when you're going to an opportunity to get an extra, or even when the scene is going to end and thus judge how many resources you'll have for the next scene because of the previously discussed problems with completing challenges in the scene. If you are playing aggressively, as they say in the bro-shooters "playing the objective," and actively working to fulfill challenges \u2013 you get actively punished by being way down in card leverage and surrounded by people who don't want to be "that guy." It really only works when everyone is playing very aggressively, but there's no way to know or reassurance that doing so will pay off in the next scene, from the perspective of having resources enough to engage with it aggressively.<br/><br/>Storium makes the broader mistake of effectively putting a mechanical system on a messaging forum which is effectively meaningless. Because the system depends entirely on the GM to introduce resource refreshment and provides very little guideline on when and how to do that, you get a lot of games that start up with very enthusiastic people, you go through the first couple of scenes, and you have a bunch of people who are now readily disillusioned because none of them know where to go \u2013 they're stuck in a hole, including the GM. There are no effective pacing mechanisms.<br/><br/>Storium would have been a better design if, from the beginning, it had been conceived more along the lines of the way that play-by-post forums for evolving storylines are usually played: GM-less, with shared responsibility for introducing both threat and opportunity of all the people at the table. The limitation of maintaining only a single strand of narrative in one place at one time is just as bewildering. If you've ever seen forum-based-play, you know that it defines a tree structure, sometimes with a main trunk and branching stories off the side with scenes occurring in multiple places, sometimes with side-scenes being more interesting than the stuff that was important when the game started. Is there any real support for that kind of context management? Absolutely not.<br/><br/>It's not like these are new objections. These the same ones that I had and voiced when Storium was being held up as the next shining light in RPG design. I wasn't alone in doing so, but it certainly felt like it at some points. A year on, and I definitely have no qualms about enjoying my schadenfreude.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that there is the skeleton of a good mechanical resolution system hidden in Storium. I firmly believe that there is an architecture for a play-by-post system hidden in Storium. It is not the game that people get to play when they played with Storium. And that's a shame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444305/#Comment_444305" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T20:59:45+00:00" title="March 19, 2015  8:59PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>yeah, that looks like some sort of weird system typo or something?</blockquote>\nNot sure why I didn't link the site! <br/><a href="https://www.tavern-keeper.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.tavern-keeper.com<br/></a>\n<blockquote><a href="https://www.tavern-keeper.com/home" rel="nofollow">Tavern Keeper</a> is what <a href="/forums/profile/orklord">@orklord</a> was referring to.</blockquote>\nThanks for the assist, Trevis!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444306/#Comment_444306" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T21:09:02+00:00" title="March 19, 2015  9:09PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My success with PBP has been through methods <a href="/forums/profile/Squidlord">@Squidlord</a> mentioned.<br/>The very basic level of how I GM:<br/>Build a group of players.<br/>Split them up into singles or pairs.<br/>Cross them over with each other and have events from one scene affect the others when possible.<br/>Sometimes bring them all together, for a brief action.<br/>Mix the singles and pairs around.<br/><br/>I imagine I'm the editor-in-chief at a comic book publisher.

They thought another Obsidian Portal would have more appeal, but the tools they created for the PBP has been pretty great. Not perfect, but better than any others for the kinds of games I dig.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444342/#Comment_444342" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-20T13:17:30+00:00" title="March 20, 2015  1:17PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From what I've seen Tavern Keeper in the end is just a normal forum...<br/>Each new "game" is a sub-forum with access to stuff like a game-wiki and a page that collects all characters.<br/>Cleaner and nicer than "normal" forums... but that's mainly it.<br/><br/>Am I missing something?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444346/#Comment_444346" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-20T15:05:46+00:00" title="March 20, 2015  3:05PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>From what I've seen Tavern Keeper in the end is just a normal forum...<br/>Each new "game" is a sub-forum with access to stuff like a game-wiki and a page that collects all characters.<br/>Cleaner and nicer than "normal" forums... but that's mainly it.<br/><br/>Am I missing something?</blockquote>\nI think so?
