<p>So I was thinking about some things said in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1209&amp;page=1#Item_21" rel="nofollow">Puppetry thread</a>, specifically John Kim's example of Mary Kuhner:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>I remember in particular a story I think of Mary Kuhner's where out of game, the GM discussed with her at length various hypotheticals and how she thought her characters would react. However, when the actual game happened and he presented the situation, her character reacted completely differently than any of her predictions.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This struck me as important and in need of separate discussion; how is it that we can make characters inextricable from play? Let me try and stumble toward an answer...</p>
<p>It's not strictly an immersive phenomenon, as John's example is; in Sol Invictus, where I play a character Birds-of-Trinity, I have the same pattern of failed prediction; it's an IRC game, and about as non-immersive as they come. But it remains the same - I can <em>try</em> to write and talk about Birds, but outside of play, I can't produce correct Birds output. It isn't her. Other players in the same game (who can chime in if they choose) report similar effects.</p>
<p>So, there is a sort of obvious conclusion here, but to me it feels unnatural; for some reason we can't depict those characters without the presence (not necessarily participation; one-on-one scenes with just the GM or just one other character are not uncommon) of the other players. I don't have any clue what process would underly <em>that,</em> and that is where I am puzzled.</p>

                            Contrast this with authors of fiction, who frequently describe their characters forging their own way on the page, making unexpected choices.  That occurs without observers or participants.                        </div>

                            I agree with Jason about the author phenomenon.  I've also experienced the situation of characters having "personal" reactions rather than predicted ones.  To a degree it is an immersive expression, but it also is reflective of the behavior of people as people.  Often people speculate about real-life situations and how they will handle them.  These are often as far off base as predictions about their character reactions for game.                        </div>

                            I'm not sure about the author thing. <br/><br/>I have a different idea. When we play RPGs, the entire point of play is to make things up in play. It's an act of improvisation. If you stick to a plan, then you're just playing through a script. So, if you want to be improvising, and you have this script that you've created through prior discussion....<br/><br/>Well, I know that I'd be avoiding that script. Discussing what your character might do is what Ron has refered to as "playing before you play." Not wanting to repeat your play, you do something else. <br/><br/>I can't say for sure this is the phenomenon for everyone, but I can garuntee that it's the case with me. This is why I always refuse to try to make any predictions about what my character will do, and instead always push to start actual play. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Very well put.  I agree it's the difference between writing and performance.  Even if it's a solo performance, you'll be interacting with the audience.                        </div>

                            As Shreyas puts it, it is, in a way, the presence of the other players. Writing up "background" for a character, for isntance, doesn't have the same quality as coming up with background details in play, does it? Why is that? <br><br/>RPG play is about communicating values back and forth, and getting instant social reinforcement for doing do. The other players smile at the creative way in which you've managed to say something about the human condition with your narration of not only the character's actions, but also of the situation in which the character exists from which the actions emerge. Everything you do creatively. <br/><br/>If you do this from script, then it's, quite simply, not nearly as much of a feat. Worse, you may end up suffering from Jason's phenomenon, and not be able to think of anything creative when the time comes. Scripting isn't likely to be effective in any case, in a medium where everybody else is improvising. You're likely to be off your script after the first five minutes anyhow. And then all it's going to do is to make you do additional analysis trying to figure out if you can finagle things back onto the script, etc. <br/><br/>Put another way, if you've predicted to another participant what your character would do in situation X, you've played out that situation effectively. If the other participant says, "yeah, that's cool" then the moment of transmission has come and past. Doing it again later can only be a repeat performance, the results of which we already know. <br/><br/>I've actually seen some OOC play go like this:<br/><br/>Player A: "OK, what would my character do in a situation like this?"<br/>Player B: "How about he reveals that he's secretly a transvestite?"<br/>Player A: "Oh, that's awesome. GM, my character does that."<br/><br/>You see how the planning is the play? When this happens, players usually want to skip the narration of the scene. Because the important part, the decision of what happens vis a vis the plot, has already been made in front of all of the players. The last statement is merely getting GM affirmation that the events in question are entered into the SIS. Being that normally you'd have some narration involved, which upon not being struck down, serves the same purpose. <br/><br/><br/>This explains, too, another phenomenon:<br/><br/>Player A: "OK, what would my character do in a situation like this?"<br/>Player B: "How about he reveals that he's secretly a transvestite?"<br/>Player A: "Oh, that's awesome. Buuuuut... I have the character kill yours instead."<br/><br/>Call this the "Stealing Thunder" syndrome. I agree that OOC conversation is almost always a good idea, in that it helps ensure that everyone will enjoy play. But if play is about getting social rewards for value transmission, then if you simply say, "Uh, yeah, what he said" you don't get the reward, the player who made the suggestion does. At best you get the weaker, "Thanks for taking my suggestion" social reward. So, even if the player makes an awesome suggestion, players may go with something else, merely because they want some reward, and know they won't get it if they say yes to the other player's idea. <br/><br/>When playing, therefore, I think that it's a good idea to give very general advice as to what sort of things you'd like to see, instead of specifics, unless the player is really, really stuck. Because otherwise you're just "planning" for the player, which has the same problems as if he planned - even worse, really. <br/><br/>Mike                        </br></div>

                            I think what's been said is all good stuff.  However, I come at this from another angle, one that can be an "also true" rather than a "this instead" thing.<br><br>To my eye, talking about characters outside of play is talking about them outside of context.  Roleplaying characters in actual play is talking about them very much in context.  What I mean by that is this: in play, characters are surrounded by a vast landscape of details, other characters, motivations, mechanical support and reinforcement, player audience, et cetera et cetera et cetera.  All of these things inform our decision-making process, and when we try and predict character behavior outside of play we're trying to make decisions without that context.<br><br>In a similar illustrative vein, this is one of the big things about <em>Dogs</em> for me.  Making big weighty moral decisions is easy when it's just the question and no context -- killing people is wrong.  But then putting those questions in the context of desperate and hurting people turns everything on its head -- is it wrong to kill a man who's been sleeping with your wife while you raised up his kids because he's a paraplegic since the accident?  The context of details completely changes the process of answering the question; for me the same applies to the in-play and out-of-play character questions.  You can speculate, but until you're "there," in context, you don't know.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I'd go with Adam that it is the ritual space.  I'd note that fiction writers often have rituals as well -- i.e. they can't write just anywhere, they need to get their head inside a particular space.  So I think the key isn't the presence of other players per se -- it's whatever the ritual is you have developed as your way to reach the part of yourself that is the character.  <br/><br/>I've had a few examples of offline roleplaying.  For example, in the long Buffy campaign which I was in (called "Silicon Valley Slayage"), my character had a blog.  So what was posted in the blog was a part of the game.  And there was some interesting role-playing which went on there (between back-and-forth posts and the comments).  I'd expect that Play-by-Email players work differently, too.                        </div>

                            Based on my own experiences as a GM I think that in some cases it isn't so much that characters act differently than one would predict, but that the players default to responding to situations in a particular way. They might think their character would act along certain lines but when the pressure is really on, when I push REALLY hard, they resort to tried and true methods of conflict resolution. They take it personally. I think the division between "How I envision my character" and "How I play my character" creates this feeling that the character exists separately from the player, when in fact the character does not exist at all. Itâ€™s just the player, playing himself, wearing the characterâ€™s mask. And the one person the mask fools the most is the player himself. (I am fully aware this is NOT the case for everyone. But this has been a common experience to me)<br/>
<br/>
I donâ€™t care if Player X is playing an upstanding Jedi, a treacherous necromancer or a cop on the beat, if I really lean on him where it hurts, I know how heâ€™s gonna lean back. If heâ€™s playing a character that matches his personality, he feels like heâ€™s really â€˜got into the characterâ€™. If he was playing a character that was outside the norm for him, heâ€™d surprise himself by his own actions. â€œWowâ€ Heâ€™d say, â€œI never expected Iâ€™d have a change of heart (as the selfish thief) and save the puppy.â€ Even though his virtuous knight character has saved puppies by the score. Some people just like saving puppies.<br/>
<br/>
Often it more complex than just that, though. Usually there a blending between the player's ideals and what the player perceives as the character's ideals. I think that the degree to how evident this becomes depends on the nature of the game played. A light DnD romp doesnâ€™t have a lot of moral weight, and itâ€™s easier to play a character far different from your self. Play a game like Dogs, however, and the players begin to slide back towards their own ideals and moral center, regardless of their character.                        </div>

<p>I think the ritual/context thing is what's doing it for me, hm. Thanks for all your thoughts, gentlemen. Very illuminating.</p>
