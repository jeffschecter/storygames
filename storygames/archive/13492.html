A buddy and I have put together a playset for Fiasco based on the work of Jim Henson. I am posting the first draft here for feedback on any improvements that need to be made. Right now I feel like it is solid but a little unfocused. We've tried to encompass as much of Muppet-canon as possible. So that not only means the Muppet Show/Movies but also Fraggle Rock, Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. The diversity of the works is so great that we had a little trouble trying it all together. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the link, ignore spelling errors, I had so much of an issue exporting it from Open Office to PDF I'm sure something got missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.box.net/shared/eusdvp0dyt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304334/#Comment_304334" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T07:35:42+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  7:35AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was tempted to describe my Fiasco PC from the other night as Kermit the Frog: vaguely sane and competent, but so surrounded by weirdos and incompetents that he cannot deal with the ensuing chaos.<br/><br/>This playset probably would work best with a different Tilt table and softer Aftermath table than standard Fiasco.

But traditional Muppet wackiness would definitely be more fun than Kermit blowing his own stuffing out or Fozzie getting stuffed in the wood chipper in the Aftermath.<br/><br/>I'll have to give this a bit more thorough read later (as I am at work), but I think it looks pretty good.

Kermit puts up with a lot of dysfunctional bullshit and that has to wear a frog down. Some day he's going to snap, you know? There's a lot going on with the Electric Mayhem and most of it has to be illegal. Is Bunsen Honeydew cooking up huge batches of E and moving them through Janice? When is Fozzie going to come out of the closet? For that the regular tables would work, but I don't get the feeling that is the intention here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304345/#Comment_304345" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T08:19:16+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  8:19AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's good that Meet the Feebles is listed in the Movie Night section.

We designed the set to be family friendly with the option of going dark. Honestly in all our playtests we didn't ever go crazy. I think one group had a Muppet Platypus poisoning a human and forging the human's name on the deed to a movie theater. That was the most "real" the violence got. Other than that is was the standard "explosion which leaves behind everyone covered in soot and slightly on fire" cartoonish violence. We are planing to try a super dark and weird fantasy game though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain if anyone has any details in the playset that don't seem to work please mention them. We tried to cover a lot of material and then word it in ways that even if you had seemingly conflicting details, like a mushroom forest and a laser can opener it worked together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304473/#Comment_304473" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T19:55:39+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  7:55PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this idea.

In the play test, all the players were adults, I tried to run a 6 player game for the first time out of necessity, unfortunately the player Steve had to leave at the Tilt.  I forgot the rule of giving away the dice before Tilt; so that probably caused everyone to roll higher in the end.  I was curious which direction the players would take the game; make it a wacky adventure (like a real Muppets movie) or take it dark as mentioned above.  My biggest concern, as I mentioned above was if the Softer Aftermath table in the Companion book would be soft enough; I'll go into this more later.  This is a little long, so if I should be posting else where, pls just let me know, here is a write up of how it turned out.<br/><br/>Annie Mal (a female Animal, estranged from Howser)<br/>Howser (a mime and sidekick to Kiki)<br/>KiKi (an over dramic cat superstar)<br/>Boris Alucard (a monical wearing dragon and rival to KiKi)<br/>Steve the Zombie (a custodian zombie, and Boris's lover)<br/>Fozzie the Bear (left in charge by Kermit)<br/><br/>Fozzie and Annie play pranks on each other and Fozzie talks about wanting to earn respect by pulling the best prank EVER.  Annie confronts her ex Howser, apparently part of the reason he is estranged is due to her having sex reassignment surgery.  Annie confesses she still has feelings for him and is jealous of his partnership with KiKi (it's platonic but she thinks it's more).  Kiki finds she will be the spokes person for the Guinness Book's giant cookie event, while Boris makes plans to steal the giant cookie as a mission for the Godfather Cookie Monster.  Steve gets pranked by the team of Fozzie and Annie.  Fozzie gets word of the giant cookie and deciding that the funniest prank ever would be to put laxatives in the cookie as it is made, and prior to that get rid of all the port-a-potties outside the Bizarre Tourist Trap where Guinness is holding the cookie measuring and eating party.  Via mistaken communication, Annie thinks the large debit Howser and KiKi have is instead an unwanted pregnancy, when Annie tells Howser KiKi is pregnant, he thinks she sleeps around.  Howser gets involved fighting the Mime Mafia.  There's a "bun in the oven" sight gag with KiKi, that Annie accidently over hears but doesn't see, so she misunderstands and this results in more miscommunication.  Boris proceeds with his giant cookie heist plan with Steve's help.  Feeling picked on, Steve has an altercation with Fozzie and sort of pranks him, which Fozzie enjoys and Steve ends up dropping a flyer containing info on the giant cookie.  The Tilt happens, we used the tilt table from the Companion book, we get "a joke takes on a life of its own" and "an unwanted confession".<br/><br/>A clip of Fozzie and Annie pushing a cart at Costco with a gigantic towering bottle of laxative in it, while musiack plays in the background (ala Fargo) and then them putting some gum on the counter; "to not look suspicious" with the purchase.  Clips of them infiltrating the Swedish chiefs, wearing mustaches and hats/jackets, and then finally spiking the cookie dough.  Annie makes it clear she wants the baby she thinks is unwanted btwn Houser and KiKi, and tries to talk to Howser.  Howser, annoyed at several things, including the Mime Mafia, breaks with 4th wall and has an angry talk with Ron Howard regarding the Muppet's image while standing in the "real world".  This is interrupted by a "pimped out" Kermit, telling Howser to get back to work, which he does.  Kiki ends up in the hospital as she has tried the giant cookie samples, but Annie thinks she is having the baby, there's a mix up and Annie and Howser do get handed a baby.  Unable to steal the whole giant Cookie, Boris tries to savage a large part of it for the Godfather, not knowing it was tainted.  Steve the Zombie (player left) gets attacked by a flock of angry chickens, which were related to Boris's plan, and which were eating the crumbs of the broken cookie.  Fozzie basically makes a jerk of himself enjoying the idea that the best prank ever is about to go off (but we don't see it yet).  Annie has this baby she doesn't really know what to do with and tries to reunite with her ex Howser.  Meanwhile Howser sustains invisible injuries with the Mime Mafia and is hospitalized, KiKi resolves somethings, and Boris is confronted by the Cookie Monster Godfather upset that he was going to get a tainted cookie.  The prank finishes, and we accomplished all the Tilt statements, as well as worked in all the other things on the cards.  We just did one montage each due to the late hour.<br/><br/>Prior to running the play test, I expressed the concern that I didn't know if the Softer Aftermath would be soft enough for a Muppets game; if it happened to stay fairly true to the style of the show and movies.  Arpie provided me a great deal of support and feedback; even rewriting a partial Aftermath table to be soft enough to work for the Muppets style adventures we know from the movies and TV.  I am very appreciate of his work and help, and I will certainly use this Even Softer Aftermath table/Muppet Aftermath table if the players end up playing the game in a similar style to the Muppet movies/show in the future.  At the play test we looked at both Arpie's table and the Softer Aftermath from the Companion book and either worked.  However, since the players did take the game in the direction of a typical Fiasco game, with the rolls they got, the Softer Aftermath in the Companion book weren't too harsh and worked out fine.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381861/#Comment_381861" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T08:47:22+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  8:47AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do this one for free - don't sell it.

I think the game would turn out a lot different with kids playing, also it would be interesting to see where people who aren't familiar with Fiasco would take the game.  The players for the play test I did were all pretty much from my regular gaming group, we all know each other's gaming styles and know Fiasco pretty well.  So I think it was pretty easy for my group to just slide into the regular way we run a Fiasco game, despite the genre being a little different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
