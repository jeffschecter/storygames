Austin at the beginning of the month. STAPLE! started out as a comic show and while the organizer is serious about expanding the scope to other indie media, its still 90 to 95% comics. A day or two before the show, I thought I should have some kind of signage to go along with Kagematsu, something that says just what this weird looking book is about. As Paul and I sat in the hotel\u2019s business center the night before the show brainstorming what to say, I must have been channeling the undergrad classes in museum studies about statics for interpretative text:<br/>\xb7\t8th grade reading level<br/>\xb7\tshould take no longer than 20-30 seconds<br/>\xb7\tfont changes, paragraph breaks etc for emphasis and to draw the eye<br/><br/>So what I needed to do was have my sign make a person: A- read it; B- pick up the book; and C- be compelled to buy it. So here\u2019s what I came up with.<br/><br/>\tsign<a href="https://896548313779120216-a-1802744773732722657-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/creamaliengames/Home/kagematsu-the-rpg/staplesign.JPG?attachauth=ANoY7cp-dRj5MNFl4gHKFeI4aJvbU0WHpWboCfksb_QW1CXOvYkAqS9S4nZeMR3DdTQ1VFjz3eTs2cJD6sU4Ij3BA5qO4CtHag_f5X8fV8anOkaky2ZfHlv44GyRWFWFaUnaPoHmtqKoNuZBSt0oOZrlSMX9qwbKSyL8OBDNXw5o-7Z2r-e0gbOM3QBbRuz7Gh3Dte3PtH3JTbgMI71hB8z85-XRj_6BV6wxmSaDbA55yfrEHMCpYIM%3D&amp;attredirects=0" rel="nofollow">Staple Sign</a><br/><br/>Did it work?<br/>Paul and I had the same regular guy off the aisle customer sales (he had some retail sales which I am excluding). We were at the end of a row and people DID stop to read it. Without being exact, more people stopped to read the sign than pick up Paul\u2019s game and read the back of it.<br/><br/>What went wrong?<br/>\xb7\tI didn\u2019t give much thought into the text or format, it could be refined more. Some image or symbols added?<br/>\xb7\tThe hotel printer was ass and had little toner so it was not very dark and it really lost some dynamic quality. <br/>\xb7\tThis was still a comic show. People wanted to relate it somehow with what I had and asked if I had done the illustrations. <br/><br/>We are going to a local creativity arts show in June and I intend to improve my signage for the show and see again how it works in practice. So, here is the discussion:<br/>\xb7\tIs the existing signage compelling as a narrative? Draws the eye?<br/>\xb7\tWhat do you think of the use of museum interpretative theory representing games to a non gaming crowd?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263728/#Comment_263728" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T14:09:03+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  2:09PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a graphic would help draw interest a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263733/#Comment_263733" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T14:37:18+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  2:37PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2010 2:37PM by Tristan.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a very good idea.

Signs along nature trails are designed to grab attention on their own since they're generally not referencing a specific item. I was on a short trail on some wetlands on the Olympic Peninsula lately and even the signs that were primarily historical (shellfish farming or whatever) included art conceptually tied to the topic.<br/><br/>Not sure how it works for other people, but I did find out a lot about shellfish farming and reclamation just because there were signs that pretty much demanded to be read.<br/><br/>It's a little hard to gather from the photo, what size was this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263816/#Comment_263816" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T21:13:19+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  9:13PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done tables and booths and I've attended lots of conventions and trade shows, and so before this I had pretty much believed I'd seen the general range of effective presentation of games. What's the likelihood of coming up with something different that's more effective than what folks who've been at this for years are doing?<br/><br/>So I was pretty surprised at how strong this little slip of signage was. We had a eight foot table, a very nice black fabric tablecloth, and just a few products laid out (Kagematsu, Bitch, My Life with Master, Bacchanal, and my Well of Else cards), so the whole thing was already a bit like a curated museum display. But the little slip of signage was really grabby. People don't know what to do with an object like My Life with Master or Kagematsu. (The saddle-stitched form factor and page count suggests they might be comic books. But then they're full of text. And the prices are too high for comic books. And they say they're games, but what kind of game is all text and no game pieces?) But everyone knows what to do with museum style interpretive signage. You read it. And it tells you how to appreciate what you're looking at.<br/><br/>Yes, this time it didn't translate to sales. But the number of people who read the little slip of signage that didn't pick up My Life with Master really has my head turning on the potential of it. Absolutely My Life with Master and Bacchanal will have such signage, done on nice cardstock, when we're at <a href="http://idea-men.us/smacc.html" rel="nofollow">SMACC</a> in July.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263820/#Comment_263820" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T21:46:31+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  9:46PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite><br/>I'm Mexican, so the term is less clear and direct to me.

My take-away from this experience is that museum style interpretive signage works differently. It puts the viewer into the mental context of a museum...subconsciously suggesting that what they're seeing are works that require a little considered thinking. "Here, viewer, is how to appreciate this thing." Maybe it won't work at SMACC, and worked at STAPLE because Austin area attendees are generally hungrier for new experiences, but I'm definitely sure it has potential that's worth refining.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263888/#Comment_263888" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T09:38:10+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  9:38AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Tristan, 8th grade in the US is for 13-14 year old students in their 8th year of formal education.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test" rel="nofollow">More on readability</a>.</blockquote>\nThan you.

If you've never played an RPG before, the text is difficult to understand. Hell, its hard for me to understand. I would simplify. For example:<br/><i>A samurai speaks to a woman of a small village. "No," the samurai says, "I have not seen the fireflies in the meadow at dusk. Perhaps I could escort you this evening?" But the woman's spoiled younger sister, passing by with but a coy glance behind a fan, steals the samurai's attention, and his heart." </i> (or something) I think this is a more clearly framed situation. Describing the actual narrative of the game. Then when you say: "In a single evening 3-5 of your friends can play such and such characters", you can get into which gender can play what and who can take on what roles (ie men playing women and women playing men).<br/><br/>2. Illustrate this situation in general! Have a samurai and a girl on the poster! Its not just about katanas, its about love, right! Illustrate that idea somehow. Even the poster says "Its about the collaborative definition of love." Show that.<br/><br/>3. I love the idea of RPGs being curated. Describing them in such a manner takes it up a notch in the seriousness that they're approached with, as well as their value as an art form. Awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264075/#Comment_264075" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T13:54:35+00:00" title="March 25, 2010  1:54PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My instinct was similar to anasigirl's. Aggressively red-line that isn't directly supporting your main "sales thrust." Currently, your sign is trying to yell "gender-bending indie RPG!" which is arguably hard to approach and/or unintelligible to the target audience. Now, this is basically the pitch that got me to look at the game, and then buy it after a demo at last GenCon, but I am likely not much like the audience in question. So, working from anasigirl's text:<br/><br/>KAGEMATSU<br/><br/>The samurai turns his attention from the small village's meager defenses to glance at the confident young woman. "No," the samurai says, "I have not seen the fireflies in the meadow at dusk. Perhaps I could escort you this evening?" But the woman's spoiled younger sister, with but a coy glance from behind her fan, steals the samurai's attention, and then his heart.<br/><br/>In a single evening, 3-5 of your friends will play out the fate of a threatened Japanese village, and the fates of the samurai and village women who woo him.<br/><br/><br/>Quickly jab out with color, brief description, and an easy-to-understand description of "what is this?" I was quickly trying to evoke Seven Samurai to work on my side. I'm soft-selling gender issues, RPG, and indie for now.<br/><br/>And then someone either starts asking/investigating or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielleLewon" title="DanielleLewon"><img alt="DanielleLewon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielleLewon">DanielleLewon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265656/#Comment_265656" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T13:42:50+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  1:42PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi folks,<br/><br/>Some really great suggestions from Kira and Mark, I can see how to write it better and where the emphasis should be. I love adding some real personal conflicts like between the sisters, that throws a real punch. Thanks! I do have some pics, the sword like Anna suggested would be an easy add in. I'm not sure about adding one of the interiors to a poster, maybe a piece of one. I do have one of Anna's prints which I can take to a local show. I'll post a new version before the show in June and see how it works.<br/><br/>Thanks again!<br/>-Danielle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
