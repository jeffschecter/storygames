I've run MG as a one-shot before, but this was different for a few reasons.  I had four players sign up in advance, and for a bit I thought I would have six - but we ended up with five.  Carl jokingly commented to me "You'd run Mouse Guard with six players?  Are you insane?!?"  <br/><br/>The game turned out to be immense fun, and different for a few reasons from my previous one-shots.  My previous one-shots had used the pregenerated characters from the book, and the scenarios there or variants of them.  They had fewer players, and they were a lot shorter (less than 3 hours).  With five players and some time, I decided at the last minute to put away the pregens, print some character sheets, and have everyone generate PCs.  This showed them more of the system and tailored things a good deal.  On the other hand, we only played out one Conflict using the full system - with everything else using regular skill checks.  <br/><br/>The players I had, and the characters they created were: <br/><br/>1) Oliver playing Cole, an impulsive patrol guard and the team leader<br/>2) Heather playing Josephine, a bookish and young new guard mouse<br/>3) Joey playing Folker, a level-headed and independent patrol guard <br/>4) Ben playing Lily, a brash tenderpaw assigned to Folker<br/>5) Owen playing Garrow, a calm and rational negotiator<br/><br/>Luckily we had four copies (one electronic) of the main book, so character creation went fairly smoothly - although I think it could be streamlined.  All the players were good about setting up conflicts among the group.  Cole and Folker were set up to clash as the two highest-ranking mice with very different personalities, with Folker in particular being concerned over Cole being a bad influence on Lily.  <br/><br/>I then put together the adventure by pulling in as much of the character sheets as I could.  The only two characters from the same town were Josephine and Garrow from Sprucetuck - so the adventure was in Sprucetuck.  Looking over their wises, I noted they knew about Governors, weasels, poisons, and some others I don't remember now.  So those featured.  I then made sure to include one of either their Friend or Enemy from each PC.  Luckily two shared an enemy - Josephine and Cole both picked the name Ivy for their enemy, and we decided it was the same person, a healer who was Josephine's rival and Cole's ex-girlfriend.  And, of course, whenever there was a failed test, come up with a juicy Twist to apply to it.  <br/><br/>A highlight was when Josephine tried to use her Archivist roll to find out who three dead mice were.  When she failed her roll, Owen (playing Garrow) suggested that it should be someone they know.  Looking over my stable of NPCs from the character sheets, I decided that it was...  Garrow's parents, and since there were three he had a younger sister who died with them.  Everyone had a good time, and all of the characters were fairly involved with the adventure - with Joey's character Folker being the least involved.  It included a good mix of everyone's skills, I think - with some outdoor, some fighting, some negotiating, and some sneaking.  <br/><br/>A few conclusions that I drew from this: <br/><br/>(1) The pregens and scenarios from the MG book aren't great.  I will definitely at least rework them some if I try them again.  <br/><br/>(2) While the Conflict system is important to MG, there are many other sides to the system to highlight.  <br/><br/>(3) It was a really fun group of players, whom I hope to see again at some future gathering.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289640/#Comment_289640" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T16:38:32+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  4:38PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2010 4:39PM by framweard.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I would have been more involved if I had taken your advice and ditched the "Independent" trait. Having mechanical back-up to reinforce my conceptual cautiousness just meant I had even fewer reasons to get involved with the mission, as the other two "cautious" mice had great reasons to get all impulsive (Josephine's enemy Ivy was influential and the fact that Garrow's parents had been killed). I sort of struggled with ways to get in the thick of things, but in the end I got to take part in the negotiations that led to the rogue Guardmouse's arrest, and that was a great deal of fun. And it was fun tugging on Lily's fur and hearing Josephine scream bloody murder about my impulsive and reckless ward. Cole and Folker had some good moments too.<br/><br/>I do think the best moment was when Heather 'killed' Garrow's parents with her Archivist roll. The conflict you set up was also great to watch, and really got me excited about more Mouse Guard. Good times all around.<br/><br/>Oh well. I had a lot of fun! I'm sure we'll all see each other again at future Bay Area events. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290052/#Comment_290052" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T15:09:30+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  3:09PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who received Fate and Persona awards?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290124/#Comment_290124" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T18:01:54+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  6:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The pregens and scenarios from the MG book aren't great.

I only run the game occasionally so I don't have a lot of experience with it - in what way would you recommend reworking the missions / sample characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
