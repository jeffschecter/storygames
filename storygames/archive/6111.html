We're running two tables throughout the con.  Table 1 will host scheduled games (Black Cadillacs, PTA, Agon, MLwM, Inspectres).  Table 2 will be a variant of Games on Demand.  We have a fair number of games in our repertoire, and whoever isn't at Table 1 will be on hand to run games for walk-up participants.</p>\n<p>This year, we're focusing on full-form (4 hour) games, rather than demos.  It seems to be more in keeping with the expectations of typical CanGames attendees.</p>\n<p>This isn't just an announcement.  If you're going to be in Ottawa during May 16-18, and would like to help out, please drop me a line (whisper in thread is great).  We'd love to have more GMs for the Games on Demand table.</p>\n<p>Also, I'm very open to suggestions as to how to get the GoD table attracting as many players as possible.  CanGames is a dyed-in-the-wool grognard con, and it's a little bit like swimming against the current getting anything other than D&amp;D to fly there.  Not impossible, but tough.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br/>\nD</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
