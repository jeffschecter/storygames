We loved it. It took us a little while to get to playing, but it became some memorable stuff. We snatched up every White Dwarf we could get our hands on, and we just sat around drooling over all the cool things within. <br/><br/>A few months later, he bought this thing called Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader. Now, we weren't really wargamers. We really liked all the few minis he had (I didn't have many, myself), but we were more into role-playing.<br/><br/>But, this book just knocked my socks off. It was the coolest thing I had ever seen in a game. And, there was just enough stuff in there to tease me that it might be a role-playing game. I vaguely recall lists of equipment a navigator might have. I can't even remember just what the heck one did with that book besides drool over it. <br/><br/>Today is the release of Dark Heresy, the first official Warhammer 40,000 role-playing game. I'm pretty pumped! I won't get mine for a few more days, likely. Now, I'm an indie curmudgeon to beat all hell, and I usually just frown when I pick up mainstream RPGs these days. Chances are Dark Heresy will have a bunch of stuff that'll drive me batty. <br/><br/>But, damn it, if that book doesn't already make me feel like a kid again. <br/><br/>I can't wait to see it! The previews have me pretty pumped. I really dig what I see, and what I've seen of the presentation of the game knocks me out. Yay!<br/><br/>I've already seen a few people chomping at the bit for this one. So, let's hear it! Do you have it yet?

I'm a hippie storygamer.  I don't go in for this 40K drivel.  Helping an Inquisitor?  Hah.<br/><br/>As an enlightened Nar player, I'm waiting for the Space Marine 40K game that's coming out.  Genetically manipulated soldiers with superhuman reflexes and ridiculously overpowered weaponry.  Terminator armor:  now <i>that's</i> storygaming.<br/><br/>(takes tongue out of his cheek)<br/><br/>Okay, I'll be serious now.<br/><br/>While I haven't played 40K in years, I've long wondered how you would do a 40K RPG.  So I'm glad that it's out in the world.  I also like the structure of the game, which actually makes sense.  You can't all be the Inquisitor, so the idea of playing a team working for an Inquisitor seems like an excellent setup for a party-based game.<br/><br/>That being said, I have heard rumblings about a Marine RPG (uh, title anyone?)though, and that's the one that really does excite me.  I totally want to play a Space Wolf Terminator sergeant boarding a space hulk filled with Genestealers or Chaos scum.

I always wanted to turn 40K into a small-scale skirmish game with roleplaying elements, something like old school (or new school, really) D&amp;D or Space Hulk.

Honestly, I think <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5338" rel="nofollow">our Warhammer 1K1 hack</a> will work better for one-shots and short-term play, but the idea of ye olde schoole roleplaying campaign in the world of 40K, where you put in a good 6-10 sessions, at least, is also pretty appealing.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure I have enough background in the 40K mythos to run it, so I'd have to play in someone else's game.<br/><br/>I think it is cool that they chose the Inquisition for their first game.  I bet they've been playing some <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, yeah?  Just, in 40K, you always escalate to shooting.

Dark Heresy is just the beginning, however. After this basic game, two further games released eighteen months apart will allow the players to progress and explore the universe first as Rogue Traders and alien pirates, and eventually experienced players will be able to roleplay the devastating warriors of the Adeptus Astartes Deathwatch.<br/><br/>All three games use the same game system, which is itself based in part upon the award-winning Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Players will be able to progress from one system to the next, as they gain experience and a measure of understanding of the vastly detailed universe of Warhammer 40,000. Each of the games will consist of a core rulebook accompanied by regular releases of sourcebooks and adventures.</blockquote>\nAlso, TS and a bunch of the other designers <a href="http://www.blackindustries.com/?template=40k&amp;content=dh-designers-notes" rel="nofollow">talk about their work on the game here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121911/#Comment_121911" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T11:17:54+00:00" title="January 25, 2008 11:17AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was my first big RPG disappointment... that people could dream up the WH40K background, with all those amazingly cool opportunities for adventure and tragedy, and it could be a miniatures wargame.

So, to explain ... <br/><br/>I actually  like WHFRP 2E. And, this after I swore for two years after it came out I would not like it, nor buy it. I've read it cover to cover, and it turns out it's a pretty nifty fantasy game. I can't possibly keep up with the supplementitis, but that's ok. The two books I own? Pretty cool stuff for what it is.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'm fond of the careers themselves, and how they work as a reward mechanic. Now, how a group doles out XP is a fuzzy subject. But, as a player? Man! I'd be slavering all over to attain those cool careers. Just something quirky and wonderful about them that feels cooler than gaining levels.<br/><br/>The branced paths of the Inquisitor hangers-on (i.e. Dark Heresy PCs!) looks pretty neat. I found that to be the most appealing thing about the game, though I know only bits and pieces so far. <br/><br/>The specific mechanics of the percentile dice and so on, well, I'm pretty lukewarm on that. And, the dungeon-delving sample adventure OR the assumptions about how to play the fantasty (and presumably this new game) probably aren't <i>my</i> cup of tea. I smell a bunch of stuff that isn't my thing, like low to non-existent player input on situations, probable (?) assumptions about GM-is-god stuff. Blah. <br/><br/>But, the specific set up of being the inquistor's lackeys and sniffing out corruption and heresy? Far out! Stir that with the neato careers, and then go heavy with a dose of story gaming ethic? Might turn out pretty cool! We'll see if I get a game going later on this year. My regular monthly group is likely to stick with D&amp;D for about 2 more sessions, and then who knows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121934/#Comment_121934" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T13:55:41+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  1:55PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I think it is cool that they chose the Inquisition for their first game.

Indeed the first scenario I ran was set in Necromunda, and featured chaos cultists and, as I remember, an Inquisitor. I'd been playing with the rules (called, I think, 'Galaxy of Night') for a little while and had taken them to Gaelcon (in Dublin) with me. In one of the afternoon slots I was at a loose end and thought I'd give them a go, so I got the guy with the PA to ask if anyone wanted to play ... and got an instant response, in fact more players than I could handle (I think there was a 40k tournament going on).<br/><br/>That game went well, and I ran different one-offs a number of times over subsequent years, mostly at Conpulsion in Edinburgh. I ran a couple of different scenarios, the best involving Eldar scouts which had some miniatures from Battlefleet Gothic as colour.<br/><br/>So yes ...

But you know what? It made me so happy I nearly cried, especially when I found the random stat generation tables. I laughed out loud when I saw what the Imperium do to their sanctioned psykers. <br/><br/>I always loved WFRP in part because compared to D&amp;D it was bloody freeform storytelling, and the slightly faster and loser rules system totally suited that. Our games were all about the world and the characters, and the careers system totally supports the concepts of characters moving on from their old lives instead of reinforcing their behaviours like D&amp;D does.<br/><br/>So applying that to Dark Heresy gives me: Yay! Careers! Hmm, branching paths? Not so sure, too much like leveling, doesn't encourage diversity and character development the same way. More appropriate to the setting though. Yay! Setting! 100 pages of it, which is pretty slim considering the Imperium of Mankind encompasses a billion worlds. Yay! Same old rules! Means it still feels like I'm playing WFRP which means darkness, horror, fighting back and dropping fate points like rain.<br/><br/>That's three Yay's out of Four. Add that to the visceral joy of just having the 40K world finally in my hands, and yeah, I'm sold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121966/#Comment_121966" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T17:53:55+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  5:53PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm mostly worried about all the whiffing at low levels, mechanically speaking.

I was planning to get the complete trilogy of games.<br/><br/>Then the Dark Heresy demo came out.<br/><br/>I downloaded and read it.<br/><br/>Then I started to think about 40K-ing DitV, Wushu, and even HERO.<br/><br/>And then I remembered I have <i>Burning Empires</i>, that did all the hard work for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121992/#Comment_121992" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T01:01:17+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  1:01AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I'm mostly worried about all the whiffing at low levels, mechanically speaking.

I've been skimming the Dark Heresy -book for the past three days, and reading the setting material. It's good, slightly above average stuff. Combined with the kind of gut feeling about WH40K-universe, I feel somewhat inspired. That's a lot more than most books give these days. I'm a bit disappointed with the art, though.<br/><br/>I'm under the impression that the rules are based on the new edition of WHFRP, which again are based on the old WHFRP, which I'm familiar with. As yer basic bang-bang-slash-slahs -rules, they work out okay. I'm gathering energy to read and learn them, and run a game with them. Though it's again 200+ pages of stuff that used with pretty simple system. I'm not a huge fan of D&amp;D-kind of talent- and skill-bloat.<br/><br/>As a friendly reminder, attempting to install any kind of other systems to WH40K is heresy, punishable by death. The inquisitors are already on their way. No warning shots. Keep clean, citizens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121999/#Comment_121999" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T04:10:16+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  4:10AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's great to log on to SG this morning with my cup of tea and see so much excitement for Dark Heresy!

I get an indecent thrill playing my cold, calculating, part-machine tech adept who views humans as potential errors to be corrected. <br/><br/>Yes, it wears it's WFRP heritage on its sleeve, but it's definitely a progression, a more streamlined form. Yes, your basic stats whiff a little at low levels, but most of the time you won't be rolling just basic stats - you'll be including bonuses from skills and equipment and circumstances. Plus you can feasibly start at any rank too, so there's no need to go for the whole "from the gutter up" approach.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm really excited about this and it's great to see excitement here too amongst my fellow story gamers!

As my idea of 40k fun isn't playing underpowered shlubs getting ordered around by their Inquisitor and I don't like the WFRP system, Dark Heresy probably isn't what I've been waiting for.

I was big into the minis game starting around 1987, and drifted away from it in the early 90's when GW's prices made me give up.<br/><br/>I did do a conversion for GURPS, and me and the Tokyo Crew had a good time with that for a while.<br/><br/>I've got the new WH40K: Dark Heresy, and it truly is a magnificent piece of work. It's a traditional RPG through and through, and makes no bones about it at all. Hippy indie gamers are going to want to put their retro-safety pants on to deal with passages such as "The game master is there to create the world for the players. All the ideas in this book are tools for the GM to use as they see fit. The GM is the ultimate arbitrator of the rules and may choose to modify, amend or even ignore certain rules to better suit the playing style of your group. Abide by your GM's decisions as they are the one doing all the work to keep you and your group entertained!"<br/><br/>Personally, that bit of wisdom there (particularly that last sentence) makes my hair spontaneously combust, but I can deal with it. There are more statements here and there in the book like that too. Fine, I suppose, that the game knows what it's about and how it goes about it. But yeah, Matt, some of it will drive you nuts. ;-)<br/><br/>That said, it's extremely well done, and well worth the $49.95 cover price. I'm going to run it, and see if I can't get some subversive story-gaming techniques in there that no one notices... :-) I expect I might even get some current minis game players at the table who've never played an RPG before, so I can subvert them even easier, hah hah!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122124/#Comment_122124" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T22:39:26+00:00" title="January 26, 2008 10:39PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I waited and waited and finally did it with GURPS too.

Black Industries has seen fantastic success, most recently with Talisman and Dark Heresy. This change does not take away from that achievement rather it allows BL Publishing to focus on producing the best novels we can. This is a purely commercial decision and will enable us to carry on the huge growth that we have recently been experiencing with our novels\u2019<br/><br/>For the time being Black Industries will continue to post articles in support of the products on their official website, which is a fantastic resource for scenarios and gaming tools for GM\u2019s and players alike.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122321/#Comment_122321" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T08:50:07+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  8:50AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nooooo!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122329/#Comment_122329" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T09:08:36+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  9:08AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, maybe that means Green Ronin can acquire the 40K license for roleplaying games and keep producing products, just to be optimistic.<br/><br/>Hopefully we'll at least see a reprint of Dark Heresy first.

Almost page for page in fact. The only issue that this ;ayout has is that yeah, WFRP was basicaly a fantasy game, and you could run on generic knowledge all the way through the chargen stuff. DH on the other hand is a not particularly generic sci-fi setting, and given that sci-fi settings are rarely generic on the first place, its a bit more of a leap. I'd have liked an intro that goes over the basic themes, but then again, given how huge WH40K is, I guess I can forgive them.<br/><br/>Shameless Plug: Come ask Dave Allen what's up with all this at Conpulsion!

I mean, I'm disappointed there won't be anything new from BI after September and all, but not having any new "support" for it is hardly going to stop me from playing and creating stuff for as long as I please. Apparently, this lack of support is <i>definitely</i> going to stop a great deal of people from playing it. Some won't even buy a game that doesn't have "support".  That support thing sure is a crutch for some people - I got a bunch of games that have big lines of so-called support backing them up and I get by just fine doing all kinds of stuff with just the core book. Yeah, I'll buy sourcebooks, but god knows I've never relied on them to the point where my heart stops and I fly into a rage against the world when the company stops making the books or goes out of business.

Scared of bald, robed women? Yes, very much!<br/><br/>I got a copy as partial payment for a freelance job that I was stiffed on (getting payed in product instead of money means no rent this month). It's a nice book. Very big and hard. Very 40kish. I'm only about 30 pages in, but I'm enjoying it. I've laughed a few times.<br/><br/>The thing is.... it really is too traditional for my tastes (from what I cAN TELL. i PROMISE TO READ THE WHOLE THING BEFORE i PASS JUDGMENT.

Burning Wheel, Dogs... shit, Panty Explosion (but I play everything with Panty Explosion, so...). Actually, Matt Schlotte and I were talking about using the setting to test the yaoi game we're working on. <br/><br/>But it's a damn nice book, and from what I can tell, a nice traditional game.

I'm a monsterous fan of 40k, I play miniatures at least once a month. But David's objection is even more damning to me. That is, I probably would have ended up kitbashing the game anyhow. But if the source material is presented like a oWoD game, where what the important people are doing is all secret... largely because they haven't had time or space to make it up and include it in the book... then it's not even worth it as source material. <br/>\n<br/>\nI actually make an exception to my rules on art for GW. That is, I normally really don't care about the art for RPGs much at all. But for GW games, the art pretty much IS the games. And they do it well enough to pull that trick off. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if the book doesn't actually have information on what to play about - other than to say something like "have their superiors mess with their heads" and never let them figure out what's going on, so that they become so very impressed with the game world - that's useless right there. I may be overstating the case, but from early glimpses this sounds like where they were going with it. Can anyone else confirm David's observations? <br/>\n<br/>\nOr is there actually a playable premise in there somewhere? Can Todd's fiction perhaps provide something there? He I have some faith in, at least to produce quality material that might have some substance that's useful to play. Or does the other material provided make his fiction impossible in play, like so many other systems do? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Penn42" title="Penn42"><img alt="Penn42" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Penn42">Penn42</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129083/#Comment_129083" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T09:22:27+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  9:22AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.tabletopgamingnews.com/2008/02/22/12747" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tabletopgamingnews.com/2008/02/22/12747</a><br/><br/>Not dead quite yet...<br/><br/>Ch<br/>-EndGame                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5436/dark-heresy-were-you-waiting-for-20-years-like-me" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5436/dark-heresy-were-you-waiting-for-20-years-like-me" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5436/dark-heresy-were-you-waiting-for-20-years-like-me/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5436%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5436%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
