                    A friend of mine just pointed me at the nifty rules for <a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/capture-flag-rules.html" rel="nofollow">Capture The Flag With Stuff</a>. It's basically CTF, well, with stuff: Extra magic items. Fiddly bits. Special Powers.<br/><br/><i>"Stuff is a key concept in game design. Pong plus Stuff makes Arkanoid. Risk plus Stuff makes Cosmic Encounter. Rock-Scissors-Paper plus Stuff makes Magic: the Gathering. Capture-the-Flag plus Stuff makes... <b>Capture-the-Flag With Stuff</b>."</i><br/><br/>The issue came up... This sounds an awful lot like a lot of Boffer Larps. What would it take to evolve this game into a Boffer Larp of sorts? What qualities are we adding? How much or little can we add these qualities?<br/><br/>The first thing we arrived at was that, to be an actual larp, each player would need an actual identity in the game, to give them a human role instead of just that of a playing piece. The most minimal sense of identity you could give a player would be to make one of the Stuff abilities somehow intrinsic to each one. Each player now has a specialized role in the game, with some amount of niche protection; it's almost to the state of complete wargame-style D&amp;D in many ways.<br/><br/>What's the next step along that path? Individual player motivations. Give each player a Nemesis on the other team, with some bonus for capturing that Nemesis. Suddenly, they have a choice to make about how best to apply themselves. For greater effect, what if two players have the same Nemesis? Now you're introducing some mechanically enforced competition between teammates.<br/><br/>To go too much further down this road, you would probably need to dethrone the Victory Condition as the primary goal of play. Otherwise nobody would choose to value their own motivations when they are clearly opposed to Winning the game. Now you've totally changed the game; "Winning" is no longer winning. How far can you go before you Break the original game? What other dials can you turn to make CTFWS more larp-y without breaking the game?<br/><br/>(I think that the MIT Assassin's guild underwent just such an evolution, turning the straightforward college game into what were effectively convoluted spy-movie larps. I'll have to discuss the evolution with a friend of mine who was in it, though if anyone reading this board was a part of it, feel free to comment)                </div>

                            I'm not very familiar with CTFwS, but they're apparently similar to the Harvey Mudd College tradition of ITR Games.<br/>
<br/>
ITR Games are played with duct-tape daggers, and there are many different rulesets. Some are straightforward, like the assassins-vs-bodyguards-and-VIP one. But there's a large set of games based on "Happyville", a place where everyone is happy. Most people play Happyvillians, who have no special abilities, and someone is selected to be a monster of some sort (vampire, zombie master, werewolf, depending on the game). Generally, the monster has the ability to turn Happyvillians into slaves of some sort.<br/>
Then there are the variations on Happyville, which can get really convoluted, with multiple monsters, a priest who can raise the dead, and other such things. I don't play myself, so I don't know the details. But there are definitely "character classes," usually selected by drawing from a deck of cards. I think in one game, there's a bag full of character cards, with enough cards that only a handful of people actually know everything in it.<br/>
<br/>
The games have gained a lot in complexity since I came to Mudd, I think largely from the efforts/influence of a friend of mine. He wants to be a game designer, and one of the things he practices on (other than Warcraft III scenario maps) is ITR Games.<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I wanted to add that I think there might be some cross-pollination between CTFwS and ITR Games. My former roommate was very involved, and her sister would join whenever she visited, and her sister is now at CMU. The sister sent out an e-mail at one point inviting CTFwS regulars to play some ITR Games. :)                        </div>

                            I was telling a friend about CTFwS today, which led to the following exchange:<br/><br/>Me: [telling him about Capture The Flag With Stuff]<br/><br/>Him: "Wait. The 'with' in "with stuff", what does it refer to? I mean, do you use the stuff to capture the flag or is the stuff just there in the game?"<br/><br/>Me: "Well, capturing the flag is the only thing you <i>do</i> in CTF, so I'd guess the stuff is there in support of it. What's the point of having something in the game if it doesn't support what you're doing?"<br/><br/>Him: "... there's probably a good design lesson in that."<br/><br/><br/>Not that it's news to anybody here, but I liked the anecdote <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

I actually have that whole quote, from Zarf, on my big quoteboard, for inspiration.<br/><br/>Nir, i like the story, but the whole point of "with stuff" is that adding it is what makes a new game - take all the stuff out of every game and you just end up with <a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/essays/mindgame.html" rel="nofollow">Mindchess!</a> &gt;_&gt;                        </div>

                            As far as adding more larplike elements to Capture The Flag With Stuff, one must consider <a href="http://eblong.com/zarf/moopsball/index.html" rel="nofollow">Moopsball</a>, which is similar, and somewhat more larpish.<br/><br/>Also, nearly unplayable, but that's part of the idea.                        </div>

                            Sure, adding stuff to a game always changes it, but I'm not sure I agree that it always makes a new game. In the case of "Pong plus Stuff makes Arkanoid", this is clearly the case - the premise of the game changes from "pass the ball between the paddles and don't lose it" to "use the ball to crush the bricks and don't lose it". CTFwS is still clearly CTF, having the same premise, only changing in structure somewhat. Whether it's a new game or a variance on the old one would depend on how tightly you define a game, I guess. Does any variance in rules or composition immediately creates a new game?<br/>
<br/>
This becomes much more interesting when we take it to RPGs. If I play Exalted with HP instead of health levels, am I still playing Exalted? If I play Polaris and don't use the Heart-Mistaken-Moons rotation, instead choosing to let all players always control their protagonists or supporting characters at their choosing, am I still playing Polaris?<br/>
<br/>
And what if I'm not using any system at all?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there's any clear line, unless you want to take the "any change whatsoever from prescribed lands you in a distinctly different game" approach, which I don't.                        </div>

                            I was thinking more of a loose guide than a strict division; You have variants until you vary the game too much, then you have related families of games, and then you finally have really different things.<br/>
<br/>
But you're right in considering the deeper issue! Stuff can only be good if you use it properly, to support a specific design goal.<br/>
<br/>
It is just that it seems that the interesting interactions of stuff, so long as they aren't just "tacked on", are really what makes a game like CTFwS (or Risk 2160, or Seafarers, Knights, etc of Catan) engaging - the extra rules don't change the basic structure, but they change the way in which the game is played, giving you more to do, more options to juggle, more paths to choose.  <br/>
I imagine that this is what this kind of game is all about.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that RPGs are fundamentally different - there is always something else going on, where the real focus of the game lies.                        </div>
