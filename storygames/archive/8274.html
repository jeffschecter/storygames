But the more "me too" responses I received, the more I thought about this phenomenon. The idea that some people are offended by the notion that an inanimate object (or the author through this paper proxy) can influence them or even somehow control their actions. Why are they so threatened by this concept? I still don't really know.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When I think about this topic, to me, the answer is obvious, of course, mechanics influence me, the real question is, "how much?"<br/>\n<br/>\n  Still, I wonder if these sorts of theories will always have an air of controversy so long as there are highly individualistic people out there?<br/>\n  What do you guys think?<br/>\nDave M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182322/#Comment_182322" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T07:58:42+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  7:58AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are concurrent RPing hobbies out there that are fundamentally different and incompatible with one another.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182324/#Comment_182324" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T08:09:06+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  8:09AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I think there are concurrent RPing hobbies out there that are fundamentally different and incompatible with one another.<br/><br/>p.</blockquote>Now <strong>that's</strong> a fascinating observation.

I just want to hash out the idea behind this kind of response. It sounds like you have an clue, and I would be interested to here it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Personally, I don't buy it. I don't think that different gamers are all that different. I think that if you got a group of people together and hashed out a game everyone wanted to play, it would be fun, even if there were indi, trad, gamists, narrativists, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The only time there seems to be a conflict between gamers is when one side isn't talking or listening. Sometimes that happens due to assumptions. Other times I see it happen due to a sort of dogma (the only good rpg is D&amp;D, etc.). But mostly, it is just people being people.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that it is unfortunate that all too often the first answer people give when someone asks for advice about how to deal with the drama in their group is to leave/disband/split the group. I really don't think there are enough gaming groups out there to support this kind of philosophy...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182330/#Comment_182330" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T08:32:48+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  8:32AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Personally, I don't buy it.

I mean the idea that everyone can have fun together is a pretty big assumption to build the conversation on, and I think it's something that would really need to be agreed on or disagreed on.

But, really, have you stopped having fun because someone wanted to use a rule you thought was a crutch? Or have you wanted to abandon your play group because someone treated a rule in the book as optional and you saw it as mandatory?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I mean let's zoom in on a highly charged issue: alignment. If you liked D&amp;D (I don't know if you do) and you were invited to play in a group, and they said, "we don't use the alignment rules, we think they are dumb." Would you just get up and walk out? Probably not. But, you might want to argue about it and maybe change their mind, but probably not change anything.<br/>\n  Its a divisive issue, but I don't think its a deal breaker. Even though a lot of venom has been heaped on this one rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think what Paul is talking about is more of a competitive players vs dirty-hippy players kind of thing. These are two groups that have a hard time sharing the same space. But, to me, this division is artificial. I have found that there are very few players who would rather not play at all than play a game that is sub-par to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Don't get me wrong, they exist and on the internet are very vocal, but I don't think they are the majority, do you?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182333/#Comment_182333" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T08:38:57+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  8:38AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bret,<br/>\n  Yeah, I don't feel confident basing this thread on that assumption.<br/>\n  I know that my opinion is the minority, so there is no point in starting its own thread.<br/>\n  I just wanted to share my view point.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To get back to my OP, what do you think makes some people so defensive about the theory that a rule book can control them or even influence how they play?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182334/#Comment_182334" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T08:40:01+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  8:40AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd put it differently Dave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think those 2 items quoted above are completely 100% incompatable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think individual players can teach themselves how to enjoy spending time with each, but I don't think they can mesh together in a single game and I don't think players who are dedicated to one and avoid the other can ever play together nicely with their opposite for long (though they may sacrifice and compromise for social reasons for say a single shot con game...or a whimsical experiment).<br/>\n<br/>\nI happen to think that adherants to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> are a significant contributing factor to why roleplaying never caught on and grew.

Except, my experience in life has been that it is about compromise. The people that I admire, are those that are willing to compromise on all but the most ethical or critical of issues.<br/>\n  So, to say, "I like gamist games, but I had to compromise to play in a nar game" to me is a sign of a good person trying to have fun with their friends. Not a sign of someone doing something stupid or wrong. Its not a valid complaint to me. I mean, if you like those people, play with them, but don't set up an artificial boundary to having fun with your friends...<br/>\n  And if you don't know them, give them a chance, you might have fun if you lower your guard a little.<br/>\n  And if you don't like them, no rules, setting, play style or social contract will change that. Don't play with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does that make sense?

Okie dokie.<br/><br/>I think there's a RPing hobby that's all about playing out long-standing rituals with old social groups that have a very thorough understanding (possibly not elucidated) of how they work together. The system matters only to provide a common touchstone: <i>We're all agreeing to play HERO because we can all suss out the numbers and probabilities, and we know how to fudge and tweak to get somewhere comfortable.</i> Priority 1 is continuity and institutional memory: Hey, remember that Rolemaster game we played where Galfor the Dwarf played "toss the kobold?" Mechanics are nearly irrelevant for these folks, and they're carrying out their rituals despite -- not because of -- the rules. Are they having "fun"? You'd have to ask them. The ritual is fulfilling some kind of need, probably social.<br/><br/>There's an RPing hobby that's centered on buying books, reading, studying, posting to forums, and participating in the community in every way other than actually playing. This scene has always been big but the Internet is the great enabler. They're engaging their imagination on the page, not between players. Is this "really" roleplaying? I don't think the publishers mind. They're not harming anyone. I feel like this is the great silent majority of roleplaying.<br/><br/>There's an RPing hobby that's all about <i>playing the goddamned game</i>. The rules are the first and best authority, which is a necessary prerequisite for the very concept of "system mastery": <i>There has to be a system there to master</i>. You may see collectors in this hobby, but they're all about playing. You'll almost certainly see long-standing groups, but they're all about playing. This hobby is, to me, most akin to a hardcore boardgaming scene. This is, to me, a fairly recent phenomenon (although I've seen this priority back quite a ways -- probably early White Wolf is when it started standing apart from the ritual players). <br/><br/>Here's why they're incompatible.<br/><br/>The ritual players have nothing to say to the collectors, because they collect games for a totally different reason. They're on a quest to find the game that best enables them to fulfill their ritual. They start out rules-heavy, probably, and move to rules-light because they don't want rules to "get in the way of the story." <br/><br/>The ritual players have nothing to say to the "play the goddamned game" players for, hopefully, obvious reasons. The biggest incompatibility is that there's a conflict of interest between fulfilling the ritual of play and playing the game. Imagine going to a boardgaming convention and sitting down at a table for some Risk. Everyone else at the table knows each other, and they have a deep understanding that Mark always takes Europe because he has an agreement with Bill not to attack Asia. WTF? <br/><br/>The collectors have nothing to say to the play-the-game folks because, again, there's a conflict of interest. The collectors are there to talk about the fiction, the mechanics, the industry, designer gossip, all this social stuff that surrounds gaming but isn't actually gaming. The play-the-game folks are there to play.<br/><br/>Are there crossovers and edge cases? Of course. Nobody belongs to just one of these and I'm not talking identity politics. But based on a lot of years of participating, I don't see much meaningful interaction between them.<br/><br/>This also leaves out big swaths of RPing that conveniently exist outside most people's understanding of the hobby. What do LARPers have to say to book collectors? What do fanfic writers have to say to play-the-game folks? Shit, what do MET LARPers have to say to SCA folk? <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182358/#Comment_182358" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T09:33:15+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  9:33AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2008 9:41AM by Peter_Aronson.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I happen to think that adherants to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> are a significant contributing factor to why roleplaying never caught on and grew.

I mean, there can be a lot of other reasons for the relative popularity: ease of finding players/lack of need for other players; competitive vs cooperative (thanks <b>komradbob</b>); time required to play (yes, there are board games with similar demands, but they don't tend to be the most popular ones); complexity; the multi-session/on-going nature of many RPG campaigns (and yes, it happens in miniatures, too, but again tends to be the exception); etc.<br/><br/>However, I do think you have a point, but it has relatively little to do with <b>komradbob's</b> two axes, but rather with the nature of all but the most focused RPGs: RPGs are open-ended.  When you sit down to play most of the types of games you have cited, you know roughly what sort of things will happen and how to determine when you are done.  With RPGs, you often don't know <em>what's</em> going to happen, and you may <em>never</em> finish.  It's a much less tidy pastime.

I think its telling that single largest, best selling, most popular, RPG of all time has consistantly moved from being extremely open ended in its earliest incarnation to one short sprint away from being a board game in its current edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182369/#Comment_182369" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T09:43:44+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  9:43AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2008 9:45AM by Valamir.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, you know you're responsible for Brain Damaging half the state of Arizona, quit trying to play all innocent...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGrammatically, I should have written:  "Adherance to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is..."  which changes the meaning a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182370/#Comment_182370" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T09:44:43+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  9:44AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He's responsible for my tumor?

It seemed like an appropriate use of the term.<br>But, I am not sure if you answered my question.<br>Would you, personally, leave a game because the rules were treated differently than you expected (i.e., mandatory vs. optional)?<br>Dave M</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nI have in the past.<br><br/>I'll note that I'm a social fellow. I got into the hobby some 20 years back for social reasons and that's how I've stayed in it.<br/><br/>I'm one of those "the rules are my bitch" kind of people. I'm not "offended" by the idea of rules, nor am I "threatened" by the idea of following the rules in a book.<br/><br/>I only play games (rpgs, board, video, whatever) with folks I like. If I don't happen to know the people in the first place and they're the types to be all strict "by the book" types, chances are I'll politely leave the game. I don't feel a desperate need to play games no matter what. I've got a few friends that I won't play rpgs with either, because what I want from a game and what they want from a game is different.<br/><br/>It's no big deal.<br/><br/>I'm always kind of amazed how an rpg can come up with less than 20 people as playtesters and yet thousands of people are expected to have exactly the same goals in the game as that limited pool that playtested it.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, D&amp;D is somebody's houserules made official. Do lots of people dig it? Sure. Do lots of people play it hardcore-Rules-As-Written? Sure. I'm also pretty sure that just as many people (more?) are out there drifting the rules too.<br/><br/>Sometimes that rule drift is intentional and sometimes it isn't. For example, lots of people whined and bitched about how "fast" advancement was in 3rd ed D&amp;D compared to AD&amp;D. Funny thing is, it really wasn't. See, a lot of people apparently missed that in AD&amp;D you were supposed to award XP for gold/treasure as well as killing things. But plenty of "hardcore" GMs decided that was just way over the top so they houseruled it out. No XP for treasure. People show up and find this houserule in operation and think "that's the rules" and don't bother questioning it. 3rd Ed hits and folks are comparing a brand new system (Rules as Written) to their own drifted ways of running AD&amp;D and there's a whole chunk of bitching right there.<br/><br/>I can't speak for anyone else as to why they happen to treat rules the way they do. For me, it's because I don't feel obligated in any fashion to slavishly follow some chucklehead's idea of how I should have fun. I pick up a book and if it looks cool and seems to match the sort of thing I'm interested in, I'll get it. If I find something not working, I'll either see if other folks have had a similar issue or I'll just change it myself.<br/><br/>Heck, here's one thing that can force rule changes awfully quick: Number of players.<br/><br/>A game like In A Wicked Age? I picked it up and it seemed cool, but it's basically worthless to me. Why? Because right now if I want to run or play anything other than D&amp;D or a White Wolf game, I have _one_ player.<br/><br/>Most of these rpgs? They don't consider you having less than 4 players. And it's not like the indy/small press scene is much better. They _are_ better because the few games I know of that work for only 2 (or maybe 3) people come from the small press side in the first place. But it's not like anyone is really working to make their games friendly for small numbers of people.<br/><br/>So almost from the get go, you're going to have to start ignoring things and changing things in order to have a "good" game. Oh well, I suppose if you want to play D&amp;D by-the-book you can have your one player and have them play a second character and the GM can play a couple of NPCs to fill out the minimum of 4 that the game assumes. I've never seen folks really have fun like that though, and I certainly haven't bothered with it myself. I just change the rules until it works the way I want.<br/><br/>I'm frankly puzzled by the insistence that the rules be adhered to in such a strict fashion. I mean, if it's some sort of rpg tournament game or something where scores are being kept and all that? Sure I get it. You're competing, so you need to have a clear standard of behavior and interaction with rules in order to be able to judge "who's the best". But sitting around the kitchen table? Folks I hang with over the years can be a pretty competitive lot, but we haven't been competing when we sit down to play an rpg.<br/><br/>Heck, there haven't been that many strictly competitive rpgs done in the first place. AD&amp;D came about in part because of tournament play. After that...no "major" (as in sold in a gaming store) rpg springs to mind other than Rune. At least until the indy/small press scene popped up. Everyone I've ever known that wanted to do the competition thing got that out of their system with some other game (Magic, videogames, boardgames, sports, drinking, whatever).<br/><br/>Edit: I'll also note, I've moved around an awful lot over the last 20 years. So I don't have any of this "established group" thing going on. Every time I have to start over and find new people to hang with and new people to play with. Right now I'm in the process of moving to New Zealand, so there's a whole _other_ rpg culture I'm going to have to learn to interact with.<br/><br/>I also don't self-identify as a "gamer". RPGs just happen to be something I do, like weight lifting, running, reading a book and all sorts of other stuff.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182374/#Comment_182374" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T09:59:40+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  9:59AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris,<br/>\n  That is interesting.<br/>\n  Well, to help you become hopefully a little less puzzled, here is my approach. I generally play the game by the book. The reason is simple. My group generally doesn't read the rules. I would like it if they did. Therefore, I don't want to pull the rug out from under them by arbitrarily enforcing some rules and ignoring others. Of course, I do some house rules, but they are generally minimal (like using luck after the die are rolled, if there is a luck system and it doesn't already allow for that) and well communicated to the entire group.<br/>\n  And I am definitely not a competitive gamer, so that's not the origin.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As far as enforcement, I try not to be dogmatic about it, but I also don't like to fudge the rules or the rolls so, its a balancing act. Generally, as a GM, if I know the rules don't support a character's choice of actions very well, I will warn them before the dice hit the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, that's me and rules. Can you give me a similar treatment from your viewpoint? I really want to understand other players and how/why they play that way, so if you don't mind...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182393/#Comment_182393" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T10:47:38+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 10:47AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Why are they so threatened by this concept?

A lot of the players I know, they aren't influenced by the rulebooks. They play the exact same game over and over again regardless of what the game is actually called.

Things like how people got started in the hobby, the reason they've continued participating, heck, maybe even the rule set they started with and the style of the GM...<br/><br/>Me, I started with Red Box D&amp;D. A simple enough system. As time's gone on, I've played so many games I can't remember 'em all. I've learned that there's _always_ something that isn't covered by the rules. I actually learned that pretty quick.<br/><br/>Since there's always going to be something not covered by the rules, it means that the rules are really only functioning as "guide posts". More complicated rulesets are simply setting up more posts for a GM to guide the game by, but the GM (and players) are still going to wind up venturing off the beaten track.<br/><br/>For me, this meant not only that the rules are guideposts but also that there's a limit to the number of rules that are useful overall. As more and more rules accumulate, more and more things are "defined" but any one group is only going to be using a fraction of those rules in the first place at any given time.<br/><br/>So I tend towards systems that are on the lighter side of the rules continuum. It means I and the players have less to try and hold in our heads at any given point in time, and if something comes up in the course of play, we can address it and move on.<br/><br/>No one person (this can include the rulebook) is the sole arbiter of how we're going to have fun. As a group of people, we're already compatible. We're sitting down to play a game of a particular sort, so we're "compatible" there too.<br/><br/>I guess it's that social contract thing. I expect to be able to work stuff out with the people at the table. The rulebook is helpful for keeping everyone on the same page, but if something's not working... we'll change it. Because what we're doing at the table isn't being created _by_ the rules, the rules are simply helping us to shape what takes place.<br/><br/>Currently PDQ is my "go to" game system. I'm perfectly happy to play a variety of games, all the way up to Unisystem. After Unisystem, I consider the rules to be too heavy and don't have any interest in it. I'll _play_ something heavier than Unisystem, but I'm not going to bother learning the rules. Which means that someone else is going to have to carry the burden of me not knowing the rules. If that's fine with 'em, then it costs me nothing. Most people aren't down with that though.<br/><br/>I expect people at the table to eventually have an idea what they're doing. If I tell 'em to make an attack roll or a skill roll, I don't expect to have to explain that process after 3 months of playing a game every week. After that? I'm pretty easy going. My rule of thumb is, if I don't know the rule I'll flip through the book. If I can't find the rule in a minute or less, I'm making something up. If I find the rule and it looks pointlessly complicated (Attacks of Opportunity to beat an often pounded drum), then I'm making something up. If a player has a suggestion for how to handle it and it sounds cool? We'll try it out.<br/><br/>After the game, I'll evaluate how it turned out and make a decision about what to do in the future. Then I'll make a note of it on a sheet of paper (if I need to) and then let everyone know where I stand on things. I expect players to tell me if it works for them or not, and if it doesn't then we'll figure something else out.<br/><br/>If I reach a point where it's just a hassle? I'll end the game. I did that back in November for the Witch Hunter: Invisible World game I was running. People were willing to try it because it looked similar enough to White Wolf games that there'd be a minimal barrier to entry in terms of system mastery was concerned. I ran the game for a while and just wasn't happy with the way things were going. I modified a few rules and it made it better but still wasn't really satisfying. So I sent an email that said, "Folks seem to be willing to play Witch Hunter, but they're not really _pumped_for the next game. And there's some stuff that just bogs down. So unless people are actively enjoying the game, I'm going to pull the plug." I knew one person wasn't into it and I only got a response from one person that said they were really grooving on it, so down the game went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182408/#Comment_182408" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T11:40:58+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 11:40AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The purpose of a rule is to make people think before they break it.

Here's two instances:<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> - I was DMing a D&amp;D game for a group.  One of the players had played a lot of D&amp;D, but almost exclusively with his own group.  The party was caught up in a fight, and losing.  One of the players got a big grin, and I knew he'd thought of an idea.  When it came to his turn, I asked him what his character was doing, and he replied that his character was going to run up to the Big Bad they were fighting, then pull out his (the character's, not the Big Bad's) wand of fire and break it.<br/><br/>I did a double-take.  "What?  Are you sure that's what you want to do?"  He indicated that he was sure, and, puzzled, I replied.  "Okay.  You run up to him and break your wand."  Then I turned to the next player and asked what she wanted to do.<br/><br/>The player who'd just broken the wand said, "What?!  Aren't you going to roll damage for that?"<br/><br/>"Damage for what?"<br/><br/>"When you break a wand, it explodes, and does 1d6 damage for each charge still in it!"<br/><br/>"No... only the Staff of the Magi and Staff of Power do that.  A normal wand doesn't."<br/><br/>"Yes it does!"<br/><br/>... to make a long story short, the group he'd played with had applied the "retributive strike" ability those two items had to all charged items... and the player fundamentally believed that that was a standard rule.  He asked me to show him where there was a rule that said that didn't happen.  I told him there wasn't such a rule, but I could show him where it said the Staff of the Magi and Staff of Power did.  I also offered to let him change his action.  He wouldn't hear of it, cursed me out, and left.<br/><br/>So... a difference in the rules definitely had a major impact on his actions -- and it wound up ruining both his and my fun for the evening, and I'd feel safe in saying the rest of the group as well.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> - Back in college, some people in my dorm started a GURPS game, and I decided I wanted to play a social-skills kind of character.  Lots of skill points in Fast-Talk, Diplomacy, Streetwise, Area Knowledges, etc.  The GM had told us that it was going to be a city-based game, with lots of intrigue, so I figured I'd have plenty of chances to shine.<br/><br/>When it actually came to play, however, the GM didn't use rules at all for social stuff -- instead, he just hand-waved it, basing success and failure on how good a job of acting out the persuasion/intimidation/seduction/whatever he thought you did.  I was a socially inept and insecure geek.  The party's main warrior-type was played by a theater major who was great at talking people up.  Thus, even though his character had taken no social skills, he wound up doing all the social interaction stuff for the party.<br/><br/>I didn't storm out, but after the first two sessions, I knew that my character wasn't going to be able to do what I'd designed him to do -- and someone else who'd put no points at all into those things could do them.  Unhappy, but too shy to really talk to the GM about it back then, I simply quit going to the game.<br/><br/>So... yes to both questions, for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182429/#Comment_182429" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T12:53:17+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 12:53PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>"I am not the rule book's bitch, the rules are my bitch"<br/>....the more "me too" responses I received, the more I thought about this phenomenon.

The reality is, that when your concept of the game you were playing changed, you should have talked to the GM and come up with a compromise, you know.

Flat out will not. But I have run modified 3rd Ed games and had fun doing so and the players all seemed to enjoy themselves as well.<br/><br/>But the game is going to _really_ struggle if I turn around and ignore the combat system that's built and try and run a campaign that's focused on politics, seduction, and investigation. It's not impossible to do it, but the default skill system really doesn't support it (in my opinion). Now, I could probably hack the combat system over into some sort of a social combat system, but.. geez, why bother?<br/><br/>The small press side of rpgs is focused a lot more on "hot rodding" than simply making a car. Hmmm. Maybe that's not quite accurate. What I'm trying to get at is that rpgs that you're going to find coming from people that hang out in this forum (or that folks in this forum are going to tend to be excited about) are on the "hand made, individually customized" side of crafting stuff, whereas the "big" or "popular" ("traditional crap" some stuffy people might call it) are all about the mass-produced object.<br/><br/>Now, you can have a mass produced Honda or you can have a mass produced Corvette (amongst other things).<br/><br/>"Rules are my bitch" people are going to be the ones that are inclined to do stuff like put a spolier on their Honda, maybe chrome it up a bit and so on. Crazy ones are in there messing around with the engine and doing lord knows what to it.<br/><br/>Folks that are inclined to stay more by the book are going to be the ones that go ahead, suck it up, and get the Corvette. The Honda Hackers may be able to get their Honda to perform... well, not like a 'vette (Chevette is more likely) but better than a stock Honda, but it's still a different animal than a genuine Corvette.<br/><br/>Small press / Indy folks are the ones with the custom built... well, dang just about everything. It might be a lovingly created Model T, it might be a Tesla Roadster, it might be a Carmengia with a Porche engine dropped into it. All kinds of wacky stuff.<br/><br/>Depending on the "starting base", folks can have some absolutely crap games or really awesome ones.<br/><br/>I think some folks that are into modding stuff out (Honda Hackers) miss the fact that while they might be able to hack a Honda to do all sorts of stuff in the first place... maybe they really ought to consider starting from a better base in the first place.<br/><br/>In other words, Paul for example feels that his 3:16 session was flat. What's 3:16 about? Killing bugs. I'm willing to be that while his session might have felt flat to him, if he'd tried doing it under D&amp;D 3rd Ed, it'd have probably been digging through the dirt like a drill looking for oil.<br/><br/>In my case, even though I'll drift rules or ignore some outright if I (and the players) feel it's going to make a better game, I try to make sure I'm operating from a solid base in the first place.<br/><br/>So the mechanics _are_ having a definite influence. You could even say that it's a significant influence since system will determine what sort of games I even consider running under the system in question. If I wanted to run a Shadowrun style game, even though PDQ is my go to system, I'd probably use Unisystem for it instead. Why? Because there's an element of gun/cyber porn going on with Shadowrun style games. Chances are that's going to be what folks are going to be drawn to at least partially. Unisystem is going to give more of that fiddly gun/cyber porn feeling than PDQ. Sure, I could hack something like the latest version of PDQ (Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies) to do Shadowrun. And it'd make for a fun game (I think). But it's going to be in a whole different fashion than the Unisystem hack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182543/#Comment_182543" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T23:51:32+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 11:51PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well it really depends on how you play a game. When I was a kid my brother DMed a game that was based around a 2ed PHB, a 1ed DMG (which he never read) and a biiiiiiig stack of monster books from any old source. The only thing the DM really used any of the rules for was combat rules and monster stats. Everything else was completely made up and there was a lot of that. There were combat encounters on a trampoline surrounded by a lake of acid in which my character turned into a were-hippo. I really don't think that the D&amp;D rules we were using had much at all to do with producing that kind of zany wackiness <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>There's very very little that rules can do that can't be done better by having just the right kind of GM and just the right kind of players. However, what a good game does is facilitate all of the good stuff (what "good stuff" you're talking about depends wildly from person to person) so that people who aren't wacky geniuses can have great adventures and players can be encouraged to act in certain ways.<br/><br/>For a lot of the grognards they've been playing X game forever and they're really good at having fun with that game. They really don't need any Indie rules in order to have lots of RP fun, they're doing it fine right now. What they lose sight of is that the VAST VAST majority of people who have ever played X game no longer do (for example what percentage of the people who have ever played D&amp;D and are alive still play RPGs today?) and there are probably some good reasons for that. The people who've been playing a game for decades and can really make it work are a small self-selecting minority.<br/><br/>And  then there's the rest of us. I absolutely adored playing D&amp;D with my brother because each session turned into one long escapade of insanity. For year and years after that I played some RPGs but I never really hit on that feeling again and most of the games I played felt like slow motion Computer RPGs with very bad graphics. That is until I played a session of Spirit of the Century and I had my character leaping out of a biplane with a bungee cord tied around his waist in order to attack a zeppelin with a rapier. And the old zany insanity was back, and it sure as hell wasn't because of the specific players and GM since they were pretty much the same people who had played in our previous campaign (which was strictly mediocre).<br/><br/>Some people need more help than others to bring out all of the good stuff that RPGs are capable of. The sort of people who are still playing old school RPGs after all these years are either very stubborn, doing so for social reasons or have the sort of players/GM who can bring out the good stuff without the rules helping or they wouldn't still be playing old school RPGs after all these years. For the rest of us (and probably most people in the world) we need some help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182547/#Comment_182547" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T00:38:10+00:00" title="December 10, 2008 12:38AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>\u0e22\u0e19<sub>You know how the most broken people you know are all pursuing careers in psychotherapy and counseling?

The rules need to know only him)<br/><br/>There's a lot to unpack, and unfortunately, I see too much Excluded Middle being served with a slice of Metaphor Pie to be of too much help to conversation. But, I can say one thing that bugs me about the "playing by the rules/being the rules' bitch" topic.<br/><br/>Every once in a while: Not all the time, and not even "often", of "commonly", I see a report of some game (usually hippie, else sometimes even trad) where someone describes a bad experience they had running or playing the game.<br/><br/>Shortly into said report, it becomes clear that they were totally off the tracks when it comes to the rules. I don't mean "ignoring encumberance", I'm thinking more of a great example (can't find it) on RPGNet where they played InSpectres at a Con or something, and the dude running it ran it exactly like Ghostbusters: And all the "unique" things about the game, like the confessional scenes (and some other things, I forget; but mostly the confessionals) were discarded because the GM thought they were dumb.<br/><br/>After which, the player complained that InSpectres wasn't fun, because it was like a watered-down version of Ghostbusters. When in truth it was like a watered-down version of Ghostbusters because the group (well, mostly the GM being an ass; the core issue was that it was a con game, rather than a game with friends somewhere) decided not to use any of the unique rules or playstyles the game is built upon.<br/><br/>That cycle, the "try the game; discard/change major rules; have a sucky time; the time would have been at least bearably more interesting if those rules were followed; player/GM then complains about the *game* being unfun" thing, I think is retarded, and why I think rules mean something sometimes.<br/><br/>Other than that, there's not much to say from my court. It comes down to the chaos of individual tables, people, relationships, then how the rules help them get their game on from there. I'm not that great with sweeping generalizations.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182637/#Comment_182637" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T13:06:14+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  1:06PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite><br/>"I am not the rule book's bitch, the rules are my bitch"<br/><br/>Why are they so threatened by this concept?

The real issue at work here isn't really anything to do with individuality or coarse language or being threatened or whatnot.  The issue is responsibility.<br/><br/>A game session might suck.  It might be excellent.  Either way, people are going to decide who is responsible.<br/><br/>One group might say "Well, heck, these rules are just terrible.  We all tried our best, but there's just nothing good in here."<br/><br/>Another group might say "It's all Bob's fault.  He was running the game, it's his game, and he failed in his duty to entertain us."  Alternatively, "Wow, Bob is awesome.  He's running an awesome game and the game is awesome and he is awesome."<br/><br/>(Of course, these are two extremes, and lots of people fall somewhere in the spectrum.)<br/><br/>I think what's actually in evidence here is the palpable disdain the people in Group <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> often have for the people in Group <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  When people have embraced this sense of duty, they take it very seriously.  Any perceived attack against it, however slight, is taken very seriously.<br/><br/>There's a whole mess of dynamics at play here; if you're going to try to unravel some of them, I wish you all the best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182757/#Comment_182757" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T22:22:52+00:00" title="December 10, 2008 10:22PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm just going to name one dynamic that should probably close the whole discussion down and end it forever - the decision to follow or not follow a rule belongs to a player at the table, so any credit for making good play with that decision or blame for bad play with that decision is - ultimately - the player's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182811/#Comment_182811" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T08:17:20+00:00" title="December 11, 2008  8:17AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD: Not disagreeing, but expanding on your thought.

Imagine a pick up game with folks who haven't played for years. In that case, those rituals are good. They let the group get playing fast.<br/><br/>A radically different style, to get playing as fast, would require a point person who knows all the rules anyway, which, regardless of GM/Player structure, is still out in that same territroy anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182818/#Comment_182818" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T08:56:08+00:00" title="December 11, 2008  8:56AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm thinking about the lack-of-purposeful-choice element as being the bad part.

I'm gonna talk about me.  From my perspective, the play of the group is the thing.    The text, the rulebook; that's a kit full of methods people playing can use in order to put pressure on the play, to make things happen.<br/><br/>I say no in Dogs in the Vineyard, and set counter-stakes, too.  This bothers me not one bit; if it bothers someone else, they can go stuff it.<br/><br/>Games that I've written occasionally strike people as really weirdly framed - because they are written as a collection of tools.  That bit at the start of the book, where it talk about "how to roleplay"?  <b>That</b> is the game.  Everything after that is tinkertoys for use by a healthy group.<br/><br/>Applying mechanics to play, and doing it well, is a matter of group skill; it is <b>how</b> we make our own fun.<br/><br/>I see no reason to write games that assume the group to be incompetent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
