If I can get the pitch down then all I need to do is deliver on that pitch.<br/><br/>Notes<br/>I write notes and outlines of how the game will play, nothing at this time is what I would consider "first draft", it's mostly to remind myself of the rules at the table. these notes are developed and researched, math and other things are puzzled out.<br/><br/>Initial build<br/>This is when I make everything required to play the game, for storygames or rpgs this would be a character sheet a rules outline and whatever scraps of setting i think will help. for other games it's decks of cards, boards and bits.<br/><br/>let me again stress how important it is that nothing at this point is considered "first draft".<br/><br/>Playtest<br/>I play the initial build with my group, I know them very well, I understand their tastes and styles and know how to frame their feedback and make it useful. <br/><br/>I do this because it's almost impossible to recreate the brain space and atmosphere of an actual game. This stress of play always finds things that can be adjusted.<br/><br/>Development and playtest cycle<br/>Any changes I feel necessary are made to the outline and components. At this point I play test again. I do this enough until I get what I want from the game.<br/><br/>Initial draft<br/>Few games ever make it here. Once the game is where I want it, I start writing first draft stuff. Expand my outline and write rules into a book and generally prepare the game for consumption as well as I can.<br/><br/>Product testing<br/>I hand the game to a few people who have yet to play it and see what they think. Their feedback still must be filtered but these few people will still catch the most glaring errors in the presentation. I revise a little at this point to make sure the presentation is effective. When i'm happy I release the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313195/#Comment_313195" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T10:07:14+00:00" title="February 18, 2011 10:07AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can read all about mine <a href="http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/2006/04/what-is-troys-12-step-process.html" rel="nofollow">HERE.</a>  In the five years that have passed since I wrote that, not much has changed for me.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313242/#Comment_313242" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T14:03:02+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  2:03PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2011 3:13PM by kobutsu.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I've been thinking about what we at <a href="http://games.transneptune.net" rel="nofollow">Transneptune</a> have been doing, and I've come to this conclusion:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have the spark of an idea.</li>\n<li>Gather influences from other media.</li>\n<li>Perform a dissection of what the genre under consideration does.</li>\n<li>Get an image of what we want play to look like.</li>\n<li>Play with paper and dice and cards and stuff.</li>\n<li>Come up with first draft of rules, basically a pretty raw SRD.</li>\n<li>Play with those rules and see if it feels right.</li>\n<li>Repeat 4 through 7 until it feels right.</li>\n<li>Write up as clear a draft as we can and pass it off to people to try.</li>\n<li>Edit while they do so.</li>\n<li>See if their feedback revealed any d'oh moments.</li>\n<li>Repeat 9 through 11 until there are no d'oh moments.</li>\n<li>Eventually, publish.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, in there, draw influences from other games, and make sure no other games are doing what we want to do, but those are just constant background to how we personally think and live on the net.</p>\n<p><strong>ETA:</strong></p>\n<p>Also in there is a quick statistical analysis of any random elements, but that's intrinsic to coming up with a dice (or whatever) mechanic.
