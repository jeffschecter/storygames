                    Howdy there folks! Development of Mythos, my game of horror, character exploration, and shared creation of a horror setting. I know horror possibly isn't the best descriptor, since what the game can do and encourage is closer to being the middle ground of speculative fiction, before horror and sci-fi and fantasy all spun off from each other. So, basically...its about Lovecraft with the Cthulhu Mythos itself pulled out and replaced the world the players create as a group, mixed with a Silent Hill-level dose of surreality and personal development. <br/>
<br/>
You can find my rough, nasty, unedited beast of drafting here:<br/>
http://outofmind.pbwiki.com/Mythos<br/>
<br/>
What am having a problem with at the moment is how to go about setting up a resolution system. I want it to have a low barrier to understanding, but still be somewhat mechanically interesting. I have three ideas on the table right now.<br/>
<br/>
1) Task-based resolution, which is what I have been drafting now. It is a percentile system built around the division of tests into Minor, Significant and Major levels, inspired by Unknown Armies, but choosing to focus on the three step division for resolution and effects. The body of the text would only refer to M/S/M, since the mechanical definition, regardless of what was being defined, was the same across the board.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) Narrative-control resolution, such as...well, a lot of indie games. This setup involves taking the Body/Mind/Soul stats off the sheet and replacing them with a more broad set of Traits and a list of unattached, un-numbered Talents that would define areas of competence within those Traits. The M/S/M division could be retained and used by peeling off the second digit of each of the numbers and polishing a little. <br/>
<br/>
3) Ridiculously freeform narrative-control resolution. -Almost- the same as #2, but with the key difference being that, aside from the Passions section of things all aspects of the character would be a big undefined shape to which the numbers would then be applied, akin to Universalis, the first draft of Cthonian, or UA skills.<br/>
<br/>
A subquestion on the last two potentials is how to go about using those numbers, for example:<br/>
<br/>
a) Use a die + add Traits/stats/Talents/modifiers to the roll itself.<br/>
b) The Trait/Talent/Modifier number indicates how -many- randomizers to use: dice to roll, cards to draw, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I have equal love for each of these three setups, but don't want to dilute the game text by including multiple resolution systems. So...my question to you folks is: which do you think would be more broadly appealing -and- easiest to get one's head around. I may not have described them very well, and if so please drop a request for explication, and I'll do better. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help,<br/>

                            Hey dude:<br/><br/>I definitely want to encourage you to also post on other RPG design forums, like The Forge:<br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?board=2.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?board=2.0</a><br/>There's more people there, which means more feedback (while some folks toss nascent designs here and there on these forums, I just want to encourage everyone to remember that game design on the forums really is outside the scope of the site).<br/><br/>But since you ask a specific question ("which do you think would be more broadly appealing -and- easiest to get one's head around"), that's pretty solid. <br/><br/>In the end, I think you should seriously, SERIOUSLY go with the one that appeals the most to you, and take the time to carefully explain whichever mechanic to your audience.  For example, most new gamers don't understand task resolution. Most older gamers don't understand narrative-control resolution. <br/><br/>The crowning answer is, "go with the one you feel for the most" (if the classic style works for you the most, definitely go for it!). But whichever you choose, provide a lot of examples and exceptions in your explanation text.                        </div>

                            (Sorry about that, I think I misinterpreted the description of Praxis in the sticky...which illustrates why I shouldn't post on a limited amount of sleep.)<br/>
<br/>
As for posting on the Forge, I have in the past, and am in the process of sticking this up over there at the moment. However, I seem to get far more views than replies there (which may in fact be my fault for failing to ask clear questions) so I thought I would ask here as well.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the one I like the most...that is the reason for the waffling. I like all three for different reasons, but this project is strongly looking like #2 and #3 would be the most well-suited for it. I will probably wind up writing both up and running playtests with 'em (since the main numerical difference between the two is that #1 uses percentiles which are most often two digit numbers, while #2 and #3 employ numbers that will most often be single digit. Shave the second digit off the percentiles, and there you go!)<br/>
<br/>
As for their appeal to me, I tend to spend more of my mental time in "narrative resolution is fun!" land than any other, but I know I differ from many of my players (and potential players) in that. Hence the waffling! ^.^;<br/>

                            No prob.<br/><br/>Two things about the pervy hippie nar game Forgie crowd (of which I am a happy member): <br/><br/>1) Make sure not to feel any guilt about adopting "traditional" gaming structures or styles if that's what you're into.  I mean, be reflective, think about things like Morningstar's question ("Does there need to be a GM?") or "Task or Conflict resolution?", etc. So put a little thought into it. But then, if you realize that you want the traditional style, go with that; just having made the attempt to reflect on it means that your design will be tighter for it.<br/><br/>Here, in your case it sounds like the Nar stuff is more of what you want anyway. But just wanted to let you know that there's no need to feel bad about not being all innovative and stuff. ;-)<br/><br/>2) Solid, solid examples, or even laundry lists of examples, help traditional gamers a great deal. Seriously, half my gaming group freezes up in Dogs or other games where there are blanks for skills where you're supposed to fill in the blanks with "Anything you want!", because they're not used to that sort of thing. If your Option Three is to have blanks where the players fill in anything they want, make sure you provide a lot of provocative examples that players can use to make their own. It will break them out of any brainfreeze.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/>-Andy                        </div>

I do -like- traditional gaming structures. I am filled with tremendous amounts of love for Call of Cthulhu, Unknown Armies, and all the other random things I find passing through the used bookstore near here (such as almost everything put out for original Chill for like $10). Traditional gaming is fun, and one of my big pluses towards the system used in Cthulhu Live, for example, is that combat is rather "game-y" in how it is played out, even in a narrative game. ^.~ <br/>
<br/>
About the examples, I am well aware from running Forgite games for my local group. The first couple of times there was a bit of uncertainty in how to handle things, but I've got a solution to that in the newly-forming chargen chapter. "Guideline" traits with a label like "You probably ought to be able to do something related to these to enjoy this game" are probably going to be included if I use #3. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the reply. :)<br/>
