An RPG? Story game? War game?<br/><br/>The closest description I can come up with is a continuous, ten-hour geekgasm. <br/><br/>One of our players couldn't make it to our regular Jedi in the Vineyard game, so I suggested something that had been brewing in my head for a while: Create two characters with the DitV rules, then pit them against each other in an all-out conflict. <br/><br/>Only each character is an army, and the conflict? It's a space battle. <br/><br/>Also, we would zoom in during key points in the battle, like right after a major See and/or Raise, and take the roles of the characters actually in the thick of things. So if some high-up commander sent out the fighter planes, the army makes the Raise and maybe the other army makes a See and we each make up a pilot on the spot (<a href="http://swg.stratics.com/content/gameplay/characters/randomname.php" rel="nofollow">The Star Wars Random Name Generator</a> was a lifesaver), zoom right into where the fighter pilots are bantering furiously to cover up pre-launch jitters, put on some rock music, and go kick ass. Then, when that scene's played out we zoom out and get back into Raise and See mode. <br/><br/>When I thought about it in my head, I thought it would be pretty fun. I was wrong. <br/><br/>It was <i>crazy fucking</i> fun. <br/><br/>Our sessions usually go on for, eh, four hours. Five hours if we all have the time. Today we played for ten hours straight, and played out a goddamned space battle in one day, from beginning to end. <br/><br/>During the zoom-in sequences the three of us played happy-go-lucky fighter pilots who made the ultimate sacrifice, two cruel and ambitious Sith lords whose hatred for the Republic was only rivalled by their hatred of each other, a Republic admiral torn between his sense of duty and affection for his men, a Jedi Knight who gave her life to earn a crucial three hours, a hot-headed young Sith who would later turn Jedi (a PC in the main campaign), Mon Calamari technicians captured and forced to work for the Sith, a bunch of of easy-going and likeable Sith commandos, two offbeat Jedi-in-training who took over the enemy flagship not by fighting, but by hacking into its system... the list goes on. <br/><br/>It was just this whole panoply of humanity caught in the impossibility called war, their emotions, relationships, and destinies intertwining against this gigantic epic backdrop. It was insane. The marvel isn't that we spent ten hours on this, it's that we actually finished this thing in ten hours over IRC. <br/><br/>I think a big part of the fun was that we already had an established campaign and pretty in-depth characters to draw from. This battle was set a few years before the campaign so a lot of events that we only mentioned in the setting material were played out in the... whatever it was we did... today. That in turn added whole new worlds of meaning to campaign events, too. Also, some of the major zoom-in characters were PCs or important NPCs in the campaign, so knowing their futures added layers of emotion and nuance to everything. <br/><br/>It was just so... amazing. I am on such a high right now, and I still have no name for what it was I spent the last ten hours of my life doing. All I know is, it was so fun it's scary.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77312/#Comment_77312" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T06:56:33+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  6:56AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you lay out the crazy f***ing fun part in sort of a break down of steps, because that sounds pretty darn neat.<br/><br/>I'm talking about the steps where you go from one focus to the next, drilling in and out of the scale of resolution.

The Raises and Sees usually took place in the bridges of the respective flagships, with the high commander of each army making the call, for instance, "send out the Jedi." Then I'd ask the players if this was something they were interested in zooming into. If yes (with the Jedi, of course, it was YES!), we'd cut straight to where the Jedi were getting ready to board the assault ship. Sometimes I would ask which point of the action they'd like to jump to, sometimes the players  make suggestions, and sometimes they'd request specific zoom-ins. <br/><br/>When the zoom-in sequence was briefly set up, or while we set up the scene, we'd each make up a character to play (usually just name, race, maybe a few words of history), or grab one out of the existing arsenal if a major PC or NPC from the main campaign was involved. Occasionally one of us would forego making a character if the scene was short or if there was no room for more characters. Then we just went and roleplayed the hell out of the scene. <br/><br/>There was just the one big-ass Conflict, though, no mini-conflicts in zoom-in mode. We played I think close to twenty characters over the course of the battle, we couldn't possibly stat them all and have Conflicts for everyone. Instead we took the outcome of the See and Raise in zoom-out mode as a rough guideline of how the zoom-in sequence would go. <br/><br/>For instance, at one point the Republic high commander, Admiral Leverier, Raised 4 and 7 to send out Jedi to capture the enemy flagship. A brief zoom-in sequence with the Jedi waiting   to be deployed was actually part of the Raise for this move. In response, the Sith high commander, Darth Priat, used the enmity of his subordinate, Darth Cedess, and tricked him so Cedess would disobey Priat's express orders and intercept the Jedi instead. We cut to Darth Cedess's bridge to play out the result of that ploy. Darth Cedess took the bait right away (the two Sith lords were actually played by the same guy--we were a little worried about his mental health towards the end <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> and Saw Leverier's Raise with 8 and 3, so when we zoomed in to the Jedi actually heading for the enemy flagship to play out the results of the Raise and See, we agreed Darth Cedess would indeed intercept the Jedi. Actually he had to, for reasons of campaign history, but that's another topic altogether. <br/><br/>It got really confusing at one point because we were switching back and forth between characters so much, especially since the player nicknamed 'SithSwarm' might be playing a Republic captain or the one nicknamed 'RepublicArmy' might be playing a Sith commando. We got around this by occasionally adding a brief note about who was speaking at the moment, for instance: [Masati, Republic Fighter Pilot] "Hot damn!" One player was very good about flagging his lines this way, another just did it at the beginning of a scene, and I usually didn't bother and just added 'Calena said this, Lokrach said that' novel-style. All three approaches worked. <br/><br/>[Warning! Warning! GeekBragging ahead! Warning!]<br/><br/>For dice, we use a dice script I made for DitV, which makes the whole process pretty smooth. Basically, if someone nicknamed RepublicArmy typed\n<blockquote>1d4 Tension with the Republic High Command</blockquote>\nThe script would respond with: \n<blockquote>RepublicArmy's result: 1d4 (3)<br/>RepublicArmy's results list: 3<br/>RepublicArmy's dice rolled: 1d4 Tension with the Republic High Command</blockquote>\nLater on, if he rolled in addition\n<blockquote>2d6 Inexperienced but eager fighter pilots</blockquote>\nThe results pile up like this: \n<blockquote>RepublicArmy's result: 2d6 (2, 3)<br/>RepublicArmy's results list: 3, 2, 3<br/>RepublicArmy's dice rolled: 1d4 Tension with the Republic High Command, 2d6 Inexperienced but eager fighter pilots</blockquote>\nAnd later the player can erase dice from the list when he Raises or Sees. \n<blockquote>Remove 3 and 3 to see that smug bastard's raise!</blockquote>\n<blockquote>RepublicArmy's results list: 2<br/>RepublicArmy's dice rolled: 1d4 Tension with the Republic High Command, 2d6 Inexperienced but eager fighter pilots</blockquote>\nThere are also functions to add specific numbers to the list (for instance when you removed a die result by mistake), sort the dice results by order of size or in reverse, and to add, remove, and change the contents of the 'dice rolled' list. Oh, and of course an NPC function so that if RepublicArmy typed\n<blockquote>1d4 Poor supplies &lt;SithSwarm&gt;</blockquote>\nThe script would reply\n<blockquote>SithSwarm's result: 1d4 (4)<br/>SithSwarm's results list: 6, 4, 8, 3, 1, 4<br/>SithSwarm's dice rolled: 2d8 Sith assault force under Darth Cedess, 1d6 Captured Mon Calamari engineers, 1d6 Droid army, 2d6 Mandalorian shock troops, 1d4 Poor supplies</blockquote>\nAll dice manipulation, including Raises and Sees, can be made for the NPC just by using the name in pointy brackets. It's a handy way to keep track of Fallout, too, especially coupled with the function that forces the script not to roll the dice but only list the content of it. The signal for that is using a ! in the roll, like 3d4!<br/><br/>Using this little (okay, actually pretty large) script makes using the DitV dice mechanics on IRC very pain-free. I couldn't imagine trying to run it online otherwise. <br/><br/>Okay, sorry about that. It was Halfjack's fault, you know--you do not give a geek an opening to brag about her work. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77376/#Comment_77376" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T17:34:16+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  5:34PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andrew Kenrick</cite>That sounds like my kinda fun!

We didn't have any real idea what to do with Relationships, for instance, so we interpreted it loosely as "outside factors." That was a mistake, I think. It really watered down the meaning of giving the Sith fleet the "complicated community" background. (More on that in a moment.) "Poor supplies 1d4" should have been a Trait, and the magnetic storm would have worked better as an instant Belonging. That's another rule we completely forgot about--d'oh! Missed a gold mine right there.<br/><br/>Pre-deployed cameras and the detached force should have been Traits, too, or maybe a Belonging for the cameras. Overall the effect was that the Sith fleet could bring in these huge Relationship dice without the chaotic internal tension that such dice should have brought into the narration, and ended up being way overpowered. (Aren't they always, though? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The PC Backgrounds in the original rules translated pretty smoothly into fleet Backgrounds. The Republic fleet was, as you can see, an elite force hand-picked for a highly important mission. The Sith fleet, on the other hand, is obviously ragtag, though bigger. (Compare the Body stats of the two fleets.) This difference in composition goes straight to the heart of the conflict, or the Conflict as it were. This, in turn, goes to the million-dollar question of "who won."<br/><br/>The driving power of the Conflict came from the stakes we set. See, the Battle of Centares was something that already existed in the campaign setting, mentioned briefly when I wrote about an NPC's pre-campaign death. In the brief write-up I said Calena Hallack was partly credited with the Republic's "victory" at Centares. So how could we get around this without holding back punches to get the "right" result?<br/><br/>Yeah, easy question. Stakes-setting. No matter who won the Republic would take Centares from the Sith, which is easy enough to spin into victory with the war propaganda engines going full power. However, the <i>real</i> stakes of the battle were actually quite different from what history remembers. Darth Priat didn't give a damn about holding Centares; he didn't have the supplies or the manpower to do so. Admiral Leverier didn't give a damn about holding Centares; his real mission was to pass through Centares with minimal damage to his fleet to join up with another, waiting fleet for a crushing assault on the Sith. <br/><br/>Now look at the very different composition of the two fleets. Darth Priat didn't care about most of his fleet any more than he did about Centares. Composed of the dregs of the Outer Rim, poorly disciplined and put together, many of them drafted by force from occupied planets, to him they were just a drain on precious resources. But they could be used for one valuable purpose--mutual destruction with the superior Republic forces. Darth Priat valued two things about his fleet: Darth Cedess' assault force and the detached force. These were the only parts worth preserving, and everything else was expendable to the man who saw war as a chess game. <br/><br/>Admiral Leverier, on the other hand, cared too much about his fleet. Not only were they the biggest asset for the mission at hand, the guy really cared about his men and shared a deep bond with them. And soon he would have to watch as Darth Priat wantonly wasted the lives under his command to do as much damage to the Republic fleet as humanly possible. <i>That</i> was the heart of the conflict, the driving force of the drama between these two very different men, armies, and philosophies. <br/><br/>The stakes were set accordingly. If the Republic won, their fleet would sail through Centares in one piece and join up with the other fleet. If the Sith won, Darth Priat would succeed in his tactic of mutual destruction and really damage the other fleet while wasting most of his own. Either way the Republic fleet would survive (Darth Priat knew from the start he couldn't prevent that with what he had) and would take Centares (Darth Priat didn't want to keep it anyway), which is sort of a victory. A pyrrhic one if the Republic lost the Conflict. <br/><br/>With the stakes set this way the players went fast and furious, no distortions, and as sure as hell no holding back. The Sith won. Leverier's fleet took heavy losses and most of Darth Priat's fleet was decimated. Priat gathered up the real core of his fleet and withdrew from Centares, while Leverier was forced to stay and regroup. It was fantastically great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77580/#Comment_77580" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T17:31:24+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  5:31PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome.

A blow-by-blow account would be pretty boring, so maybe some highlights and a translation of a portion of the transcript for a sample of how we did things. <br/><br/>As for the importance of the zoom-in sequences... that's a variable matter. I guess a lot of those scenes were color, though there was more than dialogue. You know, dogfights in space, lightsaber duels, the desperate engine room technobabble, the whole shebang. For us the color was the thing, though. If we hadn't played out the actual consequences of these commands coming from high up, the whole thing would have started and ended in the bridges of the two flagships. <br/><br/>On the other hand, these zoom-ins were also the expression of the results of the Raises and Sees so the way they played out did have a bearing on the larger conflict. In that respect they were kind of an extended narration of each Raise and See, handled in a different scene only because of the sheer scale of the Conflict. <br/><br/>For example, during one such cutscene the Jedi assault force that Leverier sent for the Checkmate, Darth Priat's flagship, was intercepted by the Vengeance, Darth Cedess' ship. Jedi Calena Hallack made the call to give up the Checkmate and board the Vengeance instead. This was a direct result of Darth Cedess' See (intercepting the Jedi), but Calena's decision also had wider repercussions on the Conflict at large because it blinded Darth Priat to Leverier's real line of attack: A couple of technical genius Jedi who snuck on board the Checkmate and eventually reprogrammed its computers to take over the ship. <br/><br/>Heh, I'd be interested in seeing what would happen with Band of Brothers or Starship Troopers, too. I think completely rule-less freeplay like we did in the cutscenes might be less than satisfying for that kind of more battle-oriented drama. Wushu might be a good rule to use for the zoom-ins, since it's so quick and light, but could be a little too cinematic for something as gritty as Band of Brothers. At any rate, adding some kind of rule to the cutscenes seems like a good idea for a more battle-focused IP, and good stakes-setting should steer people away from the trap of fixing results to fit the Raise or See.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
