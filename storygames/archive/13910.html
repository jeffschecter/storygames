Hey, what can I say, I'm backed up on awesome little play moments!<br/><br/><b>Westchesterville (80s new Mutants using Smallville):</b><br/><br/>Manuel de la Rocha--Empath of the White Queen's Hellions--sneaks onto the Xavier School grounds to cause trouble, revenge for his humiliation in the two teams' last battle. He comes upon good-hearted but awkward Sam Guthrie (Cannonball) training in the Danger Room with Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler), while repressed, guilt-ridden Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane) looks on. Unseen, Empath magnifies Rahne's attraction and admiration of Sam to unnatural levels. She's overcome and rushes to him after his gymnastics exercise, exclaiming "Oh Sam, you were magnificent!" She throws herself into Sam's arms and gives him a victory kiss, which becomes a frenzy of kisses and caresses as her animal desire runs wild.<br/><br/>Kurt, feeling a little nudge from Empath as well, thinks to himself that he's glad Rahne is loosening up and admitting her feelings, and steps out to give the kids some privacy. Sam, meanwhile, frantically tries to fight Rahne off, as she continues her affections and answers his protests with encouragement to let himself go and deny their love no longer! finally Sam puts his foot down and shoves her away, exclaiming: "Darn it Rahne, ah don't wanna do that with you!"<br/><br/>Rahne stands in shock as the words sink in. Then with a rush of shame and horror at what she's done, she flees the Danger Room in tears, transforming to wolf and dashing out to the Westchester woods to escape her humiliation, while Sam stands there helpless and confused.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pitch-perfect Claremont teen anguish!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315229/#Comment_315229" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-02T23:17:14+00:00" title="March  2, 2011 11:17PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played another game of Microscope yesterday, and it was great!<br/>It was about the Spanish conquering South America, until they faced the Mapuche who actually could fight back.

Maybe someday.<br/><br/>Anyway, last night my crew tried out <a href="http://yarukizero.wordpress.com/2011/02/23/magical-burst-first-draft/" rel="nofollow">Magical Burst</a>, Ewen Cluney's game of dysfunctional magical girls.  The PCs consisted of:<br/><br/>Knight Eternal, who controls fear and is being anonymously blackmailed about her monster-fighting,<br/>Eternal Star, an idol singer with magical music and a key-shaped sword,<br/>Nurse Witch, a lightning-slinger with a terminal illness, <br/>and her semi-estranged sister Princess Witch, a yankee/delinquent with a heart of gold and powers over Nothingness.<br/><br/>The girls all shared the same familiar, a three-eared cat they referred to as "Meowgician" because its true name had too many apostrophes and caused birds to tumble out of the sky dead when spoken aloud.<br/><br/>Overcharge and Fallout were the story-driving killer app; the game started with the Nurse Witch scuffling with a Buddhist monk trying to exorcise the demonic influence hanging over her, which drove her so berserk she scourged him unconscious/dead with lightning bolts, leading to her trying to do the same to her sister's boyfriend, escalating to a face-off between sisters.  The Princess Witch won out, but passed out from the emotional stress.  Meanwhile, a classmate saw Knight Eternal  using her powers, and, mad with the need to preserve her secret, Knight used her fear powers to convince the witness to commit suicide, opposed by Star's soothing magical voice. She returned the girl's psyche to balance before she harmed herself, but things went even further awry because Knight gained six Overcharge on that roll and her powers went wild, creating a horrific Magic Burst we treated as a localized fracture in reality gushing forth hordes of shadowy youma.  All the magical girls dodged harm, but the priest was torn to bloody ribbons, and the unlucky boyfriend's soul was annihilated and his empty husk made home by demons.  Compounding this awfulness, Star had also gained a ridiculous amount of Overcharge during the last exchange and acted out by impulsively planting a kiss on the rescued classmate, repulsing and confusing her so much that a youma possessed her too.  That led to ANOTHER Overcharged fight between magical girls, which ended in Star saving the innocent girl's life from her bloodthirsty teammates, but at the cost of her body being permanently warped by the huge magical energies she'd called on.  And all during the fighting, their "familiar" watched quietly nearby, tail swishing happily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315867/#Comment_315867" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T10:16:16+00:00" title="March  8, 2011 10:16AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We finished an Apocalypse World game by building a machine that fixed the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315871/#Comment_315871" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T10:34:05+00:00" title="March  8, 2011 10:34AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had a mini-convention this weekend.

They want to know what she knows about the subliminals Phoenix Down mafiosos have been splicing into skins (sensory recordings). Lola doesn't like getting pushy emails from strangers (particularly when she's the tech who was putting in the subs), so she flips it on them, backtraces their internets and then broadcasts their secret hideout all across the net. Veritas has many enemies, including the cops, and they swoop in and bust heads. Score 1 for hacker Lola, 0 for smug whistleblowers. This was a face-off scene that the antagonist thought was going somewhere else, but the player running Lola went atomic when pressured. Nice.<br/><br/>In a later scene, Lola is sipping 'spro at her favorite hipster cafe, expecting accolades from all her scenester friends for her virtual victory, but instead she's getting the stink-eye from a lot of her peers. An angry confrontation ensues. "What the hell Lola? We thought you were with us, not The Man." Turns out a bunch of her friends are secretly Veritas, young idealists working the streets to put out their digital zine and expose corruption endemic in the system. Lola just got a bunch of them busted. Oops. This was another face-off, but instead of a literal attack, the goal is just to make Lola feel guilty and lose some Willing. Lola tries to arrogant-up and call them amateurs. Dice crush Lola, and she meekly offers to help undo the damage anyway she can. So much for the hotshot hacker.<br/><br/>So far the Light hack is working much better for us than our previous Remember Tomorrow games.

He led his people to freedom and overthrew the government, but when we zoom in to see how his fledgling nation gets along with its neighbors (who want peace but also want to keep their slaves) we find he's enjoying his new power too much to risk it. He'd rather secretly make peace and remain safely on his new throne rather than march off to liberate the neighboring slaves, much to the disgust of his old comrades-in-arms. He fires up the mobs with promises of liberating crusades, but secretly prepares a diplomatic visit to make nice to the wealthy neighboring rulers.<br/><br/>He's no Spartacus. But the history already says that, later on, cascading slave revolts sweep through the colonies. If Kartan is pursuing profitable peace instead of further rebellion, how does that happen?<br/><br/>We play a scene of the diplomatic visit, with Kartan's unctuous advisor touring the slave farms with his wealthy host. The advisor was a former slave, liberated in Kartan's revolt just a few weeks ago, but now he's dressed in the finery of his former masters, hob-nobbing with the nobles, and looking down on the other slaves. The slave-turned-aristocrat even chides his host when a slave's outbursts go unpunished. "In my country, such behavior would never be tolerated from a slave..." Says the former slave, with zero sympathy and twisted irony. Wonderfully despicable.<br/><br/>But when the lusty advisor tries to take a beautiful young slave girl out of the fields "for finer things\u2026" her father is driven to a fury. He impales an overseer with his pitchfork, the other slaves seize their chance, and before you know it, Kartan's visit sparks the rebellion after all...

The Clinic Compaix\xe3o in Rio needed its cancer therapy meds, but they were held at the port by a corrupt BOPE official looking to score points with a local drug lord.

It was AMAZING. I wish more people would run my game for me, I had so much fun. We played with his girlfriend Laura, who is awesome, and also Vincent who is okay if you're into that sort of thing.<br/><br/>I was playing a civilian, Jenna, who was completely oblivious to everything except that she really dug the bookish dude, Wade, who let her play spy sometimes. Wade was hyper-aware of everything except my character's general incompetence and feelings for him. Laura's no-nonsense commando was freaking awesome, too.<br/><br/>My character's roommate, Damian, was really into her\u2014 and oblivious, she never noticed, and kept ditching him to hang out with Wade, or inviting Wade along when they were going to do things together. Wade was staying at this super sketchy La Quinta in Somerville, MA. Anyway. Jenna's about to slip out to go to the big heist, and Damian stops her. "Where are you going?! What is this shit that Wade has gotten you into? You're going to get yourself killed? You're going to get ME killed! Dudes followed me home from work last night! This is not cool, and you're not leaving until you tell me where you're going!"<br/><br/>I barely make my Provocateur roll and manage to convince him I'm not going to a heist. "Look, Wade's taking me to The Melting Pot, okay? I didn't want to tell you because I know how you feel about non-local chain restaurants and I knew you'd be all judgy but WADE IS TAKING ME SOMEWHERE NICE AND I DON'T CARE."<br/><br/>This causes enough stress to break my relationship with Damian. He shouts "Oh REALLY! I'm getting FUCKING TAILED because WADE IS TAKING YOU TO THE MELTING POT. Fine! Fine. I don't care WHAT happens to you at the La Quinta."<br/><br/>After the heist, during Blowback, I make Wade promise we can move in together, to a real apartment.

He goes to retrieve some weird tech she had, and asks if there's anything of note in there. So I say, "well her skull's split open and there's some weird looking coppery wires all through the grey matter" The brainer's player says "I take a closer look" and motions grabbing a strand and pulling... <br/><br/>Also, Pinkie the chopper's attempt to take over the whole damn area the game is set in came to a bloody, crashing halt when he messed with Lavender the maestro'd. Turns out that starting a war in front of her bar is a really bad idea: there were no survivors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318038/#Comment_318038" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T02:09:17+00:00" title="March 29, 2011  2:09AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Free Market @ Game Storm. Hans, Aspen (sp?) and me playing, Mike Sugarbaker as the superuser<br/><br/>Our MRCZ: ReDuvai, bringing back the authentic lifeforms of Old Earth (or a reasonable facsimile), now in convenient pocket-sizes! "Yes, the giraffabat is an authentic Earth species. Yes, we're positive. The wings just make the long neck even more effective. Well in that case can I interest you in one of Earth's fierce nocturnal predators, the glorilla?"<br/><br/>We had a fantastic time, but I'm not sure the rules really spun us up so much as the starting setting and then bouncing off each others' creativity. We did have one magic mechanical moment, with Boomhauser, the politest assassin ever (played with uber-professionalism by Mike) clearing the air with Aspen's character before whacking him to avoid Frownies and Flow problems, and Aspen trying to talk him out of it. Aspen was horribly outgunned, but using every trick in the book he got a huge edge and should have won, but then lost disastrously anyway, entertaining the hell out of all of us at the table. Hans and I, tremendously impressed by the hitman's poise and professionalism, both friended him as he politely marched our partner to the airlock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
