It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s small, white, and friendly to hold.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m conflicted on the lack of title on the front of the book, but I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really care that much.  It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s an elegant object.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, imagine my distress when I discovered that a drop of coffee had somehow worked its way through the top of my satchel and left a brown spot right in the middle of the front of the book.  Argh!I guess that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll just call it battle damage.  So now, my <i>Bliss Stage</i> book has one point of Trauma.  I wonder how a book gets Trauma relief?<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, we finished our <i>Bliss Stage</i> campaign.  It was good and bad and difficult and thought-provoking, and everyone got what they wanted, except maybe me, but that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s probably a good thing, and anyways I learned about myself because I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get what I wanted, so that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s good, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo suit up, strap in, and prepare for launch!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Pods of Darkness</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to keep the pressure on, so I started us with a briefing action.  Jared summons Marcus and tells him to go track down those alien growth pods and destroy them.  Jared is really not doing well at this point.  He is tired and strung out, and he is slowly losing control of everything.  But Marcus goes anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Mission Brief</i><br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6begin briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Pods of Darkness</i><br/>\nLocate alien growth pods (must be done first)<br/>\nIf failed, remaining goals fail<br/>\nEstablish psychic shield<br/>\nThis is a secret goal<br/>\nDestroy alien growth pods<br/>\nIf succeeded and no psychic shield, one character is harmed.<br/>\nDestroy alien growth pods<br/>\nIf succeeded and no psychic shield, one character is harmed.<br/>\nEvade alien patrol<br/>\nIf failed, wild card goal.  Pilot must improvise something.<br/>\nThis is a secret goal<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mission was largely uneventful, except for the moment where Marcus was lost to anchor contact while trying to hack together a psychic shield out of his power mace.  I did invoke Panic during his attempt to evade the alien patrol, which finally worked out for me.  In the past, when I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve invoked Panic, the player has rolled minimal neutral results, which means that Panic has actually helped out the player.  This time, not so much.  But still, Marcus burst from hiding and flattened the alien attacker.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the end of the mission, Marcus was only a couple points away from Blissing out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>A Change at the Top</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the mission, Marcus went looking for Jared to express some concerns with how things were being run.  He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s feeling like the group is taking too many risks.  Instead, Jared completely comes apart on him, sobbing that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s all too hard.  Marcus tries to encourage him, but Jared just walks off.  Marcus sighs and slumps into Jared\xe2\u20ac\u2122s chair.  Trauma Relief.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re not always subtle with our symbolism.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when Jude came in to find Jared, he found Marcus instead.  Jude and Marcus talk about the future.  Jude and Leah want to leave.  They don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t think that the city is a good place to try to raise a family.  Instead, they want to find a safer place to be.  Maybe raise horses.  At first, Marcus isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really sure if it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a good idea, but eventually he tells Jude that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s his decision.  \xe2\u20ac\u0153It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s your family, not mine.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  Jude leaves, but Jared overheard it all.  Trust Breaking with Jared, but Trust Building with Jude.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat broke Marcus\xe2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Jared, forcing him to Bliss Out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Gabrielle narrated the resolution action with Marcus.  Jared comes storming back into the room and accuses Marcus of usurping his position and stuff like that.  Marcus finally confronts Jared about how he is being a bad leader.  Instead of listening, Jared cusses out Marcus and dashes from the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcus became the new authority figure.  So Gabrielle became the new GM, and she was able to resolve our Hope.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Yes, we can establish a stable community\xe2\u20ac\xa6somewhere else.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nSo Marcus grabbed Jude and said, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s have a group meeting to discuss leaving.  Round up everyone.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Jude said, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Yes, sir\xe2\u20ac\x9d and did it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97200/#Comment_97200" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T11:32:42+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 11:32AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Infiltrators</b><br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was not yet time for peace.  Marcus came to see Jude the next day.  They had spotted incoming aliens, and he needed Jude out in an ANIMa.  So Jude launched.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause Gabrielle was now the GM, I received ownership of Leah, her anchor.  So, for the first time, I was able to anchor a mission.  Yay!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Mission Brief</i><br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6begin briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Infiltrators</i><br/>\nDestroy alien brain probe<br/>\nMust be done first<br/>\nIf failed, Kay blisses out<br/>\nLocate other probes<br/>\nIf successful, destroy other probes<br/>\nRepair destroyed sensor package<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nThe aliens were playing for keeps.  They had sent probes to kill the children as retaliation for the raid on the alien growth pods.  So Jude ran around, destroying probes.  During the fight, Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s electro-chain was ripped off his ANIMa.  (That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s his relationship with Jude.)  So, to replace it, Jude manifested his relationship with Marcus as a strong arm that fired expanding balls of laser from its palm.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, we know our symbolism.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then Marcus spoke into the mike.  He needed Jude to go north and repair the sensor package that had been disabled in the assault.  So Jude headed north and was able to repair the sensors.  But alien slime climbed up his arm, melting it away.  So Jude started yelling, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Eject!  Eject!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nJude had Blissed Out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Our Happy Home</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThat was the end for Jude.  He and Leah packed up their few belongings and headed north.  They were gone for a year, but they found a place to live near Rockford.  There was an old campground, fairly secure and beautiful.  So then, they returned to Peoria to gather the rest of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they left Peoria.<br/>\n<br/>\nJared was already gone.  He had vanished one day, abandoning Eve and Hope.  So now, Eve is a single mother, but the community is helping her with her daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth gave birth to a boy.  Leah has given birth to a little girl, and Jude is just ga-ga over her.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph refused to let the Bigelow Boys benefit from their hard work, so he set fires in the base.  Flames licked the sky as they began their exodus to the north.  Looking back, one of them saw an alien remote, striding through the ruins, highlighted by the burning city.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now they are safe.  They are careful to stay off the grid so that the aliens can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t locate them.  And yeah, all they are doing is growing herbs and raising horses.  But they are also teaching their children how to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one day, they will finish what their parents started.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Post-Game Reflections</b><br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, just to get this out of the way:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><i>Ben!  I played a girl!  Are you happy now!!!?!?!??111eleventyone</i></b><br/>\n<br/>\nActually, the most awkward part of the experience was actually trying to step into a character that had been characterized by someone else for so long.  Had I been doing so from the beginning, it might not have been so odd.<br/>\n<br/>\nGabrielle noted that, in the end, our group raised horses and grew gardens.  It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s such a girly ending.  She pities me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t realize that we could end the game whenever we wanted after we were done to one remaining pilot.  In some ways, the ending would have been more powerful if it had come immediately on the heels of Marcus taking over as leader.  But, the last mission gave him an opportunity to demonstrate his superior leadership skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for the biggest item of discussion:  the ending.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first, I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t like the ending.  It felt\xe2\u20ac\xa6weak, somehow.  I kept wanting there to be something else to make it satisfying to me, and it wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ended up having a serious discussion about it.  In my mind, the group had taken the cowards\xe2\u20ac\u2122 route.  They ran, when they should have fought.  In the end, the ground that had been fought for was lost.  They should have stayed.  Even if they had lost, it would have been a noble end.<br/>\n<br/>\nGabrielle and Crystal argued the other way.  What else was the group supposed to do?  They were out of pilots, and they were slowly losing.  Plus, they couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t keep out the Bigelow Boys forever.  They said that I needed to think multi-generationally about this.  The group hasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t given up the fight.  But they needed to withdraw for a while, regroup, and train their children to be better warriors than they had been able to be.  And what good is a noble end if the aliens win?  Crystal put it most forcefully:  if they had stayed, would they have been fighting for victory, or just for their pride?<br/>\n<br/>\nMade me think, it did.  And in the end, I think that Crystal and Gabrielle are right.  But, at the same time, it feels a lot like behavior that I do not like in others.  Rather than being willing to take on serious issues, people hide away.  At the same time, sometimes what looks like hiding is really just a temporary withdrawal, until a true victory can be won.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a major point for me, and it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s something that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be mulling over for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Conclusion</b><br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph says it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s time to go.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve already been broadcasting too long, and he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s concerned that the aliens will be able to triangulate our position.  Time to bug out and work our way towards home.  So, for the Peoria Resistance Group, this is Seth Ben-Ezra.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you on the other side.<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end transmission\xe2\u20ac\xa6                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
