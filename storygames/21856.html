That sounds exactly as if trad game design hadn't budged an inch in 30 years - something like that could well have come from TSR in the early '90s, and probably did.<br/><br/>But yes, now I'm curious, too. In fact, I'm generally curious about 5th edition adventure design: if I read between the lines correctly, this <i>Dragon Heist</i> gives us what amounts to an early '80s <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> adventure, except with messy D&amp;D regalia on top. Is this perhaps a consequence of taking influence from Pathfinder adventure paths, does anybody know? Are all 5th edition adventures sort of like this, or do they also do set-piece combat dungeons like was the norm for 3rd and 4th edition adventures? What's happening in the 5th edition D&amp;D adventure design culture?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477677/#Comment_477677" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-09T15:32:30+00:00" title="November  9, 2018  3:32PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah; I've heard nothing good about this adventure either, so I'm kinda interested in hearing another perspective...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477678/#Comment_477678" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-09T17:29:07+00:00" title="November  9, 2018  5:29PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, in a bit, I'll explain why I like the adventure. First, though, I just read Justin Alexander's gripe about it and I want to critique the critique. Also, I've only read <i>Dragon Heist</i> once through and not with the depth of analysis Justin did, so he may have spotted a lot I didn't.<br/><br/>He got a lot right. There are some continuity and timeline issues and a lot of opportunities for railroading. A lot of "strange coincidences" and "perfect timing." This is no different than almost anything Wizards has put out for 5e.<br/><br/>However, there's also advice NOT to railroad the players and to let things progress organically. For example, Justin says:\n<blockquote>the \u201cDM picks the villain before the campaign starts\u201d structure is pretty heavily embedded</blockquote>\nNo, it really isn't. In fact, the book tells you that you can change your mind who the villain is at any time. With a little work, I think you can have more than one of them in play at the same time. I mean, they all have motive.<br/><br/>The reason Chris Perkins gave for having multiple villains was something like, "a single stray Reddit comment could give away who the villain is, so we thought it'd be cool to have four possible villains." Essentially, you'll be guessing even if you think you know. As far as I can tell, it had nothing to do with "rewatchability," as Justin uncharitably suggests.<br/><br/>There's a product on DM's Guild called <i>Chapter 4: Dragon Season</i> that deconstructs <i>Dragon Heist</i> and gives DM advice for running the seasonal part of it. It points out a bunch of flaws in the adventure and recommends how to work with them. So yeah, there are lots of flaws.<br/><br/>Justin says:\n<blockquote>In many ways, Dragon Heist feels like the shattered remnants of a broken development cycle. It feels as if they were aiming for something ambitious, didn\u2019t achieve it (or maybe it fell apart in playtests), and they ended up kind of cobbling together something that was at least mostly functional out of the wreckage.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure they playtested enough, actually. With four paths, maybe they only got one good independent playtest out of each one. The other three paths aren't wasted material! Those are three fleshed out villain factions that you can use to run future city adventures in Waterdeep. Same with the lairs. <br/><br/>It's ambitious nature of the module that I love, but more on that later. As a skilled DM, I also feel like I can smooth out any of the adventure's warts on the fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477679/#Comment_477679" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-09T17:48:27+00:00" title="November  9, 2018  5:48PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now why I love <i>Dragon Heist</i>.<br/><br/>It has the most amazing <b>tone</b>. It's a caper, and for once, the stakes aren't world-ending. It's fun and exciting and funny and light in many ways. It's a big city, full of wonderful and diverse people and great opportunities. There's this MacGuffin idea of ONE MILLION GOLD PIECES just sitting there, waiting for a group to take it. <i>We'll all be rich, I tell you.</i> There is a faction of swashbucklers!<br/><br/>The four villains allows you to tease your players, having different factions poking at the adventurers, but ultimately coming down to one group. The four lairs are sandboxes, waiting for a time when the party can handle it. The villains are huge and powerful. <i>Of course</i>, a group of 1st-5th level characters aren't gonna take on a very powerful (CR 13) beholder. The module throws plenty of mooks at the party instead, but also some dangerous henchmen. At the same time, it suggests an Achilles' heal for that particular boss...<br/><br/><i>Dragon Heist</i>'s starting hook wasn't any more railroady than most module hooks. In my experience, players bite on these things without any problem. I love how the book basically says, "And now, probably the group goes on some side quests. Do what you  normally do, DM."<br/><br/>I love that the PC's patron pays them with a deed to a run-down tavern. It gives the characters roots and discourages them from leaving Waterdeep. This is how you have city adventures. The neighborhood block around the PCs' tavern is fleshed out with fantastic NPCs.<br/><br/>The product is amazingly inclusive. It has a strong sidebar talking about the wondrous diversity of the people of Waterdeep, and not just "race" in the D&amp;D sense, but also gender, sexual preference, and so on. It's amazingly diversity-positive, represented in the game by a pair of gay genies, for example. <br/><br/>The art is great. I love the continuity of the three urchins appearing in different scenes throughout the book. The city comes alive in all the pictures.<br/><br/>Could <i>Dragon Heist</i> be improved. Assuredly. I think more playtesting would have smoothed out the rough edges. The <i>Dragon Season</i> supplement I mentioned above talks about how the module completely goes in the wrong direction for a rooftop chase in winter:\n<blockquote>With advantage against complications, continuous Dash<br/>actions, 66 hit points, and a blizzard limiting visibility,<br/>Vevette has all the tools she needs to get away. However, this<br/>might result in her getting away a bit too soon, in which case<br/>the campaign book suggests that the party can ask people<br/>along the way. It seems more logical that the party can find <br/>their way to the theater by following her footprints in the<br/>snow on the rooftops. </blockquote>\nRight? But that is so easily solved at the table. Players: "Did she leave a trail of footprints?" DM: "Oh, of course, yes. Jumping from roof to roof." Players: "We follow those..."<br/><br/>Maybe some of the continuity or timeline issues are more problematic, but most player groups aren't going to construct a careful timeline as much as just run headlong into each problem. <br/><br/>I just think that <i>Dragon Heist</i> is going to be rip-roaringly <i>fun</i> to play. Yeah, the DM might have to smooth out some rough spots, but geez, it's worth it. <br/><br/>Did Adam Koebel start livestreaming it? I'm curious if he's having any of the same problems that Justin raises.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477682/#Comment_477682" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-09T18:21:05+00:00" title="November  9, 2018  6:21PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2018 6:23PM by Airk.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NM                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477683/#Comment_477683" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-09T19:29:37+00:00" title="November  9, 2018  7:29PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is pretty interesting. I went and read a couple of other reviews:<br/><br/>* One was glowing, and, in my opinion, entirely uncritical (it didn't even address any/many of the issues being brought up here). Seemed more like advertising than a review.<br/><br/>* The second was also quite keen on the adventure, but agreed with the criticisms we're discussing here.<br/><br/>From reading those reviews, it sounds like the "four Villain" design IS intended for "replayability" in some odd way (which makes no sense - are you really going to play the same adventure again with the same players? why?), but I like Adam's take on it as a "Schrodinger's Villain", instead. (The way the chosen villain determines the "season" of the adventure makes me think that Adam's interpretation isn't the intended one, however - for starters, knowing the season would immediately give away the "real villain", so that's not a good way to do things.)<br/><br/>My conclusion (or rather, guess) so far (after reading three reviews) is that it's a pretty old-school, railroaded and inconsistent adventure, but one with lots of fun Colour and ideas. Rewarding the PCs with a tavern is a nice touch, and the basic concept of the lost gold is cool; the details of how to make an adventure out of it sound rather forced and unhelpful, in contrast.<br/><br/>However, I can see how a creative GM with lots of time on her hands could use all this material to make more of a sandbox environment - basically, restructure the adventure to have all of these plot threads in play, and allow events to unroll according to the players' initiative. It would require some deep thought and rewriting/replanning, which makes me wonder why I wouldn't just start from scratch instead of buying a $50/200+ page book, but I could see *someone* being totally into that. (Especially someone who really likes having cool art, NPCs, and various Colour provided for them.)<br/><br/>Is that the potential you see here, Adam? Or would you run it as written?<br/><br/>There's multiple mention of clever "chase sequences" and other design features (encounter chains?) in these reviews. Are any of these exciting, from a design standpoint? If so, what makes them cool or unique?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477684/#Comment_477684" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-09T19:38:50+00:00" title="November  9, 2018  7:38PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2018 7:47PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick update:<br/><br/>Adam Koebel has been running "Dragon Heist" on "Roll20 Presents", and, apparently, his approach is to show as much of the "DM side" to the viewers as possible, including various spoilers.<br/><br/>If anyone has the time and patience to both a) read the adventure, and b) watch the series, please let us know to what extent he's running the adventure as-written as opposed to changing things on the fly to make it more palatable.<br/><br/>(I've managed to watch just the very beginning of the adventure, and it starts with the characters gathered at the Yawning Portal, which, apparently, is or contains an entrance to the Underdark, and hence gets its name.

There are like five chapters in the middle of the adventure, only one of which will be useful to a given run-through of the adventure, based on which Giant lord the players decide to take on. It's like they're *trying* to make a nonlinear sandbox (which is appreciated), but the only way they know how to build one is with linear-adventure tools.<br/><br/>Dragon Heist smells similar.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that D&amp;D podcasters and streamers are starting to show up in the credits of these books (James Introcaso, Matt Mercer). You'd expect if they wanted to actually make nonlinear adventures they'd work with OSR people. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477686/#Comment_477686" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-09T20:09:43+00:00" title="November  9, 2018  8:09PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Of course, immediately, one of the players says, "Ok, straight into the dungeon I go!", and then the group has to laugh and heckle a bit, and then explain that's not the right adventure, and that option isn't on the table.

I don't see a single group replaying it, but if you'd played in the Xanathar season before, you could play with a different group and replay it, and just warn your DM you'd played that part before. Or a DM could replay it with a different season and a different group and feel like it was a different experience.<br/><br/>I think it's kind of cool that different groups will have very different play experiences, too. "Hey, did you play Dragon Heist?" "Yeah! We fought Xanathar's faction. It was fire."

It has flaws, but they're not fatal. I would play <i>Dragon Heist</i> as written, smoothing out wrinkles, as needed. <br/><br/>I don't think there would be much trouble at the table. I don't think it has to be terribly railroady. If the players want to go off and do side quests or whatever, they can. <br/><br/>Ultimately, there's the lure of a MILLION GOLD PIECES. If an adventuring party doesn't keep thinking about that, then I'd be surprised. <br/><br/>But let's say they're all altruistic types. Then there's the faction system that <i>Dragon Heist</i> puts front and center. I forgot to talk about that. It's the faction system used in Adventurer's League games and it got a reprise in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, but it gets a full treatment here, too. In <i>Dragon Heist,</i> PCs bump into the agents of all kinds of factions, good and evil, and all of them have agendas. Most of them want the MacGuffin or the 1,000,000 gold pieces, obviously. They'll hire or bribe or coerce the characters into helping them get it.<br/><br/>Once the PCs have it in their heads that they need to be on this quest, then it's a caper. Are there Benny Hill chases? Sure. Capers have those. Are some of them stupid? Yes. (Chase a Kenku and catch him--oh no, he threw the MacGuffin to the next Kenku, and now you have to chase that one!) But those are easily fixed.<br/><br/>Should <i>Dragon Heist</i> be better? Yeah, sure. But it's still amazing for all the reasons I listed. It's not so flawed that people aren't going to have a blast with it at their tables, as is, out of the book.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477689/#Comment_477689" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-09T21:06:06+00:00" title="November  9, 2018  9:06PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think it's kind of cool that different groups will have very different play experiences, too.

I recommend picking it up, if you want a long list of flaws in <i>Dragon Heist</i> and how to solve them pretty easily.<br/><br/>Some of the villains are inherently evil and some are not. That changes a lot. Their motivations are different and when/if the PCs find out what drives a "villain," they might change their minds about what to do. One of the villains has a good chance of befriending the party before they find out they're the antagonist. That changes things, no?<br/><br/>The encounter chains are different. They use the same set piece locations (or really, each uses 8 of the 10 locations in a different order), but the foes they meet at each one are different. Spring has 5 combats and 1 more with a risk of combat, and only 1 chase (on the street). Winter has 3 combats, 2 more with a risk of combat, a street chase and a rooftop chase.<br/><br/>The different villain encounters have totally different combat encounters.  Summer: cult fanatics and devils and some other things I don't want to spoil.  Fall: goblins, a half-ogre, duergar, troglodytes, a gibbering mouther, drow...<br/><br/>Are the chases railroads? That depends on what you think happens if the villains get away. If the bad guy thugs successfully escape, then they take the Stone of Golarr to the villain's lair. Oh, hey, I guess there's a reason those lairs are in the book after all!<br/><br/>The argument can be made (and IS made by <i>Dragon Season</i>) that some of the seasons are way better than the others. For example, they think Xanathar's season is a bit lackluster and Fall has some logical inconsistencies.<br/><br/>But to say that <i>very little changes</i>? So wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477693/#Comment_477693" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-10T06:32:45+00:00" title="November 10, 2018  6:32AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2018 6:38AM by Paul_T.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, Adam. That certainly makes it sound more appealing.<br/><br/>I found an episode of "Dragon Talk" on YouTube, where Chris Perkins and Matt Mercer talk about designing and writing <i>Dragon Heist</i>.<br/><br/>It's quite fascinating:<br/><br/>* First of all, yes, the idea to include four possible villains was very explicitly thought up as a strategy to avoid people on Twitter or Reddit or whatever giving away the mystery, spoiling it for other players.<br/><br/>It came out of the question of, "How can we publish a mystery adventure, and not have it spoiled immediately?"<br/><br/>(You're probably right that associating seasons with villains is just too obscure to worry about.)<br/><br/>* They playtested the adventure with about 200 groups, and the feedback had all kinds of funny and oddball outcomes (e.g. a group becoming completely obsessed with a shop barely mentioned in a few lines of the adventure, and that becoming the main focus of the campaign, to the exclusion of the actual "plot"). They see that as a feature, not a bug, however. ("Working as intended.")<br/><br/>In the process, they would also locate stumbling points (like an encounter killing one or more PCs or being too difficult) and "fix" them.<br/><br/>* Chris Perkins speaks about how he started writing adventures by imitating, as closely as possible, adventures he saw written for 1st Edition D&amp;D. He continues to say that this is, basically, what he is still doing today, just with better presentation. (This makes me think think of some of Eero's comments, upthread, about this style of adventure design...)<br/><br/>* They speak a bit about how the style of D&amp;D has changed over time: that in the 80s, there was a lot of "walk into a room, kill all the monsters there, repeat", but in modern D&amp;D there is much more of a sense of story and narrative, which the players get to experience. (The way they speak about this sounds very much like the "middle school" D&amp;D approach we've been discussing here on Story Games, especially 2nd Ed. AD&amp;D and adventure writing from the 90s.) <br/><br/>They speak of the narrative heights of the game now as a major achievement, and something they're very proud of.<br/><br/>* Interestingly, the GMs discuss how they carefully plot out events and make contingency plans for if the players do this or that or this other thing... but they also say that, despite the prep, the most exciting and creative and fun play is when the players come up with something the GM hasn't thought of and isn't prepared for, and has to improvise, instead. <br/><br/>(Although the logical consideration or question - "why not play that way all the time?" - never rears its head in their discussions. There is very much the assumption, it seems to me, that the GM's job is to limit possibilities for the PCS, and then prepare for every possible outcome, and the more ground you cover, the better a job you're doing. However, when that fails, really fun play results, but <i>we must not consciously seek that fun</i>. Fairly typical RPG thinking from 25+ years ago, I would say - as I have discussed more than a bit in our <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21370/critical-role-and-the-rise-of-d-d" rel="nofollow">earlier thread on Critical Role</a>.)<br/><br/>* I love the evident passion for the project and the amount of work put into it, from everyone involved. I find the sort of geek/nerd obsession with spending months establishing background details (in this case, about the history of the city and its factions) quite fascinating; almost Tolkienesque. <br/><br/>(Although it also shows a remarkable lack of awareness of what is useful or practical in gaming and what is just world-building out of habit - to me, another "typical" trait of dated RPG thinking that I was happy to leave behind long ago.)<br/><br/>I'd love to hear about my earlier questions:<br/><br/>Are the ways the chase sequences and encounter chains are set up clever, groundbreaking, ingenious? Is there some cool game design tech there that's worth checking out? What are they like? Several reviews hint at them, but don't give away much more than that. <br/><br/>Is the cleverness of the encounter chains simply in that they recycle the same locations, for instance? Or is there more to it than that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477694/#Comment_477694" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-10T06:52:29+00:00" title="November 10, 2018  6:52AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Sidenote: I have no idea whether this is 100% applicable to this thread, but it reminded me of a discussion Sandra and I had about using linear modules for non-linear play a while back:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/471681" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/471681</a><br/><br/>I'd almost forgotten about that discussion.

All purchased adventures require some kind of wink-and-nod for the players to at least take the opening hook, right? <br/><br/>The fun is in the caper stuff: wild combats and chase scenes, fun role-playing encounters with memorable characters, and a hell of a backstory to discover.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477709/#Comment_477709" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-11T14:11:14+00:00" title="November 11, 2018  2:11PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for elaborating on this, Adam, particularly given the difficult context (Here's a negative review.

I don't see fantasy fiction heroes tend to haggle so much for their price to go on righteous adventures...).<br/><br/>* It seems to play as a sequence of scenes and events that the players are supposed to follow. I didn't see any railroading (because the players didn't try to "stray off the path"), but it does seem fairly linear.<br/><br/>* The level of detail and care put into those details is very apparent. Adam even uses a version of the adventure set up specifically for online play, which includes digital versions of all the maps, stats, handouts, and so on. The characters on the map use "dynamic lighting" to reveal parts of the map as they move around (something I first saw in Adam_Dray's D&amp;D game!). Impressive!

Much apprec!<br/><br/>Yes, I applied those techniques successfully to a linear adventure, Corsairs of the Great Sea, it was awesome. Extracting locations and NPCs and translating events to "the NPCs really want to do this if they can". And moving "world" events to random dice rolls.<br/><br/>Man, I had Dragon Heist in my hands and flubbed reading it more carefully!<br/><br/>I was working on new chase rules and I heard Dragon Heist was gonna have new chase rules (it doesn't really) so I borrowed it and I only glanced at <b>that</b> part.<br/>Overall we were really hyped for it but my quick glances made it look way more, uh... scripty? than I was comfortable with. Our group already had some problems with the triggers in the Carrowmore part of Deep Carbon Observatory; the events in Carrowmore are triggered by the player's choices but it's so seamless and immediate that it felt to them railroady and pushed. [BTW I love my players for giving me constant feedback. And for other things. Just love them. (We currently have five players + some that want to get in on the game but I have been hesitant to expand the group more.)]<br/><br/>By comparison I thought the Omu part of Tomb of Annihilation was freaking awesome. There, too, the players wondered if it was scripted but\u2026 in Omu there are mechanics for the opposing faction progress. A simple quick die roll each diegetic day to see which of the maguffins the opposing faction had gotten their hands on or not. Made the city feel <i>super</i> alive.<br/><br/>My first glances at DH kinda scared me off it and I felt embarrassed for being so hyped up for it and all my players got hyped up too. RN the plan for next campaign, if Tomb of Annihilation ever finishes (we're over fifty sessions in at this point but we have so much left to do) is gonna be Ravnica and put it more on the Hillfolky side of the spectrum. (If our al-Qadim campaign was the midpoint, our Tomb of A campaign is more to the side of D&amp;D, the plan is for our Ravnica campaign to be more on the side of Hillfolk.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
