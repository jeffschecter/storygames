Above the waist is fine enough too but she's crippled and walks only with the assistance of crutches and leg braces.<br/><br/>There's a new cult in the hardhold just came in.  They don't know her yet or what she can do, so maybe she's got a chance with one of them.  One prospect, Fel, is about her age and catches her eye.  She convinces him to come back to her bombed-out apartment, but only at the cost of making a new enemy, Fel's on again off again woman, Tao.  It's a price Brace is willing to pay.<br/><br/>When Brainers have sex with another character they automatically do a deep brain scan on them.  As Brace climaxes she knows two things.  1) Fel craves the forgiveness of Tao.  2) <i>His lowest moment is having sex with Brace, a decision he deeply regrets.<br/></i><br/>Her eyes tear up and she starts to say "You can leave if you want to," but she doesn't want him to know she can read him.  And it's been so long...  She tries to spoon with him and he turns away.

The party is told to stay belowdecks while the orcs bring out a bunch of tower shields and start sailing down the absolute middle of the river.  They find out they're sailing through elvish woods and it turns out the elves know the Bloody Vengeance by sight.  The night passes as hails of arrows plink the river raider and each crewman is protected by his mates and their tower shields.<br/><br/>In the wee hours of the morning, an orc cries out in pain.  The party yells for him to be drug down to them belowdecks.  His shieldmates carry him quickly down, both looking at each other accusingly.  The situation was that the orc would die and one shield mate would accuse the other of falling asleep, a fight ensues and whichever was they choose, half the crew would be on them.<br/><br/>But the PC priest was able to not only heal the orc, he made an impressive Persuasion roll.  The scene ends with three orc falling to their knees in praise of the battle god, learning a hymn in praise of her, then charging back onto the deck to continue their work singing their newly learned hymn (badly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269904/#Comment_269904" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T09:05:51+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  9:05AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World. My operator Lafferty has just killed the mistress of the Lighthouse and escaped in her cigarette boat with his gang.  All they have are the cult robes they were dressed in and one handgun with seven bullets.  Lafferty is in transition to become a Hardholder, we think, but it's not clear yet what place he's going to take over as his holding. He's just clearly gotten fed up with the way everyone else is governing the world. His impulse is to take over Prospect with his new boat, which is this seedy island full of strange wackos with rifles that nobody visits and nobody trades with, but, talking it over with the rest of his gang while floating just offshore, they rightly consider it suicide to assault the place with just robes and a single handgun.  Lafferty gives in and we head home to Silvertree instead.<br/><br/>Bondo (who Lafferty keeps calling "Brando" by accident) is driving the boat when one of these mysterious spy drones picks us out coming over the water.  We kick the boat up to 100mph and try to lose it, but the drone is totally gonna get pictures of us, so Lafferty grabs the wheel and throws the boat to the right so it crashes right up on Prospect instead, forcing everyone into the situation he wanted in the first place.  Then the crew, after some initial confusion, proceeds to go from building to building, totally taking out the fucked up cannibals (straight out of The Road, keeping people as meat in their basements) who turn out to run Prospect.  Turns into a total rout / gorefest, including a scene where Dusk and Lee massacred dozens of people with a bonesaw and then cause the remaining Prospectors to flee because they look like the gore-drenched reaver bandits that tortured them and turned them into crazy cannibals in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270002/#Comment_270002" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T22:05:18+00:00" title="May  4, 2010 10:05PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2010 10:06PM by Elizabeth.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blowback. Bridget's ex-boyfriend is in a bind, his parole officer is a dirty cop and trying to get him to blow up some construction in downtown Dublin, or get sent back to jail. Bridget promises to fix it with the help of her friends, Sergei, Sean, and Geoffrey.<br/><br/>Sergei's at this bar drinking with a super cute girl named Riley. He asks for her number and they go out again. She falls hard for him; turns out she's a spoiled rich girl and Sergei's the only man who hasn't tried to use her for her money.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sean and Geoffrey are working out the details of the plan: whether to horn in on the scam or to send the mastermind (Dan Brennan, richest man in town) to jail. Geoffrey says, "Either we can stop a terrorist plot and look good, or we can do a terrorist plot and make a ton of money. It's win-win."<br/><br/>They go for a third option: blackmail Dan to exculpate Bridget's ex, and then take Dan out to the country and shoot him because Sean accidentally said Bridget's name in front of him. Two days later, Riley calls Sergei in tears: her father's missing and they say he skipped town, but he wouldn't do that, he promised he'd never run out on her the way her mother did. Sergei takes this moment to awkwardly break up with her.<br/><br/>The team cleans up their messes with each other, and finishes a successful job: there's a manhunt for the richest man in Dublin, his henchmen are crawling the city looking for them, and the local headline is HEIRESS HOSPITALIZED AFTER SUICIDE ATTEMPT; FATHER PRESUMED DEAD.

We are doing a normal-ish Suburb game of interesting characters. My character is an 18 year-old landscaper chick who wants to be famous and leave town. We brought this into play in the first scene: It turns out that when she was sleeping on a couch on a hot day, a cat was laying on her face, so she was uncomfortable and thrashing around in her sleep but the cat remained on her face.<br/><br/>Someone took a video and uploaded it to Youtube. Cut to four days later and there have been 2,000,000 views. Somehow she's looking to turn this into money and success. A few scenes later, there's a few million more viewers and everyone is talking about it.<br/><br/>"Just think!" she tells her homeowner cop client who took the video "...if each one of those viewers were one dollar, I'd have 2 Million Dollars!"<br/><br/>Now, though, she's looking to make a sequel: She wants the cop to take a video of her and her friend sleeping with either one cat on each of their faces at the same time, or else one long cat over both of their faces.<br/><br/>She's aiming to make it big.

Not sure what to make of this yet.<br/>*I'm not sure about the replayability of the game. The way things are now, it loses a lot after the first play. But the players said they wanted to play again, so maybe I'm wrong.<br/>*I will probably have to loosen up the premise. As it is it's extremely tight and feels almost like a minigame, missing a larger context.<br/>*It needs more incentives for roleplaying, which probably means my agenda of removing all NPCs will have to be discarded...but I don't want to do that so I need something to encourage inter-player roleplay.<br/>*I have learned how to better communicate the game.<br/><br/>Oh, and another thing, they tried to hold on to their Beauty, hard. They were extremely reluctant to discard it, so maybe I'm doing something wrong there. It makes sense to keep on to your Beauty, but I wanted them to spend more of it.

The really cool thing about the game is its semi-literary quality, where you move from one passage of cheesy fantasy fiction to another, with the players making choices and taking more freeform or task resolution actions in between.  But the weird thing was that -- despite that being the whole point of the game -- we stopped doing that after a while, drifting the game to be something else that might have been still kinda fun but definitely not what the game was intended to be.  And I'm still trying to figure out how that happened.  <br/><br/>There's something strange going on when I GM games in Seattle that I haven't quite figured out yet.  I'm not sure if it's running games for new groups of folks that I haven't played with before or what, if I'm instinctively relying on the shared backgrounds and experiences and play preferences of the groups I was regularly playing with in Boston and just haven't normalized myself to the differences among players here or what.  Or maybe I don't feel like I've earned the social authority yet to really step into a true leadership role at the table. Or if I'm expecting a certain kind of engagement from the players that's not coming as naturally as I expect.  Or if I'm not presenting the task at hand, how we're going to play this particular game, sufficiently.  In any event, there's been this weird disconnect at least 3-4 times now, way more than I remember happening in Boston, and it's really frustrating, because it's clearly something I'm doing or not doing as a GM, since I never really have this problem as a player.  It's like my GMing instincts and player-reading abilities are all somewhat off and end up taking the game in directions neither I nor the players want.<br/><br/>Definitely want to try this game again sometime, but, man, it really does take the wind out of your sails when something is mediocre and you're not quite sure how you let it get to that point, when it's clearly some social issue and not anything to do with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273127/#Comment_273127" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T09:12:34+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  9:12AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            we played XXXXtreme STREET luge at last Saturday's GoPlay PDX.<br/><br/>Maxim Scorsese, a 17 year-old luger, was just too fucking hard to care about that semi that crossed the course--he didn't slow down or anything.

And what right did his boss have to live over these people? And that's all it took to put the gun in Mordecai's hands, the bullets in his coworkers' heads.<br/><br/>I started the second session with a bit of dilemma. Where the fuck do you go next, after you kill everyone you work with and pass it off as a gypsy attack? Well, it turns out that you spend some time dwelling in a weird microfame that all the gossip and suspicion manufactures for you. And then you have a gorgeous noblewoman show up at your door late at night, wanting a taste of your dirty, forbidden action.<br/><br/>And it turns out that you dress her up like a poor man, and sneak her into a drinking hall, and get her wasted out of her mind.
