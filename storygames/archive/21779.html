Forest everywhere. Inflorenza is the game to live in hell, to fight for your soul and to die of love.<br/><br/>"London Girls" is a theater from the Inflorenza book. It has been writen by Eugénie.<br/>Contemporary London, in a world where the premises of Milesvale appear, for a British romcom in the likes of Bridget Jones<br/><br/>We try to show all the respect we have for the protagonists of this theater. But as Côme and I are boys and not girls and as this is roleplay (fictionial and partly improvisated), we may have made some mistakes and misinterpretations, so please tell us in the comments.<br/><br/>Côme (english translator of Inflorenza) plays Karen, a former corporate/advertiser who now studies classic litteracy and fell in love with her teacher.<br/>Isabelle plays Tascha, a fashion designer who tries to rebuild herself after being separated from her mate. <br/>I (author of the french version of Inflorenza) play Dina, a curvy woman who is a youtube star and fashion egery <br/><br/>Côme and Isabelle are french but their english is fluently. Mine is unfortunately far from perfect, i thank you for you leniency <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This actual play is in public domain.<br/> </div>
