Some players seem afflicted with it... its part and parcel to the "empty chair syndrome" where a player seems to be enjoying things, and comes back week after week, but usually just ends up sitting there, and sometimes reacting to things.  "Oh my god... what do I say?"<br/>\n<br/>\nRelated to writer's block too, I think... the big intimidating blank page.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith story-heavy games where people are expected to provide a good deal of input and collaboration, it can be a game-killer.  A player can feel put on the spot, judged, and ineffectual, and that sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond gentle encouragement, trust-building, and all that feel-good crap, anyone have any good techniques for lighting a creative fire under the asses of paralyzed players?<br/>\n<br/>\n-B                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J.%20Scott%20Timmerman" title="J.

Tell me to frame a scene, and I've got no fucking idea what (if anything) I can come up with that will lead somewhere worthwhile.  Tell me to frame a scene where John and Mitch reminisce and show off how they're buddies, and now we're getting somewhere, but I might still need a moment or two to come up with halfway decent material for it.  But if you tell me to frame that same scene on the night before Mitch is getting married, and by the way, John's been sleeping with Mitch's sister for a month, now all kinds of ideas are going to be rolling into my head right away, and I can jump right in.<br/><br/>Other good limitations under certain circumstances include the numbered list (pick one or however many from the list) and setting/character/motivation limitations ("every character was born in the same small town," "everyone is a small business owner who wants to keep Wal-Mart out of the county").<br/><br/>Basically, anything that takes the big, unfocused "PRODUCE SOMETHING GALACTICALLY AWESOME IMMEDIATELY OR DIE" spotlight and turns it into a tighter, brighter "Do something awesome in this friendly sandbox with this collection of fun toys" helps with spotlight paralysis.  Of course, at some point <i>somebody</i> has to come up with the limitations, so if everyone's got the same problem you're probably just screwed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110115/#Comment_110115" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T13:55:19+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  1:55PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've taken it, probably incorrectly, that the player simply doesn't care about what's happening in the scene when this happens.

Isn't the setup (John and Mitch reminisce and show off how they're buddies) basically the frame?

If, when we set up to play, everyone makes a character with an interest connected to the situation (and at odds with at least one other character, probably), then the wide open "WHAT DO YOU DO?" is a non-question. <i>What</i> to do isn't the issue anymore. You pursue your interest, and in doing so, you cross somebody else or you hit an obstacle that makes your interest hard to get or whatever. The question is, <i>how</i> do you go about pursuing your interest, and how do you deal with adversity?<br/><br/>You're moving before play starts. A character with a rocking good agenda should make you <i>desperate</i> to play, to put their plans into motion and drive toward their goals. Not feeling that? Maybe you need a new character and/or situation.<br/><br/>When I see empty chair syndrome, it's usually from a player who is interested almost exclusively in <i>who the character is</i> and not what the character wants to achieve, in this situation, right here and now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110126/#Comment_110126" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T14:30:58+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  2:30PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2007 2:31PM by John_Harper.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Systems that let you make the exact dream character you want can reinforce the empty chair, too.

The player wants to play an upstanding knight of the realm whose bravery is unparalleled? Okay. Ask them to start out as a bitter, drunken veteran of a pointless war, too shattered by the horrors he's seen to even pick up a sword.<br/><br/>Then, if they want to come around to the brave knight, they have to <i>play</i> their way to it. They have a goal to pursue, and an unacceptable situation to leave behind. I bet the blank look of the empty-chair* fades pretty fast.<br/><br/><br/>* Assuming they'll play at all, of course.

Lots of people find that their creativity improves when they work within boundaries.  If you've got players like that, then tightening up the boundaries can be a good strategy.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I used really painfully awkward phrasing, and it makes it sound like I'm talking about being able to frame a scene as the goal.  Framing a scene is <i>not</i> the goal, it's just a tool to get a scene going and keep the people playing in it on track and having fun.<br/><br/>So if the spotlight paralysis that really worries you is the way someone stares awkwardly at their shoes for a minute when you ask them to frame a scene, then, yeah, I guess I'm saying someone else should go ahead and frame that scene for them.  Why not?  It's not like framing the scene is the fun part, after all: as long as the scene itself rocks and the people in it are jazzed about playing in it, no one should give a crap who gave them the frame.  If, on the other hand, you get worried about whether the people in the scene are sufficiently jazzed, tightening up the frame might be the thing that reduces the pressure and lets them really cut loose.<br/><br/>(Hopefully that's a little bit clearer.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110131/#Comment_110131" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T14:41:17+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  2:41PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

I guess it comes down to where you think people "really contribute" to the game, and whether you really want or need everyone to contribute evenly to all areas of the game.<br/><br/>Personally, if I was playing with someone who couldn't (or didn't want to) fill in certain blanks on their own, but who could take what someone else gave them and knock the resulting scenes out of the park, I certainly wouldn't say that person wasn't really contributing to the game.  Far from it!  (And if the rules of the game required that every player must take turns filling in those blanks, that would be one of the first rules that I'd consider crossing out with a thick black marker.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110144/#Comment_110144" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T15:18:13+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  3:18PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2007 3:18PM by Max Higley.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And <em>that</em> is another very good point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110147/#Comment_110147" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T15:33:07+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  3:33PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Alvin.<br/><br/>To be fair, I just realized that D&amp;D thought of it before I did.

In 2nd edition they call it a motivation and it's usually something like "Conquer the World". Either way, the better picture you have of where you want the character to end up can help drive action when that spotlight swings your way. So if they still want to be an unparalleled upstanding knight, then you can still ask where they want to go with that.<br/><br/>There is another difference, and I only realized this recently when trying to debate my preference that heroic gaming means the heroes shouldn't die from a bad roll. Long story short, there's a difference between saying "I want to be a hero" and having a game go "Okay, starting out as an incompetent boob, lets see how you get there" and "I want to be a hero" and having the game say "Okay, starting out as an incompetent boob, lets see if you can survive long enough to prove yourself worthy of that title."<br/><br/>D&amp;D does the latter. But for games where the spotlight shines brightest, I like the former method. And for those story heavy games, your approach seems like a great tool to help avoid paralysis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110191/#Comment_110191" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T22:09:42+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 10:09PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My cures (or defense or something not quite perfect) for this is character generation buy-in like beliefs in BW.
