(They have all played rpgs in the past but haven't for quite some time, i.e., they are familiar with the concept of rpgs.) I just think they'll like it thematically, and it seems to have a suitable time-frame for play and the right level of mechanical crunch for this group.<br/><br/>I own Committee; I've read through it. I've never played it--not even a demo.<br/><br/>Any tips for running the game generally to ensure it goes smoothly? Any tips for running the game for non-rpgers? Ways to streamline/simplify to ensure the time doesn't run long.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115081/#Comment_115081" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T12:15:00+00:00" title="December 18, 2007 12:15PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know what Committee is, so this will be pretty generic.  But I've had experience running for completely new players in a variety of games, so hopefully it will be useful.<br/><br/>First, front load them, but only as much as necessary. Usually, this involves whatever basic information is necessary. For something like Primetime Adventures, you can just quickly discuss the types of TV shows it excells at, and then brainstorm your show. For something more structured, only give setting detail they'll need to make an informed decision about character (or whatever) creation.<br/><br/>During actual creation, using a character sheet, go over everything on the sheet (assuming everything on the sheet is important) with special focus on what they need to make decisions on. Break this up as much as possible, if there are multiple stages (like in White Wolf games).<br/><br/>Don't hold back giving out rules advice at any point. Present them with two or three different options if they are stuck with the vastness of possibility (which can happen a lot), and make it clear these are only ideas. Translate ideas into rules as much as possible, but describe yourself doing it when possible, to help them understand.<br/><br/>Cheat sheets of actions and what it means in rules are great. Make the text stand out, so they can scan for text instead of numbers or whatever. Keep in mind that they'll almost certainly start out with this sheet as the be all end all of what is possible to accomplish. Try to make that as true as possible without cramming too much in (keep it to a page). If necessary, make a completely seperate page to reference after they have taken an action (like damage charts, or success levels).<br/><br/>Hopefully, it's like most indie games and pretty rules light.  Explain as you go. They're used to rules defining gameplay, as board gamers, so I don't think you'll have to worry too much about that.  Make it transparent. They are there to play a game, so don't hide the rules assuming it's going to be more enjoyable for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

How big of a group do you think you'll have, and how long do you want to play? Those numbers will help me best answer your streamlining questions.<br/><br/>I've got a <a href="http://ericjboyddesigns.com/The_Committee.aspx" rel="nofollow">demo kit</a> posted online that comes equipped with pregenerated characters that you can use to jump past character creation if you like. Brainstorming an expedition is such fun, though, that I recommend doing that together rather than using the sample in the demo kit. <br/><br/>For non-rpgers, emphasize that the game is about telling a story of adventure in the vein of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> or <i>Around the World in 80 Days</i>. Players can narrate whatever they want their character to have done and that's how it happened - there's no rolling for success like in other RPGs they may have played in the past. With that freedom realized, they do not have to try to resolve the entire hazard all at once, but can enjoy the interplay with their opposition and actually set up opportunities for their opposition to present complications. And the game rewards this by giving you more Acclaim for stretching the story out a bit to be as exciting as possible.<br/><br/>For example, there's the famous scene in the temple at the beginning of <i>Raiders</i> where everything seems to go wrong after grabbing the gold idol. Rather than escaping quickly, complications pile one upon another. That's the kind of scene that is fun to watch and fun to play. So leave openings for your opposition ("Then I took a flying leap across the pit." rather than "Then I leaped across the pit and took off running down the corridor and out into the jungle.").<br/><br/>To resolve things in time (especially with difficult hazards), use short bits of narration rather than going on and on. Using short, clipped back-and-forth with your opposition captures the tense mood of a knife fight or desperate attempts to disarm a bomb. For social hazards, remember that you're telling a story and not providing a transcript of everything that is said; focus on key one-liners and such, but otherwise be ready to summarize things.<br/><br/>For the first round of scenes, use easy hazards (1d10 or 2d10 difficulty) and use the timer to give an idea of the flow, but don't enforce the time limit. Hopefully that will get everyone understanding the flow of scenes. If someone appears stuck with mechanics during a scene, turn the hourglass on its side or stop the timer for a moment and explain their options. If they are just unsure what to say, though, let the timer run and let them sweat.<br/><br/>If you've got some players who are natural hams or actors or somesuch let them go first with you serving as their opposition. Once others see a fun scene played out, they'll follow in suit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.
