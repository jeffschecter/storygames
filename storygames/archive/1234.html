                    Hi everyone.<br/><br/>I started this as a preliminary to a tarot game that a friend and I are tossing around. I thought it might be worth posting here in its baby stage. This came out of the ideas I saw on the tarot thread here about positioning and spreads, and also out of Final Fantasy X-2 (which I do not recommend you play).<br/><br/>This will take a couple posts.<br/><br/>Each character's sheet is a sigil, consisting of circles and lines, that represents his or her abilities. All the circles on the sigil are connected by the lines, and all lines end at a circle. The lines may or may not intersect. See below for pretty pictures.<br/><br/>Circles can be open (with nothing in them) or filled (with a glyph in them). Most glyphs cannot cohabitate - in general only one glyph can be in a circle at a time. Glyphs can pass through each other temporarily, but cannot stay in the same circle.<br/><br/>Circles are rated as to their Precision - less precise circles have greater applicability but lower effects. A Precision 1 circle might be something like "physical activity," "conversation," or "magic." A Precision 2 circle narrows the field slightly, so "combat," "polite conversation," or "fire magic" would be appropriate. A Precision 3 circle is as precise as this game gets, and might be something like "rapiers," "high-class etiquette," or "fire-based enchantment." A higher-Precision circle must have a line to it that comes from a "parent" circle that is one Precision lower.<br/><br/>Lines indicate how the glyphs can move from one circle to another. They always have an arrow, which gives the direction glyphs must go. Intersections give a choice as to where the glyph goes, but they can occasionally be blocked, preventing glyphs from traveling down either line. A circle that has two lines pointing to a second circle, with no intersections on either, can never be filled - glyphs placed in that circle instantly and automatically flow to the next one.<br/><br/>Players create their characters' sigils. They have a certain number of lines, circles, and intersections to use.<br/><br/>Focused Characters:<br/>Circles:<br/>	P1: 3<br/>	P2: 2<br/>	P3: 3<br/>Lines: 10<br/>Intersections: none<br/><br/><br/>Average Characters:<br/>Circles:<br/>	P1: 4<br/>	P2: 2<br/>	P3: 1<br/>Lines: 11<br/>Intersections: 2<br/><br/><br/>Broad characters:<br/>Circles:<br/>	P1: 5<br/>	P2: 3<br/>	P3: 0<br/>Lines: 12<br/>Intersections: 4                </div>

                            Game Mechanics:<br/><br/>When you care about the outcome of an event and your character is in a position to change it, you can call for a contest. Everyone involved rolls 1d6. If there are several people involved, everyone picks who their opponents are before rolling.<br/><br/>You can describe as many actions or events as you like before you roll, but the effectiveness of them is based on how well you roll compared to others. It is best if you describe only the actions your character takes, not the effects of those actions on others!<br/><br/>If you have a circle that relates to this contest, you draw power from it, rolling extra dice equal to the Precision of the circle and taking the highest. If you roll more than one 6, add +1 for each extra 6. You can only count one circle of each Precision, so unless Glyphs intervene, you'll be rolling one die, two dice, four dice, or seven dice. You cannot choose not to draw power from an appropriate circle, though you can act as if you rolled any number that is lower than what you actually rolled.<br/><br/>Some glyphs change what you can or can't draw power from, or give other modifiers to your rolls.<br/><br/>The winner of the roll can place a glyph on the sigil of his own character or any opponent characters involved in the contest, in any open circle. Some glyphs have victory thresholds (VTs) required for their placement - unless you beat your opponents by a certain margin, you cannot choose certain glyphs. <br/><br/>When you can't roll any dice, you're out of the contest. The last person in a contest is the winner, and gets to specify its outcome. The winner cannot specify occurrences that have nothing to do with the original event.<br/><br/><br/>Glyphs:<br/><br/>You start with two glyphs on your sigil: the Glyph of Fortune and the Glyph of Tragedy. You can place these wherever you like.<br/><br/>Each time you enter a contest, you can choose to take up to four moves on your sigil. Each move transfers a glyph from its current circle down a line to an open circle. You can pick which path the glyph takes at an intersection. You cannot move a particular glyph more than once per roll.<br/><br/>You can also spend several moves to "unload" a circle, removing a glyph that is currently there. If there are multiple glyphs on one circle (such as the Glyph of Freezing), you can only unload one of those glyphs. The cost is the Glyph's VT.<br/><br/>If ever you have less than two glyphs on your sigil, the Glyph of Tragedy appears (unless it is the last glyph the sigil) in a circle of your choice. If only the Glyph of Tragedy is on your sigil, add the Glyph of Fortune in a circle of your choice. These do not cost you any moves.  You can also use two moves to place the Glyph of Tragedy or the Glyph of Fortune on your own sigil if they are not currently on it.                        </div>

                            Glyph Effects:<br/><br/>Chaos: A circle occupied by the Glyph of Chaos must change each time you roll: it must be filled with a different glyph, or change from filled to open. If this does not happen by the time you roll, you lose one die from your roll, regardless of whether you draw power from that circle.  Only the Glyphs of Negation or Law can remove this Glyph - regular moves cannot. This glyph can cohabitate with other glyphs, except for the Glyph of Law - if both of these are placed the same circle, both disappear.<br/><br/>Dismissal: This glyph can only be placed on a sigil that has no circles related to the current event. Characters with this glyph are removed from the current contest, and cannot rejoin it. This glyph then vanishes at the end of the contest.<br/><br/>Fortune: Add one point to your final roll if the Glyph of Fortune is on one of the circles you drew from.<br/><br/>Law: This glyph prevents a circle from being changed. One must first remove the Glyph of Law in order to add or remove glyphs from this circle. Only the Glyphs of Negation or Chaos can remove this Glyph - regular moves cannot. This glyph can cohabitate with other glyphs, except for the Glyph of Chaos - if both of these are placed the same circle, both disappear.<br/><br/>Mist: This glyph simply fills a circle. It has no other effects. <br/><br/>Negation: The Glyph of Negation must be placed on a filled circle. It removes an existing glyph from the sigil. This glyph then disappears. The VT required for this glyph is the same as the VT of the glyph to be removed.<br/><br/>Obstruction: Glyphs cannot pass through the circle that the Glyph of Obstruction occupies. <br/><br/>Pain: Instead of drawing power from the circle this glyph occupies, you subtract the number of dice you would normally add. You can only have one glyph of pain on your sigil at a time - if a second one would be placed, it removes the first.<br/><br/>Power: Roll an extra die if you draw power from the circle this glyph fills.<br/><br/>Roadblock: The Roadbloack Glyph is placed on an intersection rather than a circle. No glyphs can be moved through this intersection.<br/><br/>Tragedy: Subtract one point from your final roll if the Glyph of Tragedy is on one of the circles you drew from.<br/><br/>Victory: Add this glyph to any existing glyph on your sigil. The enhanced glyph cannot be affected by the Glyph of Negation - your opponents must first negate the Glyph of Victory.<br/><br/>Void: You cannot draw power from any circle covered by the Glyph of the Void.<br/><br/>Wandering: This glyph moves in a randomly chosen direction after each dice roll the player makes. This does not cost the player any glyph moves, and cannot displace existing glyphs. If the Wandering Glyph enters the same circle as the Glyph of Law, it stays there.<br/><br/><br/>Glyph		VT required<br/>Chaos		2<br/>Dismissal	2<br/>Fortune		1<br/>Law			2<br/>Mist		1<br/>Negation	*<br/>Obstruction	2<br/>Pain		3<br/>Power		1<br/>Roadblock	1<br/>Tragedy		1<br/>Victory		3<br/>Void		1<br/>Wandering	1                        </div>

                            This is looking really awesome to me. You've managed to capture the flavor of the placement-counts aspect of Tarot reading that I was interested in, but had such a vague idea about, and you've removed the interpretation ambiguity by defining your own glyphs. I like that glyphs can be played on others' as well as one's own sigil.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, questions: <br/>
<br/>
Are glyphs drawn randomly at need from a draw pile during conflict, or do players collect them during game, creating a hand? (If collect-as-they-go, do you see glyphs as XP replacement, random found items (loot the villagers!), side-quest-style rewards, or something else?)<br/>
<br/>
Do you foresee a problem with creating NPC sigils? Intuitively, I feel it could be rather quickly done, even on the fly, but I could be wrong.                        </div>

                            Actually, I was thinking the sigils and glyphs would be a purely game-mechanics item. In certain settings they might be magical constructs that others could intentionally block, but here they're just representations.<br/><br/>If one wanted to be more tactically- or resource-oriented, one could give characters different glyphs and/or a limited number of them to use, with certain ways to restore them (Dying Earth's refreshes come to mind). For instance, in a Tarot-based game, it's possible that you could only use each card/glyph once, creating a limited number among all characters.                        </div>

The idea of the story itself having a sigil is pretty cool - you could put glyphs on it via abilities like SA's Themes, and it would oppose your actions (or modify NPC rolls?) to different degrees depending on what circles it has. Whether you'd want it to have inclusive or exclusive circles is a different question - do they tell you "you shouldn't do this, because it's heavily opposed," or "you should do this, because it's easier"?                        </div>

                            Oh, so double arrow trumps any Glyphs already on a circle? Say, in your Physical --&gt; --&gt; Luck example above, Luck has Mist on it. If you place a Glyph on Physical, does it displace Mist? I'm not sure I follow.<br/><br/>I was pondering the Pain Glyph "evaporating" with time (healling), so that each scene a character makes it through without conflict, the glyph moves up a level of precision (like electrons and standard current) say from Rapiers to Combat to Physical to "poof". What do you think of that, and how might double-arrows affect that? I see two options: they negate the effect, or they work the same way, but wick the pain immediately up.
<blockquote>depending on what circles it has. Whether you'd want it to have inclusive or exclusive circles is a different question -</blockquote>
Yeah, that's the big question, innit. I need to think about what are the "Attributes" of story. What analogues of physical, mental, social exist for the story?<br/><br/>So, I'm thinking of other shapes on the Sigil. Squares for Paths; triangles for Traits. These would only be Primary, or Precision 1, but could link down to a circle of any precision. Hmm. Could they link to each other? Anyway, you get to spend some kind of lucre earned through gameplay to load up the Paths and Traits with glyphs that then trickle down. Or you take glyph damage to them, like circles. Or whatever. Needs thought. I figure you'd also get to spend lucre to add circles, links, etc. to the Sigil.<br/><br/>Q                        </div>

You could have some Dogs style proto NPCs, where the GM ahead of time makes an arrangement of circles and arrows but dosn't define what they are until gameplay requires it.                        </div>

                            In my mind the double-arrow wouldn't work if the target circle was already occupied, but there are certainly more sophisticated ways to do things as well. So Mist would block anything that the double arrows would move. The double arrows say, "If it is legal to move a glyph off this circle in this direction, make it so, immediately, without cost to the PC."<br/><br/>The attributes of the story should be tailored to the game you want to make. One of my favorite examples here would be the game "Don't Rest Your Head," where each scene is dominated by either Discipline, Exhaustion, Madness, or Pain. There is no "happy fluffy bunnies dominate this scene" option. Choosing the game's circles says a lot about what sort of game it is. Perhaps you could set a certain number of core elements that reflect the feel of your game, and give examples of other things that could lead the game in different directions.                        </div>

Ah. So you only pay to move into the circle, and the double arrow get's you the next move free. That's not as powerful, but still useful.

Right. Instead of trying to go all academic and boil "story" down to it's compnents. This is why I keep you around. 9^&gt;<br/><br/>Q                        </div>

                            No, unfortunately. This whole thing has moved onto the back burner and is likely to stay there for a while as I work on other stuff. Thanks for the interest, though. There were several possibilities that came up when I was looking through the fonts discussion a week or two ago, but I went and graded some exams instead. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Not to drag this one from hibernation prematurely, but that diagram reminds me of the "maru/badzu" system of marking in Japan.  Basically when I took Japanese, my homework and tests were marked either with "maru" 〇 (circle, for good) or "batsu" × (bad).  <br/>
<br/>
 But there is also "sankaku" △ (okay) and "niiju maru" ◎ for excellent. <br/>
<br/>
This system doesn't have the neat quality yours does where you can keep upgrading a node by adding rings, but it makes a visually distinctive four-level marking system.  You know that anything circular is good and anything with corners needs improvement, and anything with volume is at least okay.                        </div>
