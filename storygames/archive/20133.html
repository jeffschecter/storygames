The lucky ones, escaped in space, into enormous orbiting space stations. The majority, poor bastards, remained stuck on the planet. You play the role of robot-pilots: you're two or three generations down the line of those who moved to space and your daily job is to go to the control room, suit up and connect with cyborgs on the planet from your transmit-bed.<br/>You get assigned to missions (clean up some mess, escort someone or something, investigate a problem, fight some bastards and so on) and when your shift is up, you disconnect. It's a taxing job, even if you don't risk your own skin. <br/>How do you cope with the shit you have to do? Do you bring this stuff home with you? How do you cope with the marks of war, in a society used to live in relative peace, among the silence of the stars?</i><br/><br/>The game is a mix of AW and Fate, with influences from Blades in the dark and Monsterhearts.<br/>There are some new mechanics (how you roll, suffer consequences, earn XP, countdown trees), and some recycled ones (moves, improvements, countdown clocks, conditions, strings and tags).<br/>At this stage the game is composed by a short intro, some basic instructions for mechanics, a few pilots and a few cyborgs playbooks to get started. There is the bare minimum for the GM to run the game, but there should be no major bugs.<br/><br/><b>What I\u2019m looking for: someone willing to take and read the game as it is, and take it for a spin with their group. </b><br/>I\u2019ve got only so much free time, and I am very busy playtesting other stuff at the moment, but I had this idea, designed around it for around a month, and I\u2019d like someone to give it a blind try. The system should be playable, and I hope enjoyable.<br/><br/>If you want to get yourself a copy of the current alpha \u2013 either comment here or drop me a message.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444676/#Comment_444676" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T20:27:35+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  8:27PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen Ben Lehman's <i>Bliss Stage</i>?<br/><br/>You should, if you haven't!

My game on the other hand places also importance on the relationships but at this stage with no scores.<br/>More important, while in Bliss it looks really important to build positive relationships, in my alpha the attitude towards other pilots can span freely from friendship to animosity, and even open conflict. The other pilots, in my game, are used basically <i>as tools</i> to dump or reduce stress and tension, in real life (while they're necessarily your partners on a mission).<br/><br/>Also, the "enemy" in the game is different. In Bliss Stage we've got aliens, while here <i>the pilots are 'strangers' to Earth</i>.<br/>They don't deal with emotionally easy killings, I'd say. Yes, they might shoot at some armored vehicle or another robot or cyborg on the planet. <i>But most of the times they'd be dealing with other humans.</i><br/>I think this clearly defines the missions (the 'war' part of the game, a less social one...) as a <i>clear trigger for the stress and tension that pilots will accumulate</i>.<br/>You might bind with other pilots by sharing this shitty job, rather than by being together against aliens.<br/><br/>This comes to the final part of my comparison: in Bliss Stage it looks like the pilots and anchors group is clearly united (besides occasional broken relationships I'd say) against a common enemy.<br/><i>In this game there is not a clear enemy</i>; or actually, it's the signs that war leaves on the pilot. <br/>There is world of relationships (with other pilots, with NPCs...) awaiting each character, on their space station. They would probably be functional relationships (or dysfunctional only up to a limit..) if not for the pilot's stress and tension, which will be the trigger for the problems that characters will experience while not on a mission...<br/><br/>I hope this differentiates the game enough (besides the purely mechanical bits)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444716/#Comment_444716" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T16:44:41+00:00" title="April  9, 2015  4:44PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dunno how useful it can be, but<a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/mission-generator-for-316/" rel="nofollow"> here's a mission generator</a> I made for 3:16 that goes well with many games where players are in an army and the GM doesn't want to do much prep or worry too much about creating missions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444751/#Comment_444751" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-11T21:17:42+00:00" title="April 11, 2015  9:17PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WM, you need to turn that bad boy into a Fiasco play set.  :-D                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444897/#Comment_444897" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-21T19:56:45+00:00" title="April 21, 2015  7:56PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If someone is curious to see the results of the first revision, <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/148090/xpandables" rel="nofollow">the game beta is avail. on RpgNow as PWYW</a><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> - thanks again for the mission generator!
