And, when I run games, I tend to try to make my fantasy worlds fairly ethnically diverse.  So, I am often faced with the challenge of finding art for non-white characters - and, this is rather difficult sometimes.  It's not that there's NOTHING out there - it's just harder to find, especially if you want art that puts non-white characters in more standard fantasy garb or situations (e.g., an asian who isn't a samurai/ninja, or an african-looking fellow without a spear).<br/><br/>If I had an artistic bone in my body, I would just make a bunch of relevant art.  But I don't.  And if I had a million dollars, I would commission someone to do a bunch and then just give it away.*  But I do not.<br/><br/>So, I'm trying to think of a way to create a resource for folks looking for character art that isn't of white folks - and my secret agenda is also for it to be out there for other people to find, so that when they're looking for character art, they might say, "wow, this black guy with the badass sword is awesome!" and the fictional world will become a little bit more diverse.  I'd like the final product to be available online for free (or very cheap) and maybe sell a printed copy through something like lulu at cost.  I'd also like artists to get reasonably compensated for their contributions - this isn't a call for charity art.  And, while I'm willing to kick in a bit of my own money, I can't invest a huge amount.<br/><br/>I don't have any great ideas on how to do this - except that someone wise told me, "post this idea on SG."  My best one so far is to figure out a reasonable rate to pay an artist for a portrait, then put up a project on something like Fundable for 10 or 20 times that, and "ransom" the project.  But I'm open to anyone who knows what the heck they're doing and would like to see something like this exist, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202047/#Comment_202047" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T18:14:31+00:00" title="April 14, 2009  6:14PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One model that might work would be to make it a charity project.

They are military, but they cover a truckload of cultures and time periods.  If you want Joe Average images, try looking for costume reference manuals for certain areas and eras used by historians and wardrobe designers.  Some of this is hard to come by or pricey, but not always.  <br/><br/>It is a good idea to know the term for the costume or character type you are looking for in the native language.  Do a Google image search for a hougan, gurkha, or a shugenja will get you closer to what you need.  It is not a safe assumption to make that artists in Korea sit around and make fantasy art of Western Knights or that Spanish artists do not have a picture of El Cid or two (although he is very Western, and thus assages none of your guilt, I fear [grin]).  Google language tools can help you with that as well.  Translate the term "ancient warrior" or "wizard" in the target language and do some test searches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202061/#Comment_202061" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T21:12:38+00:00" title="April 14, 2009  9:12PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>...would be Osprey books</blockquote>\nThis series is indeed awesome.

If you go the Story Games Names Book route and put the proceeds towards charity, and get artists to donate their work to the project you run up against other problems. For one thing, you'll still want quantity, but it's harder to ask for quantity if you're not paying. For another thing, you tend to get what you pay for, and if you're not paying anything, you could wind up with a lot of well-meaning crap. <br/><br/>You should think of some methods to make the creation of these images as easy as possible. Sticking to greyscale images is one obvious solution. Keeping the size small is another. Think headshots, webforum avatar-sized. Have some examples of what you'd generally like to see and what you don't want to see handy. Make a specific website for this project, outlining all the specs and info. <br/><br/>You'll probably want a lot more artists than this community has on hand. There are a bunch of drawing groups that do a sketch-a-week based on a different subject every week. Maybe you could get your foot in the door at one of these places. Livejournal artists are prone to go meme-crazy on occasion. A couple years ago someone said "Let's redesign Batgirl" and a couple of hundred people jumped on that bandwagon through a convoluted chain of friends lists. One thing in your favour is that comic people are pretty charmed with dorky stuff now. If it's for charity, that could help spark another one of these crazes.<br/><br/>One last thing: While character portraits are nice, and your cause is one I sympathise with greatly, I wonder how useful or interesting a book of portraits alone (unless it had some really good work in it) would be to your average gamer. I'm an artist myself, but to be honest, I don't really care about portraits of my gaming characters, beyond a loose sketch on scratch paper if the game's in a lull. I think there needs to be more value added to this project if it's to be appealing to creators and consumers alike. It needs something to bump it up beyond 'kinda neat idea' to 'must have this'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202209/#Comment_202209" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T18:19:15+00:00" title="April 15, 2009  6:19PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My wife has chatted with me about this on many occasions.

I am very guilty of writing game Demos full of not characters with not defined race. I do try and have one or two female characters.. <br/><br/>But back to the topic at hand. Part of the problem is that some artists do not seem to know how to draw non-white people. This is easily seen with art of black women, often what I find are darkly colored thin woman.

I replied that I indeed have black communities there too, which I have, but then; I've never really <i>played </i>those black communities. In fact only one character have originated from one of these black communities in 20 years, and that's it. No yellows or reds or browns. So I felt guilty as hell, after thinking a bit ...<br/><br/>Any perceived problem should have a working solution. So I have made myself a solution, political correct it is, but still; a good one. The people of my world will no longer be all whites; they will live in cultures with a variety of skin tones, like most of us really do. They will have skin colors ranging from black to yellow, the intermixing of skin-tone being part of the overall culture of all men, in whatever setting I use in my fantasy world. The only exemption is my green and black orcs, my coal-grey gnomes, and my dusty-grey dwarves.<br/><br/>I look forward to writing up a new edition of my game with this incorporated. I am excited about how this will influence my writing, and translate into functional game-elements. I will  have to work it into the character-sheet, of course, creating a space for skin-color. And I look forward to have some great art supporting the fact of multicolored cultures in my world.<br/><br/>The link provided by Daniel is invaluable in that respect.
