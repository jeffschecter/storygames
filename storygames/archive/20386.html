So here's the first one. <i>SkipJack</i> does for character creation what <i>Microscope</i> does for world building. In the game, the players choose from a list of everyday household objects - cheque stubs, umbrella, computer monitor etc. - and weave a story around them by taking each in turn and framing scenes involving them which attempt to tell us something about the mysterious Protagonist at the heart of the story. <br/><br/>So in other words the player group creates a character from scratch, and roleplays that character and any salient NPCs that may appear along the way. I've only had one playtest so far, but it was amazing how the players were able to build up a whole life trajectory purely from a bunch of objects. I think I need another two or three playtests before I can  release a beta version  into the wild, so if any o' y'all fancy giving it a spin,  feel free. Naturally, all playtesters will be credited in  the eventual book (if you let me know who you are!).<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home/Public?preview=SkipJack+(cover).pdf" rel="nofollow">Cover</a><br/><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/SkipJack.pdf" rel="nofollow">Insides</a><br/><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/SkipJack%20AP%20report.pdf" rel="nofollow">Session report</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts" title="Hybridartifacts"><img alt="Hybridartifacts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts">Hybridartifacts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449107/#Comment_449107" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-24T15:11:42+00:00" title="October 24, 2015  3:11PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People are very good at constructing meaning and connections between things that dont really much if any by way of actual connections. In a way that's how conspiracy theories work and I have read a novel where that is what the writer does and the conspiracy is based on something totally mundane, in fact a shopping list. So there is a parallel there with what you are doing with SkipJack.<br/><br/>Its also a little bit like the power you can get with something like film editing. There is a film joke about Charles Bronson and his lack of expression:<br/><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BkTsZoSCMAEmcnI.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BkTsZoSCMAEmcnI.jpg</a><br/>But actually for some directors his lack of expression actually helps them to convey emotion in the film because they fill it in with what they are cutting to or from and music. The editing of the film and the atmosphere of the music creates the meaning. Charles Bronson looks at an innocent being attacked to dramatic music - the emotion reads as anger. He looks at a starving child while mournful cellos play - his emotion is sadness.<br/><br/>Its all ultimately about juxtaposition and the way we learn to read events by cause and effect. If you put two objects together and tell people they are related, people will construct a relationship and invent that cause and effect relationship.<br/><br/>I think you would have a lot of potential there and a bit of a fun twist to the sort of approach already taken by something like Rory's Story Cubes.<br/><br/>Have you tried having players each bring several objects or pictures of objects to a  game and using those in the same way?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449108/#Comment_449108" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-24T15:59:14+00:00" title="October 24, 2015  3:59PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2015 3:55PM by catty_big.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some very interesting comments, thanks. To take you up on three of them:\n<blockquote>If you put two objects together and tell people they are related, people will construct a relationship and invent that cause and effect relationship.</blockquote>\nPrecisely. It's similar to the way connections between characters and objects etc. work in games like <i>Fiasco</i>. As you say, people are very imaginative when it comes to this sort of thing, for the reasons you mention regarding conspiracy theories, to whit the human need to make sense of seemingly random events.\n<blockquote>I think you would have a lot of potential there and a bit of a fun twist to the sort of approach already taken by something like Rory's Story Cubes.</blockquote>\nYes, I'm envisaging something akin to Rory's Story Cubes.\n<blockquote>Have you tried having players each bring several objects or pictures of objects to a  game and using those in the same way?</blockquote>\nAaaah, even more player-generated content. That's a very good idea. I'll consider that when running sessions in  future, probably when the game's a bit more firmly established, as I don't want to run the risk in playtests of people not turning up with objects, or not feeling comfortable doing so, but I can certainly ask players in pre-planned games to bring objects along. Thanks for the suggestion.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts" title="Hybridartifacts"><img alt="Hybridartifacts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts">Hybridartifacts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449123/#Comment_449123" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-25T15:53:53+00:00" title="October 25, 2015  3:53PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be honest I find it more appealing that Story Cubes that always struck me a bit dry and inflexible.

If you fancy making a playset, as my playtester Chirag Asnani did (<i>Fallout Shelter</i> in the doc), feel free.
