All of the people I gamed with are awesome. Not merely good -- awesome.<br/>\n2. Eating only when hungry works out well, but keep a bit of emergency chow in the bag.<br/>\n3. Traveling without electronics I know I won't need works out well, and means I can get through security checkpoints faster, and with fewer bins.<br/>\n4. That said, and with apologies to all, next time I really must bring the wheeled suitcase for the main shopping run. I tried to do without this time, and my knees are still paying for this, as in going up and down stairs hurts them. Today is Monday. My shopping run was Thursday, and ended at 1 pm, when I sent most of the loot home via the friendly UPS booth.<br/>\n5. The further one gets from the action, even on the same streets, the less crowded the restaurant. Josh and I had no wait to get into Ruth Chris on Friday night during prime dinner hours.<br/>\n6. About those five hour energy drinks -- there is danged well a crash at the end, and I only had half a bottle. While it did prevent dozing in the middle of a game, I'm going to have to find a different way to do that.<br/>\n7. Pre-convention research really pays off. I had a focused list of the booths to check out and the things to buy. The online walk through of the Exhibit Hall, even though it was utterly bare bones, using a map, not the actual territory, meant that I knew my way around most areas. I only got lost once, which leads to...<br/>\n8. Yes, Virginia, it really does take 20-30 minutes to go from the Exhibit Hall to the JW Marriott, at least if one is set on avoiding going outdoors, which I was. (I also allowed 25 minutes for the trip, so I was fine.)<br/>\n9. Signing up for no or few events (i.e., 3 or fewer) is totally viable, especially if you like impromptu demos. Once you have scheduled events, pick up gaming becomes harder to coordinate. This doesn't mean one shouldn't sign up for events, but it's a trade off.<br/>\n10. I need to be more focused in my roleplaying. I don't suck, but it's more like tossing a bucket of paint at the target. I generally do hit the target, often really accurately, but I also slosh beyond the target, and I'd like to rein that in.<br/>\n11. It is harder not to corpse in tabletop than in a larp. In a larp, people generally save the laughter and praise for after the game. In a tabletop, this is not always the case.<br/>\n12. Simon Rogers of Pelgrane really, really gets good customer service.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337659/#Comment_337659" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T13:37:34+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  1:37PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you buy 'eight things'?<br/><br/>Were they the same 8 things you expected to buy?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337665/#Comment_337665" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T14:07:00+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  2:07PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2011 2:07PM by Valamir.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">6.

The biggest benefit of the 5 hour energy is the mega doses of B, which can have all kinds of strange effects if you normally don't get sufficient B.

I basically only had Sunday for exhibit hall walking-through. The rest of my time felt like it was monopolized by the four games I ran. I only <i>played</i> in three games, so seven games total. At Strategicon, I normally do seven games total in three days (running two or three), but then again there's really nothing to do there <i>but</i> run and play games. The shopping is no better than my FLGS (but without the familiar faces behind the counter).<br><br>Next year, assuming I'm going again next year, I'm cutting back on scheduled stuff for sure.

One turned into a refund (GM didn't show, and I'm hoping it wasn't an unexpected crisis-had-to-cancel-vacation situation), and one I returned because it got in the way of other things. I picked up an actual event ticket for Morgan Ellis' "In For A Penny Dreadful", which was a total blast, but everything else I played I did on generics. 4 GoD games, the Kerberos Fate game, the Laundry game I genericed into, the Call of Cthulhu game that only took generics, and the Amaranthine demo, which didn't require a ticket.

Attendance was way up. People had record Thursday / Friday sales.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Taking Emergency C every day kept me from getting sick even though I was around a lot of sick people.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Taking lozenges, eating apples, and breathing deeply from my stomach kept my voice intact.<br/>\n<br/>\n- When you take a lot of risks, you will eventually get burned. I got burned a lot. BUT in every situation I learned quite a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Games on Demand is excellent and Gen Con needs it!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Indianapolis is full of welcoming people and the food is pretty good if you take the time to explore / research.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Gen Con is expensive for non-attendees. You have to pay extra if you want a microphone for your seminar?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Gen Con is change. Wizards and White Wolf had a diminished presence. Smaller companies rose up.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Wizards of the Coast is strange. They hired a PR company to run their booth (or Hasbro hired them to manage PR for all of Hasbro). The PR staff didn't know much about D&amp;D;, most products were behind glass cases, you couldn't buy anything, and they didn't know very basic information (when and where can I buy your new hot products).<br/>\n<br/>\n- I love my Gen Con friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Gen Con seminars, like games, can be hit or miss BUT with seminars, you can easily walk out of one and join another in progress with little effort. I had a great time attending seminars.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Paizo continued to dominate.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Pelgrane Press is one of the friendliest companies at Gen Con. And their products rock as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Mouse Guard Box set is stunning. Everything I wanted (except more dice). Burning Wheel Gold was very deservedly successful.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Stealing Cthulhu is a gem. I immediately read it on the trip back home.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Clarity is important. I was going to buy 4 copies of Dungeon World for myself and friends but it was unclear if it was an Ashcan, a full game, a starter game, or something else. The book itself may have said what it was but it had a rubber band around it that I didn't want to remove to find out. I know I will eventually buy it (I've already played a few times).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Kagematsu is in demand (at least among my circle of friends). But I couldn't find it for sale anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Freemarket is very underrated. It's a brilliant game.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Many wonderful, intelligent, caring, sweet people attend Gen Con and it is a pleasure to be in their company.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337758/#Comment_337758" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T06:59:49+00:00" title="August  9, 2011  6:59AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2011 7:00AM by Mike_Olson.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br>He's also a great player!

I did run Fiasco Sunday afternoon a GoD and having been self taught found out I was doing something things wrong. So, awesome that I now know how to run Fiasco correctly.<br/><br/>Few things I learned:<br/><br/>1. If your interested in popular places like the Stake-n-Shake or the Ram they are almost empty during off hours. Managed to get into the Ram bar area with no wait around 4 on Friday.<br/><br/>2. Non-scheduled games are a lot more fun than scheduled game (for me).<br/><br/>3. Even when you say "I'm just going to buy PDFs from now on" there is no resisting the dealers room.<br/><br/>4. Packing a snack and mint is extremely helpful.<br/><br/>5. Dungeon crawls can be fun with the right game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
