I don't want to be overwhelmed by menu choices, though. I like a certain amount of structure but please don't bury me in it. I want the stuff there to inspire me to create a great character. By the time I have created my character, I should be itching to play.<br/><br/>Writing and Presentation:<br/><br/>If the game has a fair bit of "crunch" to it, then this chapter needs to be easily referenced. Don't make it hard for me to figure out the target numbers for my perception skill. Don't make it hard for me to find the process for leveling up my ranger.<br/><br/>At the same time, make the process for creating a character simple to follow. The process itself can be complicated, but make it transparent through clear writing and good layout. Don't make me flip around. The D&amp;D 4E Player's Handbook drives me crazy, for example. There's this great page or two telling you how to create your character in a few (okay, a billion) easy steps, but each step requires you to flip to the right section. The sections are laid-out in order of use during creation; couldn't they have put the instructions for 1st level and subsequent levels in each section? Then I could just flip from section to section, grab what I need, and finish my character.<br/><br/>Duplicate stuff if it makes it easier for the player! Yes, "Don't Repeat Yourself" is a mighty fine goal, but don't overdo it at the expense of your audience. Repetition begets clarity.

In D&amp;D4e it's very clear that you're making a team of "adventurers", and that you need to get together with your friends and build a balanced party (in terms of roles and such).<br/><br/>On the other hand, the old WoD games were IMO so open in the range of possible situations that the Storyteller absolutely had to provide some semblance of a starting point, despite how specific the characters outwardly seemed. You're all Kindred/vampires, but what the hell are the characters doing with themselves? Are they a vampire street gang, corporate schemers, a cabal of blood mages, fangy superheroes, etc.? Rifts, especially if you have lots of the supplements, has an absolutely dizzying array of character options, and (last I checked; I never looked at Rifts Ultimate) no guidance at all as to how to go about choosing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189602/#Comment_189602" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T12:43:06+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 12:43PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Duplicate stuff if it makes it easier for the player!</blockquote>\nYes.

Dangle possibilities in front of me. Give me character ideas I might not have thought of on my own. But also, be honest. Tell me which decisions are the most important. Say things like "Your character's race is one of the most important choices you can make, because not only does it affect how everyone else in the game world reacts to you, it also ties in with this, that, and this other game mechanic," or, "Your starting Traits paint a picture of what your character is like at the beginning of the story, but don't agonize over them too long -- every time you roll a '1' you'll alter a Trait or add a new one, so that after a couple of hours of play your character could be quite different from the one you started out with."<br/><br/>Also, don't just tell me what my character can do, give me an idea of what it will be like to <i>play</i> that character. "Loremeisters are masters of arcane secrets and obscure trivia. When questions about the game world come up, all eyes -- including the GM's -- will be on you. During combat you won't be doing much more than shouting encouragement from the sidelines, but you'll be helping to create the world that you're all exploring." "As a Smashitarian, you'll be rolling ridiculous fistfuls of dice, adding up frighteningly large numbers, and narrating gruesome deaths for your hapless foes.

Don't tell me how I'm going to roll dice while I'm making my character.  Then, at the same time, don't let me make decisions in character creation without knowing how those decisions will impact play.  Which is, yeah, kind of tough.  So for instance, in GURPS, there's a little table that tells me that a skill of 14 means I'll succeed 91% of the time. It doesn't tell me how I roll dice, but it does give me an idea of what my skill of 14 means.<br/><br/>And you can go softer than hard percentages, of course.  "Four dice in Strength means that you can hurl boulders and shit" is great \u2014 but be very, very careful that such statements are accurate.  One of the biggest failings of oWoD books is that they vastly inflated the competency of skills; if I had a 3 in Science, that was supposed to make me an expert, but was absolutely no guarantee that I'd regularly make Science checks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke" title="NoahTheDuke"><img alt="NoahTheDuke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke">NoahTheDuke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189873/#Comment_189873" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T20:33:19+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  8:33PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exhibit A: The Burning Wheel<br/>\nThis game has an extensive character creation process that requires multiple times when you need to reference other parts of the book. And yet, because of the way that the initial character creation processes are labeled and presented right up front, with a well thought out example and a two-page worksheet as a guiding hand with places for all needed notes, you never feel quite as overwhelmed as the process looks like it should. The lifepath lists are daunting, and the traits can be hard to find, but the steps are easy to follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nExhibit B: Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>\nThis game's conversational tone helps immensely with character creation, as he makes creating a character feel less serious business and like a chore, and more like a collaborative, playful effort between you and the author.
