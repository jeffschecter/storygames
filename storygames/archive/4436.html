It's a lovely little convention in a community centre. I've run Fear Itself (superb) and playtested WordPlay (good too); Rich has run Agon (must have been good, had Lego) and played Bliss Stage (when I stopped by their table, everyone was saying "Shit...").<br/><br/>It's time for the evening session, and there's few players and few games on offer. I offer to run Lacuna, without the book, while drinking a bottle of wine. Sadly, I only get two takers, which is a shame because it would have been great.<br/><br/>Instead, me and Rich end up playing Aeternal Legends, a sort of modern-day Changeling-like thing. The author, Stewart, is there, and he's really nice. We admire the cover art before the game and Rich and someone else buy the game before playing. I opt for caution instead.<br/><br/>And then we start. Um, this is a placeholder post, really. I don't have time to write the full play report, but I wanted to say about running Lacuna while drinking wine. I'll get back to this later, or Rich can take it.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100164/#Comment_100164" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T08:49:29+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  8:49AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it must be said, the pregenerated characters don't show the system off well.<br/><br/>I'm a gnome illusionist. This sounds rather cool (indeed, illusionism turns out to play a big part in the adventure).<br/><br/>Now, I've got three special skills. One takes a day to use. One takes a week. This isn't <i>ideal</i>, given that our entire adventure takes a day. That leaves me with one special skill, which I can't remember much about: I think it gave me an extra die on certain rolls.<br/><br/>Stewart attempts to explain the illusion system to me, but I protest I've had two glasses of wine and can't really focus on it. He relents.<br/><br/>There's a little too much pre-game explanation of the setting. Rich is cracking me up, at this point, because every time there's a pause, he says "Well..." brightly, meaning "Well, shall we start, then?". Each time, this is followed by more pre-game talk. On the fourth or fifth attempt, Rich changes this to "Let's start!", and we do.<br/><br/>We start...oh...Rich can definitely do this bit, he'll be more amusing than me. You know, if he wants to.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Like Graham says, I'd spent the morning running Agon and having a ball.  I spent the afternoon playing Bliss Stage and that was... interesting, in that it's the only game I've ever played where a pedo on meth tells you to drive your giant robot into the magical technicolour dream elevator to the dark side of the moon and you think it's a good idea.  But it was fun in a deeply wrong way.<br/><br/>I was aware that Stewart was going to this Con and I have to admit that I was more than a little curious about the game.  I like Urban Fantasy.  I'd seen the book and thought it looked nice.  I came very close to picking it up from Lulu, but didn't because by the time I put that order in I knew Stewart was going to be at this con.  I figured I'd get to have a look at the book first and save on postage.  So I was curious to play the game.  Stew seemed like a really nice bloke.  He apparently writes freelance Werewolf stuff for WW when he's not doing his own game.  Graham has managed to write a sign-up sheet for his Lacuna game which says something like "The GM will get pissed up, it'll be great!" and funnily enough nobody really wants to play.  So it ends up with 4 of us (Graham, Fabian, Shane and myself) in a demo/session of Aeternal Legends.<br/><br/>As Graham has mentioned, Stew explains the setting, which seems pretty straightforward in that it's urban fantasy with elves and stuff but "normal" people see the dwarves and gnomes and orks and trolls as regular joes.  Pretty standard stuff, basically Changeling without the baggage as far as I can tell. Some people are Legends, which is people chosen by the universe to do great things.  Also sounds familiar to me, but still pretty cool.   Stew takes great pains to explain that this isn't just another fantasy game and it's not full of clich\xc3\xa9s.  For example, elves don't have pointy ears in this setting (unless they're the one n the cover of the book) but do have some inhuman feature.  Pointy ears would be a valid option there, but the one in the game he was running had clockwork eyes instead.  Which I thought was way cool.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>We start...oh...Rich can definitely do this bit,</blockquote>\nWe start, and our characters (an Elf, a Dwarf, a Human and a Gnome) are all in a bar, when, I shit you not in the least, an old man (a gnome actually) walks over to us and asks us to find his kidnapped daughter.<br/><br/>Stewart, if you're reading this mate, I love the book and think the setting and system work just fine.  But really man, you need to do something about the way you try and sell this game, at cons at least.  I mean, I basically enjoyed the game, but really IT STARTED WITH THE CHARACTERS IN A TAVERN GETTING ASKED TO RESCUE SOME BLOKE'S KIDNAPPED DAUGHTER!  Is it possible to hit someone with a bigger clich\xc3\xa9 stick than that?

(There's a passage in the book that talks about how wizards find you in bars and ask you to do things *all the time,* and that after a while you take it in stride).

It's like "quite good".<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd run Fear Itself earlier the day: a game which, almost by design, is a railroad. (That's a misrepresentation but not a complete one.) Bear in mind I like Fear Itself: it does this illusionistic type of mystery game very well.<br/><br/>As our scenario progressed, it became clear it was a similar thing: we'd investigate something, we'd pass on to the next location, we'd investigate a bit more, we'd move on. It was interesting and, like I say, moderately fun, but you did feel you were on an unstoppable track. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the ride. I enjoyed my character, in fact, and spent a pleasant while charming my way into security rooms and looking at cameras.<br/><br/>It was slightly unsatisfying, though: I'm still trying to figure out why I enjoyed the Fear Itself illusionism, but less so the Aeternal Legends version. (Perhaps because I ran Fear Itself, but that wasn't quite it). <br/><br/>I needed to leave early to catch a train.

The game is optimized for rather different thins than the conventioneering one shot. For example, a big part of the game involves progressing along the Spheres and triggering that attention of Da'ath, but that's paced to the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100255/#Comment_100255" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T12:48:40+00:00" title="October  1, 2007 12:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2007 12:50PM by Graham.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a fair point.<br/><br/>The title of the thread isn't about a trainwreck, though, it's about a railroad.

One of the things I quite enjoyed seeing was when the two PCs used their powers in a complementary fashion to take the bad guy down. Aeternal Legends combat is partly based on resource allocation and the elf's Spere power allowed her to make defending expensive. She didn't always hit, but she did wear his active Defence down so that the dwarf PC had a perfect opportunity to use *his* power to bypass armour, leaving the bad guy without any way to resist the maul attack that took him down.<br/><br/>The wind mage also had a neat bit where he blew a ball of flaming pitch onto a group of subway pirates during a train vs. train chase scene, and summoned a nifty spirit to counter the summoner's pet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100276/#Comment_100276" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T13:47:09+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  1:47PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2007 1:48PM by Rich Stokes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>how easy is it to find stuff in the book?</blockquote>I haven't really had a chance to look at the book in any real depth.  Although what you're describing might be an artefact of the format.  It's a Lulu Landscape (9" by 7") book, the same size as Agon.  Possibly this means that something which in a standard format game would be on (say) three pages of text might end up being spread out over 5 or 6 of these smaller pages.<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, there's no index.

Stew's talk about the game promised a lot: Not anything you can't get in other games or anything unique, but some good meaty stuff.  The game book, (and I still haven't had time to read the bloomin' thing properly) also seems to have all the things a great game needs.  But the scenario was, well, <i>really generic</i> and pretty weak.  Which is a shame really.<br/><br/>Not that it was an unpleasant experience or terrible session, but really, it didn't do a good job of "selling" the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
