I haven't found anything for Bite Sized Actual play from this campaign, but I'm happy to talk about it.;<br/><br/>It started during one of my read throughs of FAE. I realized that Fate Accelerated practically stands up on a table and says, "Please use me to run Star Wars!" Because it seems like a super fit for the rules.<br/><br/>I discussed this with the organizer of my Tuesday night meetup, and he had an idea for doing a Star Wars campaign himself. We decided to join forces, and do a split campaign, where both halves would be related.<br/><br/>So, I led off. My campaign is set in between the trilogies. The other GM is playing one of the last survivors of a top-secret Republic attempt to create a unit of force-trained soldiers. (It didn't end well.) He's on the run from the Empire, which is gradually expanding into the Outer Rim. <br/><br/>I had a table rule that we had to have a droid, an alien, and a non-force using human as PCs; luckily that wasn't a problem and soon we had a database droid, the other GMs alien character, a roguish smuggler, his first mate, and a mercenary (we noticed the Firefly parallelism; it was enough that the first mate's player changed her PCs name to Zokaley, which is actually a good Star Wars name), and finally a bounty hunter and a Sith lord.<br/><br/>Yeah!<br/><br/>This was my first time running FAE for an extended period of time, but I was pretty happy with how easy it was to just have two black hat PCs--in fact, the campaign basically revolves around the Sith lord and his bounty hunter friend searching for the white hat PCs. <br/><br/>The other game is set just before the birth of Anakin, when some Jedi investigate the secret force-trained unit. In that one I play a mavericky Jedi Master and my padawan is played by the same player with the Sith lord PC--as you can guess, they're the same character. This has been kind of neat as well.<br/><br/>In terms of mechanics, we didn't do anything particularly radical. Force powers are handled by Aspects, enhanced with Stunts; this has worked pretty well so far, and keeps everyone around the same power level. (We discovered how tough combat Aspects can make a character when the bounty hunter nearly took out three white-hat PCs all by himself.) We haven't tried to define anything too much about Force powers, mostly letting it be Stunts like:<br/><br/>--Because I am a Sith Lord, I get +2 when dueling with Forcefully with a lightsaber<br/><br/>--Because I am a Telekinetic prodigy, I get +2 when Flashily creating an advantage with telekinesis<br/><br/>...but meanwhile letting the Aspects run things--like when my Jedi Master attempted to use the "old Jedi Mind trick." The bureaucrat PC proved remarkably strong-minded.<br/><br/>In short, it's worked pretty bloody well. Of course, it helps to make sure everyone is on the same page--Star Wars games need to have everyone comfortable with doing Star Wars-y stuff and not checking for traps every three meters. :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430679/#Comment_430679" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T05:54:45+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  5:54AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks good to me!
