The guide is aimed at the majority of those people who have an idea for an RPG but do not know where to start or start in a hot rush of enthusiasm only to never get it to a playable state.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guide is written more for traditional RPG formats rather than story games. I do love story games but the huge majority of free RPGs that land in my inbox are unfinished traditional RPGs, so I serve those first. I imagine that anyone attempting a story game mechanic won't need much newbie help on the mechanics as attempting one requires a fair amount of RPG savvy; but might find the rest useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I'd still very much like some feedback on the guide so that I can improve it. It's halfway through published (every Tuesday at Noon GMT) but there is plenty of meat to comment on. Thank you in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit - whoops!

In my experience, games that are 20 pages or less are the most likely to be picked up and implemented at the table, because folks can fit them in whenever they have a hole in their schedule, rather than having to devote many hours to familiarizing themselves and the other players to a new setting and system.  <br><br>My advice to people struggling with design is always to write a version that boils down the core gameplay to as few words and rules as they possibly can, in something like 5 pages.  Otherwise, it's very difficult for anybody else to understand what the game's about, what the players actually do, and so on. Also, shorter game texts are much MUCH easier for designers to finish as an alpha or beta draft, which gives them a sense of accomplishment and allows them to actually play their game before spending many months or years slaving away at it.<br/><br/>Also, a lot of the advice you're giving sounds more appropriate for developing a campaign -- creating factions, gods, NPCs, etc. -- rather than writing a stand-alone game. Shouldn't the designer be writing guidelines for other players to implement, in regards to those things, rather than doing all the work for them?<br/><br/>Just some initial thoughts.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353554/#Comment_353554" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T09:18:40+00:00" title="January  9, 2012  9:18AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>It is kind of you to make this effort, but I think it would be kinder to change the text of your article to "Don't."</p>\n<p>To expand that a little - free RPGs are a great way to kill a lot of your time and get no return out of it except for the logorrheic sense of release one gets when emptying the mental bowel.

I mostly disagree with Shreyas on this; free games are the best!  I think new designers often make a bigger mistake by assuming their first game has to be a commercial product, right from the get-go.  But it is important to think rationally about whether anybody else is really going to play your game, before you invest a ton of time in prepping it for any kind of release, including for free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353558/#Comment_353558" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T09:36:33+00:00" title="January  9, 2012  9:36AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Free games devalue everything that we (people who sell games for money) work for by releasing poor-quality product, diluting the market, and lowering pricing expectations.

Releasing stuff for free is a completely legitimate route to go, for any number of reasons, in the effort to compete for people's time and attention, or just because you can't be bothered with running a business or selling a particular product.

Walton</b><br/>\nI can't say what affect a fat setting has on the playability of a game. For most free RPGs, the distinction between them is narrow and comes down to a minor mechanic tweak. In most cases free mechanics-only RPGs do not get played because they offer very little that isn't available elsewhere (Fudge/Fate/Sketch/Five by Five/WR&amp;M;/etc). Instead, those that I read about getting actual play are those based on an interesting premise, such as "You're locked in a hotel" or "Escape an orphanage" etc. Without that setting (and I mean that in the broadest sense), the mechanics-only games have very little novelty.<br/>\n<br/>\nShort games are more likely to be picked up but large games are downloaded and played too, I know that from first-hand experience. I read an actual play from someone who campaigned with FEAR - which is a monolith 500 A4 pages of text! They are in the minority.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think an example campaign setting can only make your game more attractive as it is an example of the system and background's use. Where you draw the line between background and campaign is difficult, naturally. For fantasy games, you can reel back the campaign because most of the target audience can do that standing on their heads. In that case, it will be ignored. For modern/sci fi/random insane game then it may well be more difficult for the GM to dream up a campaign from the background and that's where an example one can be enough to make your game cross the boundary from lots of effort to playable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guide is in response to the games I read for review and feedback. Most begin with an interesting mechanic twist and some nice background ideas and then flounder - usually because the author ran out of steam. By providing lots of autocratic orders, it helps the author make progress - even if a lot of it is ignored!<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you find the Inspiration/Research/Writing chapters helpful?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><a href="/forums/profile/shreyas">@shreyas</a></b><br/>\nThanks for your input. Some of us like to create and then share for the love of it. A recursive niche, undoubtedly! For those that want help, at least they'll have somewhere to go. I'm going to avoid the argument on whether free RPGs are destroying the market because I have no statistics to prove or deny either way. I imagine you do not either, which means the argument will finish with a discussion of semantics, outside the original scope of this topic. Free RPGs have been published online since the early 90s, so I imagine the market affect (assuming they share the same market) has been constant in line with commercial RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><a href="/forums/profile/Emily">@Emily</a> Care</b><br/>\nThanks for the feedback, I'm glad I'm hitting the right spots. I'd not thought of the guide as a game but I do see where you're coming from. When I re-edit for the inevitable PDF, perhaps I should turn it into more of a game.

I've read some cool processes where games are created through playtesting but for the guide, I wanted to keep it simple so that new creators found it easy to follow.

What threshold do you need to pass? Do you need to win Game Chef, the Ronnies, or some other game design contest?

People buy products looking for inspiration for their own designs, or to expand their understand of the limit of design, or because they have a fanatical interest in RPGs that expresses itself both in RPG design and in scouring the internet for new, unique games.
