Keeping the "innocence" of the old-school, with the ability to create some in-depth characters without a whole lot of work. There would still need to be a great deal of crunch, mostly in providing a wide variety of spells for the magic-users, equipment, and magical items. I'd want each "class" to have a host of abilities the player could potentially choose from, that would make each character somewhat unique, but keeping them largely rules-lite and balanced, rather than everything being defined around combat. I'd want to avoid the feel that you had to "optimize" your characters for butt-kicking, and instead could focus on making the character something interesting and imaginative.<br/><br/>...and TONS of paper minis.

My (and Tony and Adam's) version of D&amp;D is <a href="http://www.latorra.org/dungeon-world/" rel="nofollow">Dungeon World</a>. Really, when I run 4E these days I find myself wishing I was playing the same game using the DW rules. I really feel like DW is what I'd do with D&amp;D. To whit:\n<ul>\n<li>Move the resolution granularity up from single attacks to broader actions (moves).</li>\n<li>Give the GM a strong framework to work in beyond "it's a series of rooms."</li>\n<li>Allow more improvisation, especially in fights. I should be able to make a fight on the fly, without hours of prep.</li>\n<li>Keep the fun of levelling up and picking new cool stuff. Keep the 4E ideal of every level giving a choice.</li>\n<li>Make the fiction matter more, make fictional action a part of mechanical action.</li>\n</ul>\nAlso make it as open and collaborative as possible. Maybe because game design isn't a job for me, I don't mind if other people can create content for my game.<br/><br/>Keep the ability to add new content (splat-book style stuff). Being able to write new classes, items, monsters, and GM moves is a great way to keep that same ongoing discovery feel that the constant stream of D&amp;D books produces.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308050/#Comment_308050" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T13:08:15+00:00" title="January 13, 2011  1:08PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I doubt I could do it better than this:<br/><a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/214420000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/214420000</a><br/><br/>From what I've heard, it's got campaign options now.

It was enough to suck me back in after 28 years of ignoring or dismissing D&amp;D. (Seriously, the last time I played was in high school in 1982.) Part of that was the nostalgia factor and the coolness of a cheap boxed set, but I was impressed at how well put together it is, with the CYOA format walking you through character creation and a solo encounter to get you started.<br/><br/>The Essentials books, also, are nicely done, with a less intimidating indie-game-like form factor, tons of eye-popping artwork, and very good layout and indexing.<br/><br/>I understand the point of some of the above comments, but I don't think it's realistic to turn D&amp;D into either a story-game, or a 1977-era "I hit the monster with my sword and take its gold" hack-fest. Both are valid play styles but they're not what D&amp;D is nowadays, as far as I can tell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308060/#Comment_308060" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T14:27:26+00:00" title="January 13, 2011  2:27PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's a really fun D&amp;D game hiding halfway between <i>Essentials</i> and <i>Wrath of Ashardalon</i>.

It's called Dungeonfuckers. It's Red Box D&amp;D as if by David Cronenberg.<br/><br/><b>The game I think would sell:</b><br/><br/>Tough call. I think nostalgia and "the D&amp;D way" are important to the game's success. To that end, I think something kind of baroque and arcane would be popular. No core system, strong class differentiation, unique rules for unusual situations, and strong support for the group to construct their own system in play would be key. You'd also need to keep the iconic six stats, most of the spells, and the d20 attack roll, I think, for it to "feel" like D&amp;D. Dungeon World achieves a lot of those things.<br/><br/><b>The game as I think it should be:</b><br/><br/>I think the strength of D&amp;D is in problem-solving. Obviously, people find different things fun about the game, and you can't please everybody, but I think that the problem solving aspect is what D&amp;D does better than many other games. It's fun to learn dungeoneering skills as a player (checking for traps, memorising the abilities of monsters, approaching situations cautiously, bringing the right equipment, finding novel solutions), and then use those skills in a way that other people can appreciate. The difficulty is making a game that supports this without relying on the GM to adjudicate the thing unsupported. I think the game would become a set of guidelines and tools for the GM to use to resolve complex situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308083/#Comment_308083" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T17:34:43+00:00" title="January 13, 2011  5:34PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is like asking me how would I re-spin my childhood.

The rules were incomplete and because of that we had to make our own up.  We filled in so many blanks it become Our Game.  It was only when every rule was cross-referenced and footnoted that D&amp;D lost most of what made it fun.  It's not just that the game has changed, but we have as well.  So, I am not sure you could recapture the innocence of the game we used to play.  <br/><br/>That being said, were I given D&amp;D as a brand to rerelease, I would redo the game as a sort of advanced Mad-Libs with a few rules to fill in blanks.  There would be a few examples, but mostly you'd have to come up with your own.  As you grow in level, there are more and more blanks until you are completely telling the story yourselves.  You would have a shared story and have come up with most of it without being told what to roll, what powers you can use, etc.  Pretty lame, I admit, but to appeal to more people (and kids, I think this is key for D&amp;D) you have to drop the idea that more skills, more weapons, more dice rolls, more rules make the game better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308104/#Comment_308104" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T20:39:14+00:00" title="January 13, 2011  8:39PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that kind of just occured to me is that nonweapon proficiencies, ala 2nd edition, are actually <i>really</i> similar to Apocalypse World-style moves.

Say D&amp;D to ten different people and you'll get ten different games.<br/><br/>Me, I would take the LBB/B/X books and put them in a proton collider together with the Essentials line. Forget everything that happened in between, go back to barebones D&amp;D, the sheer fundamentals of what makes it what it is, then update it with a more rationalized framework and upgrade the basic ideas with some sleeker resolution mechanics and then put some Moves/Powers sugar on top. <br/><br/>So a really lightweight, small tight ruleset for characters that leaves a lot to build upon. Then add subsystems/modules for three kinds of play: dungeoncrawling, sandbox hexcrawling, urban. Each subsystem would have a few rules and mechanics to support it but would mostly consist of frameworks and tools for the DM. It would be fairly easy to transition between them. I would fit all that into one book, a couple of hundred pages at the very most.<br/><br/>Then I would add a big monster book to that, and an "Advanced" book that would expand on the original game in different ways, mostly with worthwhile bits of crunch. And then a spinoff game that would be more of a mini tactics/boardgame thing and would use the same monster book, but with some different assumptions/extra rules.<br/><br/>Basically kinda what sage, John and Johnstone are saying, but with my own spin. On one hand a "basic" game that's more like oD&amp;D + Apocalypse World with a dash of Essentials, on the other hand a minis spinoff that's more Essentials + Chainmail + Wrath of Ashardalon/Castle Ravenloft. Then a Danger Patrol + Gamma World product that's related, but not really D&amp;D. It would be more card based. <br/><br/>All three games would be obviously related and have some overlap between them, enough that you could even, say, use a few cards from GW in D&amp;D or whatever, but they would be separate products (pure RP, minis/board, cards).<br/><br/>That said, I am in fact writing my D&amp;D heartbreaker. Everyone and their mothers is these days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308113/#Comment_308113" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T00:43:51+00:00" title="January 14, 2011 12:43AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd leave 4th edition/Essentials as is, but I would change the powers to have a more significant non-combat effect.

You point your finger, and your foe is scoured in hellish flames. Constitution vs. Reflex.

It loses about 10% of its mass each second.

I would go to considerable pains to do this anonymously, so that no one could tell which were "official".<br/>\n<br/>\nI would flood the interwebs with better-quality versions of everything that'd previously been released under the D&amp;D; brand, make it 100% open content using the OGL, and make these easy to find (text-only SRDs, etc.) for talmudic scholarship.

Yes, even in the case of mmorpgs: you can play them without the roleplaying element and keep a strictly metagame level (I used to play in a shard where nobody would ever take up his character's role), therefore there's no role play in them.<br/>I also disagree on the analisis that the videogame would be GMing for me. There are pre-constructed paths, dialogue lines. Also there is no participation in a shared imagined space. <br/>All elements that concur in wiping the "rpg" part out of the equation.<br/><br/>BUT, if you meant "as a brand", then... well my answer would still be true to the rpg form and I'd ask Luke Crane to do it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308150/#Comment_308150" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T06:56:30+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  6:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my opening post, I purposefully called it "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Game" to give as much flexibility to everyone's answers as possible.

Basically, evocative ideas that make players <i>want</i> to play in those worlds, as opposed to the generic fantasy settings that have all been done before. There's also mention of a fondness for the little throwaways bits of setting information scattered throughout the old rulebooks. This makes me think that a book containing the D&amp;D equivalent of Fiasco playsets or In a Wicked Age oracles could serve as a focal point for a new D&amp;D game: random generator for settings, monster names and descriptions, magical artifacts, NPC types, etc. The key is to provide information that evokes creativity from the players, rather than tell them everything about the world.<br/><br/>Combine that with a ruleset that allows for Step On Up play, along with some of my favourite narrative gamplay ideas (keys, character creation that starts with relationships, etc), and maybe this: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>I totally want to see Sandbox Hexcrawling as a game of its own.</blockquote>\nOh, and make it a box set: rulebook, playset book, hex tiles (both map scale and miniature scale), monster and adventurer tokens, dice, etc.<br/><br/>Hrm, I'm suddenly overcome with the urge to combine a set or two of Settlers of Catan with the WotC Monster Vault and dungeon tile sets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308171/#Comment_308171" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T08:59:19+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  8:59AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2011 9:24AM by Vernon R.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldnt.

PCs are adventurers who seek fame and fortune by getting rid of monsters plaguing the land.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Background-wise,</b> I wouldn't detail too much, only provides informations that ties the setting with the themes and rules and let each table add their own fluff as they go along. I'd take a hint from Earthdawn : the land was once ruled by this great civilization of magic, science and wonder but it's long gone and all that's left are ruins filled with ancient artefacts and monsters. It's a good excuse for roaming the land, getting into dungeons and smashing orcs heads.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Rule-Wise, </b> I'd keep the fighting mechanics at the core, but I'd streamline the hell out of what it has become. A fight with four PCs should last 15-20 min, tops. Another thing I'd keep are the Levels. The way you gain them would be streamlined too, but the goal of the game is to hoard gold and experience. I'd of course keep the Classes, maybe limit them to the Big Four with multiclassing for those who want something fancy (Cleric + Fighter = Paladin, for instance).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when you gain Levels, you gain <i>Power</i>, both magic, fighting and temporal. I really liked that you were supposed, back in the days, to get a shitload of followers. I'd device a simple system that would feel like you have 50-something underlings at level 12, something that would both feel like you're in charge without the hassle of really managing each one of them as it was done.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it's a matter of scale. As the game progress, the basics stay the same but the scope widens. You're always, at every level, exploring ruins, killing things and taking their stuff but at level 1, you're a band of rag-tag mercenaries lost in a corridor who honk on that ork's head with a big metal stick. At level 12, you besiege the whole ruin and fight an army of orcs with your own followers. At level 1 you gain a magic sword. At level 12 you gain a magitek ballista. At level 1 you steal a gem. At level 12 you steal a city.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd keep the thing uber-simple compared to modern incarnations of D&amp;D.; Something clear-cut, more complex than, say 3:16 but less than Reign. I'd keep the funky dice because it feels D&amp;D.; I'd try and make a simple way to prepare the game, up to the point of including rotating GM rules that shift the control form scene to scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Presentation-Wise,</b> I'd take a hint from the JRPG scene and include a big-ass Replay somewhere. Maybe I'd make a Replay comics instead, with each couple of pages explaining a topic of the game, which I'd put at the end of the corresponding chapter. And all that would fit in two or three booklets, with a combined page count of 90-120.<br/>\n<br/>\nMan, just talking about it makes me want to fire up my word processor...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308712/#Comment_308712" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T02:56:33+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  2:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a second thought, wait, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5576/dungeoneer-tomb-of-the-lich-lord" rel="nofollow">it has already been done...</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308724/#Comment_308724" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T05:19:22+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  5:19AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I finally have a thought on this.<br><br>Put out a new D+D and take it to the big shows - fer Christ's sake!<br><br>When they came out with 4e I didn't even know it had happened.

Monsters that have particular weaknesses, but aren't in some big list or book so everyone knows what they are.  Some method of creating them, and seeding the principles they work under in the nearby town as the party talks people up.<br><br>Some abstract rules for encumbrance.  Like a Move that deals with packing.  Like whenever you try to cart your stuff over long distances roll: a partial hit would be like choose something you had to leave behind.  A miss would be GM chooses what you left behind (later).<br><br>One thing I really liked about 2nd edition were all the kit multiclasses.  I want those without the splat bloat that comes from 3rd edition, and having to multiclass and have lots of books to build optimal characters.  So all the optional classes would be strictly worse than the main ones, but open up interesting character types.<br><br>Lots of modules that are on the level of Lady Blackbird that you can pick up and play, with maybe a little more for the GM to look at so he has the dungeon mostly done for him.  Package these as standalone products with all the rules to the game to sell individually, and maybe also as anthologies for people who have the game but just want the scenarios.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308818/#Comment_308818" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T21:10:20+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  9:10PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>When they came out with 4e I didn't even know it had happened.

Not that we had any WotC people there, at least not on an official basis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard" title="Anders Nygaard"><img alt="Anders Nygaard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/404/nXX62OQ3D3YOT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard">Anders Nygaard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308959/#Comment_308959" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T10:46:41+00:00" title="January 21, 2011 10:46AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tavis! Sorry; I do most of the posting at Imagonem these days, and I didn't think about the language thing at the time. It's basically a short note about all the inspiring ideas, and some chatter about yours, lessee...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Imagonem</cite>Complaints are being voiced over the direction taken by Dungeons &amp; Dragons, or, at any rate, over which direction the "brand" is taking. Or possibly over it's lack of direction. But haven't we already embarked on a somewhat crooked and unpleasant road when dedicated fans start to describe the game they love as a "brand"?<br><br>I'd rather do Story Games' twist on the discussion. Scre the traditional fannish wailing choir, and do something creative instead.<br><br>Tavis' idea has some merit, especially at the start, though we are also obliged to praise any plan involving faking your own death as a marketing ploy. There is something magical about the unique, the handmade, something that works well with classical role playing as I remember it in my most blurry moments of nostalgia. <br><br>As you shuffle trough the postapocalyptic wasteland of pop culture, grab what you can get your hands on. Bring a crowbar in case something is nailed down. Mix, remix and make your own games. Assemble them with scissors, glue, leather and stitches, with burned edges and whiskey stains. Share them. Make the sharing a game too. Weave your game into public spaces, private spaces, forgotten spaces, new spaces and waste spaces. Thou shalt gamify your life!</br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>How would
