And it just cost me \u20ac16,50, which is probably the most bang for bucks I got in a game since, dunno, Wild Talents EE.<br/><br/>Still, I have a couple of questions:</blockquote>\nShoot.\n<blockquote>1. On the Ganakagok page, I found these<a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/brochure/ganakagok-tarot-labels/425757" rel="nofollow">stickers</a>to enhance a regular card deck (Which is awesome), but I'm seriously considering the "proper" card deck on IPR, because they look very pretty in the book. How's the production quality on the deck? Normal cardboard or the awesome slidey plastic-y stuff they make playing cards out of? Do they last well?</blockquote>\nThe printer describes them as "near casino quality"; they feel like normal playing cards. I think they'll hold up like a normal deck; mine has been through two cons worth of play (a ton of demos!) and still looks good. I'm very happy with the quality.\n<blockquote>2. If I order the cards now (Sadly, my FLGS doesn't stock them, just the book.) it will probably take a while 'til I get them. Is there away to get/buy/beg a pdf of them so I could print/craft my own set until the real one crosses the atlantic?</blockquote>\nI have a pdf of the previous iteration of the cards; they're not as pretty, but whisper me and we'll talk.\n<blockquote>3. Any potential pitfalls, errata or "common houserules" that aren't in the book but could be usefull to know? So far, the text seems pretty tight and the rules well-designed (Though there are some errors now and then.), but, well, who knows. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nFor con play, there are some things I simplify, particularly with respect to the metaplot rules. Once around the table and then Morning (end-game) is one, which I streamline as a process by ignoring the rules for "bonus dice" from Sun and Stars mana and not bothering to roll for the GM. Another thing I did recently to make the game go faster was let players use Medicine cards to add Gifts in the middle of a turn rather than at the end; that turned out quite well. <br/><br/>Oh! One thing that's useful in a meta-gamey kind of way, I think, is for the first player turn to move pretty quickly to resolution. That is, after you figure out what the situation is, get the player's reaction and move right into the consequences rather than drawing out the build-up to the crux of the turn. Most of the role-playing in the game happens as players try to invoke their gifts to shift dice, and it's good for players to see that quickly in the first turn. By the same token, there's a temptation for players to say something like, "I use my..." to shift dice; encourage them to tell you what they do and then figure out how that works in their Gifts. Conversely, some players will want to describe what they do and not connect it to their Gifts. Be charitable with that: give them their "presence on the scene" shift and possibly their identity, if it's relevant. But absolutely encourage them to continue to roleplay their reactions, regardless of whether or not they get shifts out of it, because it helps develop the fiction.\n<blockquote>4. Rules question: When it's your turn to react, I'm guessing you can invoke only one [thing], ie. you can't invoke, dunno, both an Identity and a Gift, or two Gifts or whatever, although your invokation might get you multiple shifts. (With gifts of higher level or a Situation card with a high root value, for example.) Is that correct?</blockquote>\nNo. You can invoke as many Gifts as you like, so long as you can justify their invocation narratively. The GM will judge, and must be firm with himself (or herself) too. But you only get two opportunities at most to do so.\n<blockquote>-------------<br/><br/>There will probably be more to come as I continue to read it. (And the read it again.) But man, so cool so far...</blockquote>\nI'm very gratified that you like it. I can't even say.\n<blockquote>(Tomorrow is a small local con and I planned to haul my "Most Awesome Indie Games" there and set up a little "Hear Aaron talk endlessly about these weird games you never heard off" camp, but now I'm wondering whether I could/should/would run a game of Ganakagok there...)</blockquote>\nHow could you go wrong?

Matthjis has described something similar in one of his designs; I forget which. It's not a complete fix, but it ameliorates some of that sort of thing.\n<blockquote>Also, the GM didn't seem to stand a chance of winning, partly because players could narrate every single trait.

After that, if you get through the first turn in half an hour, then you can maybe get 20 minutes for each turn after that. At Gencon, I ran three players through a complete in game in just a hair over two hours. So if you have a four-hour slot, plan on an hour and a half for world &amp; character creation, an hour and a half's worth of player turns, 15-30 minutes for the end game, and the rest of the time for breaks, downtime, and slack.\n<blockquote>Also, by "Not rolling for the GM", do you mean that, as a GM, you don't pull Bad Medicine as sixes?

I think I got it, but, well...)</blockquote>\nIf it's too confusing as written, do it this way: either the GM or the active player will react first, depending on who <i>lost</i> intermediate narration. Then play goes around the table and the person who won intermediate narration gets to react <i>last</i>. This mostly preserves the intent of the original rule, and is easier to remember. The way the rule is written is "fairer" in the sense that the active player should respond first to whatever the GM does (whether that's narration or reaction), but sometimes it's just too hard to remember to do it that way in the heat of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
