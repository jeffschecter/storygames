I was looking at my blog statistics for referrals to my site and I noticed that quite a few hits were coming from what appears to be a Norwegian forum <a href="http://forum.n4f.no/showthread.php?t=11445" rel="nofollow">here</a>. After dropping some stuff into a translator, it would appear they are trying to start up contest to make something similar to <a href="http://sentientgames.wordpress.com/i-am-a-survivor/" rel="nofollow">IAAS</a>. Can anyone that speaks the language clarify for me? Just curious what people on the other side of the world are saying about it.

I like your mix of <i>Lady Blackbird</i> and <i>3:16</i>. And I really like the fact that you have been so effective in presenting the premise and the rules of the game.<br/><br/>The read planted a small idea in me; to have a competition in game-design, with the rule that all games must be presented within a single sheet of paper (both sides). So I pointed to your game, as a great example of how this may be done.<br/><br/>Part of the idea is to get together too, when the games has been made, to play them, discuss them, and vote over which game is best. So the competition will lead up to a gathering of Norwegian game-smiths, where we will sit face to face and talk design and play. I hope that will give a certain extra quality to the competition, for all participants.<br/><br/>It seems like the mood is all positive for this competition, so I reckon we will organize it this autumn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380873/#Comment_380873" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-05T14:32:49+00:00" title="June  5, 2012  2:32PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2012 2:37PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, awesome Tomas! I'd love to see what you guys can come up with. Can you do me the favor of linking the results when you guys are done? It's interesting that you mentioned 3:16 as I've never played or read the rules for that game. I'll have to find a copy to see what you're referring to. My inspirations were definitely Lady Blackbird, Mouse Guard, and The Dead. Not sure if The Dead is based off of 3:16.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_380891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380891/#Comment_380891" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-05T16:15:53+00:00" title="June  5, 2012  4:15PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2012 4:16PM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, my wrong; meant to say <i>Blackbird</i> and <i>Mouse Guard</i>.
