A good reminder that it's all relative!<br/><br/>I like Mercer's general statements about roleplaying and flexibility, but I'm skeptical that they can be translated to realistic Techniques at the table. <br/><br/>I don't know if it's the case here (with Mercer), but, in my experience, it's so common for GMs describing what they do to go to generalizations and vague philosophical statements when they are immersed (even if lightly) in the GM Mystery Cult. This means that we can talk about "getting the players on the hook", but not reveal or discuss actual, specific ways of doing so.<br/><br/>For many GMs in that mindset (again, I don't know if this applies to Mercer, but it's something I've seen a lot), talking in generalities is a convenient way to mask the techniques they actually use (likely because they realize, even at a subconscious level, that the techniques are self-contradictory or involve lying to the players).<br/><br/>I like the analogy of the adventuring party as a family; I think that often becomes the case in long-running games, and Mercer and his crew do that really well. I'll have to keep an eye open if I ever watch the games again, to see what kinds of things they actually do to make that happen and reinforce it (or if they started with that mindset in the first place, so strongly that it just became the mold for their game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
