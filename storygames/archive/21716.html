Most of the design has come along nicely, but I\u2019ve run aground on how to handle PCs running away from a threat. I\u2019ve written and playtested many options, but they\u2019ve all fallen flat one way or another. Any thoughts from all of you would be very much appreciated!<br/><br/>Ideally I\u2019d like for such a scene to emulate chases in horror films\u2014the protagonist runs here, runs there, hides in a closet, gets found, runs again, trips over something, sprains an ankle (of course), risks trying to temporarily disable the threat (e.g., with an improvised hairspray blowtorch), and finally gets away.<br/><br/>Assuming <i>Apocalypse World</i> as our baseline PbtA ruleset, how does the MC determine when the PC has escaped? What\u2019s the timer? If there\u2019s a countdown clock, what actions by the PC translate to ticks on the clock? If multiple PCs are trying to escape, or PCs and NPCs, how does that change the equation? What if they run away <i>en masse </i>versus breaking into groups? What if the escapees need to get to a safe place that\u2019s far away versus just getting out of the house? <br/><br/>The easiest solution is a move like: on a 10+, you escape; on a 7\u20139, you escape with complications; and on a miss, you\u2019re caught with no chance of escaping again. This is simple and direct, and it\u2019s my fallback if nothing else works, but it\u2019s too abrupt and not really what I want for this genre.<br/><br/>Have you MC\u2019d a chase/escape scene like this or designed a ruleset to handle it? What works and what doesn\u2019t?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475038/#Comment_475038" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-27T19:03:31+00:00" title="June 27, 2018  7:03PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you familiar with the countdown clocks of Blades in the Dark?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/onrigato" title="onrigato"><img alt="onrigato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/onrigato">onrigato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475040/#Comment_475040" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-27T19:21:03+00:00" title="June 27, 2018  7:21PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am, but <i>AW </i>doesn't have effect levels. I did fiddle around with ticking a countdown clock on hit results, with maybe 4 hits needed to escape. The issue is that there's a stat (Shadow) for surviving by avoiding threats, including by running away. However, allowing any hit to count as a tick toward escaping means that high Shadow characters are no longer better at escaping than other characters. A countdown clock seems like a good solution, but I haven't found an arrangement that quite works.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475048/#Comment_475048" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-27T20:30:08+00:00" title="June 27, 2018  8:30PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And if you think about it like 'harm'?

(There are very similar, but slightly less developed, mini-games for chases in <i>Firebrands</i> and <i>The King is Dead</i>.)<br/><br/>Finally, for a really "zoomed-in" version, you might look at <i>Murderous Ghosts</i>, which is, in many ways, one long chase/escape sequence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/onrigato" title="onrigato"><img alt="onrigato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/onrigato">onrigato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475082/#Comment_475082" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-29T13:26:32+00:00" title="June 29, 2018  1:26PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>, thanks for clarifying how you ran your game. With maps and movement rates, it's much easier to determine when the PCs have escaped. Games that are more fiction-based seem more slippery for determining that endpoint in a way that isn't just GM fiat. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, thanks for your suggestions. My game started out based on <i>AW</i>, and overall the ruleset is working great, but chases have been a total bugger to nail down. The issue is the combination of fiction first in PbtA and the fact that the MC has a lot of leeway when making MC moves. So, how to determine (1) what actions might allow the PCs to escape, and (2) how to determine when the PCs have actually escaped? As you suggest, the answer is probably far afield from <i>AW</i> itself, but I haven't gotten there yet. <br/><br/>If anyone is willing to share an example of an extended chase sequence from a PbtA actual play, that would be fantastically helpful. (Though in the horror genre, ambushing your pursuer is risky at best.)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475089/#Comment_475089" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-29T15:49:14+00:00" title="June 29, 2018  3:49PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/onrigato" rel="nofollow">onrigato</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So, how to determine [...] when the PCs have actually escaped?</p></div></blockquote>\nWhat about multiple objectives? A move to last-ditch escape, rolling +prep, and plenty of things they can do to prep (and complicate things on &lt;10). So leave the one-roll option, but suggest that things like distractions might help, then those are 6- oh no, 7-9 +1 prep but something's gone wrong, 10+ yay +1 prep?

In the AP framework players can also suggest objectives like "find the keys" which, if completed, would give bonuses toward completing "escape the horror".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/onrigato" title="onrigato"><img alt="onrigato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/onrigato">onrigato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475173/#Comment_475173" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-03T01:01:21+00:00" title="July  3, 2018  1:01AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2018 6:07PM by onrigato.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I wanted to thank everyone again for your responses and suggestions.

In the playtest, the PCs had to (1) make it out of the vampire nightclub, (2) run to their car, which was parked several blocks away, and (3) drive to their safe house.

On a 7\u20139, the person who rolled gets to choose whether to pay now or pay later. <br/><br/>I've resisted this option because PCs with a high Shadow stat will operate with less Nerve than other PCs if there's lot of group fleeing going on.

Heres what I said in an RPG I wrote:<br/><br/>CHASES &amp; COMPETITIONS:<br/>Chases and dynamic competitions are similar in the way they break down. One side is will generally be intrinsically faster, more powerful or simply better than the other. They might have a faster car, for instance, and everything else being equal they will inevitably pull away and win the race.<br/><br/>So the onus is on the \u2018losing\u2019 side to make sure things do not remain equal \u2013 by raising the stakes, doing something radical, generally changing up the situation in such a way as to manufacture a temporary advantage. <br/><br/>Example: A fleet-footed urchin has cut the purse from the belt of a grizzled crusader and is sprinting away through the crowd. Unless the crusader does something radical, the boy will quickly be lost to sight. Lumbering after him, pushing people left and right, the crusader grabs an apple from a stall as he passes and hefts it with the intent to startle a horse and cart in front of the boy, hoping to slow him momentarily and allow him time to make ground.  Thus rather than using his speed, he is changed the situation in such a way as to make use of his martial prowess.  <br/><br/>So each turn one side gets a chance to do something,  Make it a 'best of 6' contest where each side gets 3 turns, and add up the result.  If they like, each side can go with their intrinsic ability at the contest and see if they can get lucky, but the interesting part is actually seeing if you can imagine a way to employ a superior ability by changing up the rules of the contest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
