It is that your character must be personally, emotionally involved in what's going on.</blockquote>\nNote what it says, and what it doesn't say.<br/><br/>It says <i>your character</i> must be personally, emotionally involved.<br/><br/>It does not say anything about <i>the player</i> needing to be personally, emotionally involved.<br/><br/><br/>In the general case, I think this is absolutely the right way to approach RPG rules.  Make rules about what the characters must do or must feel.  Eschew rules about what the players must do or must feel.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135055/#Comment_135055" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T16:02:29+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  4:02PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I don't know about.  The text in the Sorcerer book I was talking about does indeed talk about the players finding reasons for their character's to be involved and retro-fitting their character concept as needed.  However, I personally find it very difficult to do that, if I myself am not personally invested in some manner, even if that investment is different from that of my character.<br/><br/>Also, I suggest taking a look at the Handbook section of the game Dirty Secrets.  That stuff in there is very much about what the players need to be doing to make the game work.  The one bit I hone in on is that he players need to have a personal working theory of the case at all times and play the various Characters with that theory in mind.  If they don't do that, the game won't work.  It's very easy to think that just sitting back and applying the rules will magically lead to surprise ending.  They won't.  They will, however, if you play from that "working theory" point of view.<br/><br/>Spione works on a similar principle.  If the players don't understand what The Cold is and how Maneuvers are meant to "spiral" in on The Cold then the game won't work.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135056/#Comment_135056" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T16:07:46+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  4:07PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2008 4:08PM by Per_Fischer.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger, I disagree very much, and I think you are wrong.<br/><br/>If the players are not invested in what's going on, it's going to fall flat. I've tried it several times. There also are nothing the characters "must do or feel", that's always a decision you have to make as a player.<br/><br/>Let me try to explain why I think you are wrong. Playing Sorcerer is a constant challenge to you as a player, and the courtesy you have to show is conducting your character in such a way that it addresses your own emotional involvement. Read a bit further in that paragraph you are quoting from. Your character should care, but it is you, as a player, who makes the decisions, who directs the character.<br/><br/>"Look at the Kicker, there on the sheet. You and the GM have agreed that it is a priority for your character to exert effort to cope with it, and that it means it should be a priority for you, as a player, to direct the character appropriately."<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't have a clue how to play a character and not being personally emotionally involved. Nor would it be of any interest to me.<br/><br/>EDIT: Cross-posted with Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135057/#Comment_135057" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T16:12:29+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  4:12PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should add that there's a bit of jargon for this I came up with.

Ever played a board game where three out of four people are pouring their heart and soul into winning the game but the fourth is just kind of taking their turn without really trying to be competitive?  Even though the fourth player may not be doing anything disruptive they can really fuck up the game because their behavior isn't on the level of the other three.  Or maybe you've played a board game with one of those parents who deliberately makes poor game choices to help out "the kids."<br/><br/>I've had this happen to me.  A friend invites me to go "bowling" and I happen to really like bowling.  I show up all ready to bowl.  But what I find upon arrival is half the group hanging out at the bar and the other half kind of half-heartily tossing the ball on their turn.  At that point we aren't "bowling", we're having a party in a bowling alley.  Which is cool but can be a let down if you didn't show up with the right Social Mandate in mind.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135061/#Comment_135061" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T17:05:09+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  5:05PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an enthusiastic response, which is great!  It leads me to think that, yes, this is a widely-misunderstood rule.<br/><br/>First of all, let me try to clear up some things.  All I did was quote from the <i>Sorcerer</i> rulebook.  That's all.  I'm not personally trying to advance the position that this particular rule is correct, or incorrect, or applicable or inapplicable, or helpful or not helpful.  All I am saying is:  look, there it is.<br/><br/>So responses like "I don't agree with you, Roger!" leave me a bit baffled.  What, you don't agree that those are the words on page 74 of the <i>Sorcerer</i> book?  I guess you can disagree with me on that if you like, but I'm not liable to be particularly swayed, if you can see my position.<br/><br/>If you disagree with that rule, hey, that's fine, but I can't really help you myself.  You're disagreeing with the author of <i>Sorcerer</i>.  Try taking it up with him.<br/><br/>On a related note, references to games other than <i>Sorcerer</i> don't seem to be especially relevant.  References to games also written by Ron Edwards are perhaps somewhat more relevant, but really, I think we have quite enough to talk about with just <i>Sorcerer</i>.<br/><br/>There has been some observations along the lines of "Having a character who is personally, emotionally involved with what is going on, without being myself, as a player, being personally, emotionally involved, is very difficult!" Well... yes.  A lot of what Sorcerer asks from a player is difficult.  And I'm not trying to put forth the position that the rules suggest or require the player <i>not</i> to be personally, emotionally involved.  I'm merely pointing out what the rules themselves have to say on the subject.<br/><br/>I reject outright any suggestion that I quoted the rules out of context, or that there is anything further in the paragraph which implies, ha ha, just kidding, actually the player needs to be personally, emotionally involved as well.  I'll post the whole section if you like; it is, without exception, entirely directed towards what the character should do and feel, with nothing at all about the player.\n<blockquote>And there you have it. How To Play Sorcerer. All spelled out, if you read it literally and check your play history at the door.</blockquote>\nThat is, I believe, all I have done here.  Read literally, and checked my play history at the door.  If others insist on dragging their play history along with them as some sort of anecdotal illustration, well, I'll try to deal with that as best I can.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135062/#Comment_135062" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T17:12:35+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  5:12PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to agree with Per and Jesse. If narrativism is about exploring issues, then the player (and naturally by extension, the character) has to be emotionally involved in the outcome, at least to some degree. That's what gives Sorcerer an edge that a lot of "personal horror" games lack: it explicitly functions only when the players are involved. Their characters are only extensions, avatars of whatever issue the player is exploring in game. <br/><br/>This is why Ron, I believe, explicitly cuts out direct mind control in Sorcerer: it cuts the player away from the character. Suddenly, the game has gone from Story Now to being a shared hallucination. And doing so risks making it difficult for the player to reconnect with the character, and use it to explore those issues. The character becomes "damaged goods." <br/><br/>Only in a Simulationist sense can we talk about  the character "being emotionally invested" in the outcome. Under those premises, the character is a (mostly) complete separation from the player. And even then it doesn't work well: consider how many times we see players willing to die before they lose control of their character. And why? Because a big appeal for people who game is to treat this fictional block of stats like it's an extension of themselves. But that only goes so far, and then stops. So, it's not really rational to talk about "character investment" when it's the player who has to invest emotion in the outcomes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135063/#Comment_135063" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T17:34:15+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  5:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2008 5:36PM by Alan.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger, the one sentence you quote is out of context. When you said "It does not say anything about the player needing to be personally, emotionally involved" this implies to me (and others I think) that you think Ron is saying that the player need not care. <br/><br/>In fact Ron does _not_ write this, and Ron is famous for being surprised when people think he meant something he did not write. He relies a lot on saying something once and letting the reader understand through context. The rest of the book assumes that the player must care about the fiction and so, to his mind anyway, that applies here unless he says otherwise.<br/><br/>What is radical about that paragraph on p74, is that it says "...assume that the character does care and work backwards from there..." That is a reversal of the common style of play that expects the GM to put out hooks that the character's care about. In Sorcerer, it's the players responsibility to create the hooks themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135064/#Comment_135064" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T18:01:03+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  6:01PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since Ron talks about courtesy, I wonder if it's just a politeness thing.

I diagreed with that this is the most misunderstood rule in Sorcerer, and that you took the quote for saying: "It says your character must be personally, emotionally involved. It does not say anything about the player needing to be personally, emotionally involved." <br/><br/>Only a few lines later in the book Ron qualifies what the quote implies, I don't think it's that hard to understand at all. The players' interest and engagement is implied - and necessary. There are many other things in the book I find much harder to get and especially remember when actually playing.<br/><br/>Come to think of it: why do think this (the player has to be emotionally involved in the game's issues) is the most widely misunderstood rule in Sorcerer? Have you got links to discussions where that is apparent, or some play experiences perhaps?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135091/#Comment_135091" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T09:41:50+00:00" title="March 16, 2008  9:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: spookyfanboy</cite>I have to agree with Per and Jesse.

It is that your character must be personally, emotionally involved in what's going on.</blockquote>\nThese are sentences that I believe do not occur in the Sorcerer text:\n<blockquote>Players must be personally, emotionally involved in what's going on.<br/>Players must not be personally, emotionally involved in what's going on.</blockquote>\nIf I have implied that Sorcerer contained either of the above sentences, I apologize -- this was not my intention.  I'll suggest, once again, that the text is entirely silent on the matter.<br/><br/>Several people have stated that I've taken this out of context, which I don't think I have, but just to clear up any confusion, here's the section in its entirety:\n<blockquote><b>The players</b><br/>The big issue for the Sorcerer player is strictly a courtesy standard. It is that your character must be personally, emotionally involved in what's going on.  Players of role-playing games often complain that their characters have no reason to stick around and help one another.  To the best of your ability, avoid this problem by assuming that your character does care, and work backwards from there to give him or her a reason.  Look at the Kicker, there on your sheet.  You and your GM have agreed that it is a priority for your character to exert effort to cope with it, and that means it should be a priority for you, as a player, to direct the character appropriately.  Or if the Kicker is not immediately applicable, come up with a liking or a disliking for one of the other characters, and resolve to stick around until you can act on it.  This is not to say, of course, that your character must always care -- but the default should be that he or she does.</blockquote>\nThat's it -- the entire context.  Reading as charitably as I possibly can, I don't see anything in there which states or implies anything about the emotional involvement of the player.<br/><br/>So -- where does that leave us?  Well, to start with, it leaves us again with the text of the book.  As much as I like discussing other roleplaying games, the roleplaying experience as a whole, the human experience as a whole, and bowling, I'd like to at least try to keep things focused on the topic at hand.<br/><br/>Is it plausible that the author would simply omit, or leave to inference, a rule about player involvement, if such a thing were so fundamental and necessary to the play experience?  It's possible, sure.  It doesn't seem particularly plausible to me, is all.<br/><br/>The players of Sorcerer include some of the most imaginative, creative, and innovative people around.  They can pretend to be wizards, demons, murderers, and thieves without themselves being any of those things.  It seems bizarre to me to suggest that, for some reason, they are incapable of pretending to be a character who is personally, emotionally involved without themselves being personally, emotionally involved.  Give the players some credit.  They are capable of creating good stories that they are proud of.<br/><br/>So... is this, in fact, THE most understood rule?  No, probably not -- I think hyperbole got the better of me.  Let's just say it's among the misunderstood rules of Sorcerer -- as evinced, I would suggest, by this very thread.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135096/#Comment_135096" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T09:50:31+00:00" title="March 16, 2008  9:50AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you should start your own thread if you want to discuss that somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135100/#Comment_135100" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T11:09:17+00:00" title="March 16, 2008 11:09AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Sounds like you should start your own thread if you want to discuss that somewhere.</blockquote>\nAre you referring to JD's statement?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135107/#Comment_135107" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T12:27:53+00:00" title="March 16, 2008 12:27PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Denys</cite><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Sounds like you should start your own thread if you want to discuss that somewhere.</blockquote>\nAre you referring to JD's statement?<br/><br/>Yes.

I know that I, personally, have to be involved in a story if I'm going to be creative. I need to be fully engaged and interested or it will be flat. I'm not suggesting that if my PC is angry, that I have to be angry, quite the contrary. I would not find that kind of thing very healthy. I roleplay my PCs being angry at my friends' PCs quite a bit, but if we were truly angry about the conflict at hand, we couldn't high five each other afterwards and talk about how great the session went.<br/><br/>That being said, I think the text does talk about player involvement as important in several places. Such as:\n<blockquote><br/>A Sorcerer story is extremely effective when the <i>players</i> care about the consequences of their actions upon normal people. A GM should present meaningful non-sorcerer characters and encourage the player-characters to act toward their benefit.

That is, in fact, the definition of a rule. Players don't have to play by the rules, of course, they can and will modify them to suit.

I'm not sure what I was thinking there.  I'm inclined to think that rules are most useful when they talk about what players should or must do in-game, which is to say generally through the avenue of their characters, in contrast to rules about the meta-game or out-of-game concerns.  But it's not as clear-cut as I first thought, I think.<br/><br/>In general:<br/><br/>I've found this thread a bit frustrating, and it took me a little while to figure out just what it was.<br/><br/>Basically, I wanted to talk about the text of Sorcerer.  What I found was that I was largely alone in that.  People would rather talk about other rpgs, or rpgs in general, or their experiences with Sorcerer or other rpgs, or actual play, or other topics.<br/><br/>Which is fine, in its way.  Those are all topics worthy of discussion.  They just weren't the things I wanted to talk about in this thread.<br/><br/>In retrospect I really failed to communicate that topic clearly.  It also didn't help that I categorized this as "Play Advice" when it seems clear now that I was not offering nor seeking any advice on play.  So I apologize for misleading anyone.<br/><br/><br/>If anyone wants to 'take over' the thread, feel free; if you'd rather start up explicit threads on some of the worthy topics raised here, and just let this one die of natural causes, that's fine too.

To the point of sometimes being bored with the exercise. I remember one case about a year ago when the GM said after the scene something like "wow, you must of REALLY been in character that last scene" and I responded "no way, I was completely utterly disconnected from the character and didn't care." Speaking loosely, it's called "acting" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nSo is that what the rule says? Even if you as a player don't care, when portraying the character make it seem like the character at least cares?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135281/#Comment_135281" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T17:42:54+00:00" title="March 17, 2008  5:42PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Sorcerer's not really good for that a, b, c type of play you mention, William.

You're not really 'portraying" a character like you would do when acting, but damn if I have the language at hand to describe why not.

Basically you've taken one small passage, out of context, and claimed that a literal reading of it in that light conveys a particular meaninig. And we're simply saying that it only does so if you pull it out and look at it like you have. Call it Ron's fault, if you must, but you're not getting out of the text what he has intended, nor what others have gotten by reading the same words. <br/>\n<br/>\nText is a really complex thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the other comments are simply saying, "And here's why Ron probably wouldn't intend to convey what you think he's conveying." So you can see our perspective on the reading. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the thread has stayed quite on topic. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135369/#Comment_135369" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T09:23:42+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  9:23AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Roger if you look at the next sentence on page 74 you can see what issue Ron is addressing:<br/><br/>Players of role-playing games often complain that their characters have no reason to stick around and help one another...avoid this problem by assuming that your character does care, and work backwards from there to<i>give him a reason.</i>(emphasis mine)</blockquote>The quote says nothing about the players being interested because the palyers' interest is assumed.<br/>The character's interest is assumed in that rule quote, not the player's.<br/><br/>Roger, is the point you're getting at that while rules can tell players what to do, they can't realistically make players <i>care</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135459/#Comment_135459" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T19:01:28+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  7:01PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quintin.

I've seen many dysfunctional groups with characters that have different agendas and no reason to be together. Its a powerful approach to say whatever you character concept, engagement with the group and its agenda is a fact.
