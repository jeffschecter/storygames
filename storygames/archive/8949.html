It confirmed something I'd been thinking about for a long time, that I've changed as a GM. I recently tried to run Mouse Guard and had it reconfirmed for me.<br/><br/>I can't be the guy who is responsible for saying what's next all the time. When I'm <i>one</i> of the people who gets to do that, I'm super-excited and contributing lots of cool shit.  But when I'm in a situation where I am always the one people are looking to for "what's next," I get drained.<br/><br/>Thank god for <a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/games.html" rel="nofollow">Primetime Adventures</a>. I had run a bunch of games as a GM--including my own--and wasn't having any fun but whenever I ran PTA I enjoyed myself immensely. PTA was like my touchstone to go back and back and back to and wonder "Why do I like this and not anything else?" It showed me how to make my game the kind of game I will enjoy GMing, for which I am deeply grateful.<br/><br/>I finally figured it out. PTA <i>requires</i>, by the rules, that the other players participate in saying what's next. There's a world of difference between "people ought to participate" and "it's your turn to say something." In the latter case, occasionally, if I'm gifted with players who will support me, I have fun. In the former, I always have fun.<br/><br/>GMless games are good for this, too, but I should note that I actually prefer games where there's a GM in this PTA style. I love taking a seed from people and expanding it into a scene. I love cutting between people, picking moments of high tension and zigzagging. It's electrifying.<br/><br/>I'm enjoying GMing again in ways I haven't for a long time, because I know what I want. This is exhilarating.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197611/#Comment_197611" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T12:01:17+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 12:01PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is exactly my experience with IAWA.  <br/><br/>I start about half of the scenes by looking at a player and saying a variation on "What are you doing right now?"

I also think, however, that it sometimes works to be explicit about the kind of GM you want to be, as long as they players are willing to step up and totally help you out in this capacity.  Different players and different games can be more or less supportive in this regard.  For example, I'm currently running Mouse Guard, which is more GM-oriented than most of the games I've played recently, but there are a few players in my current group who will step up and make stuff happen even if I drop back. There are also a few other players who are more reactive, looking to me or the other players for stuff to do or just sitting back and stepping in once something's happening.  It can be tricky keeping everyone engaged all the time, then, but it definitely helps me that not everyone is sitting back or looking for direction.<br/><br/>Back when I was running Bliss Stage, though, I stepped up very infrequently as the GM.  Most of the time, I just dropped in an image or situation every once in a while and the players ran with it, even running most of the missions largely themselves.  This was really cool, though I felt much more like a facilitator and less like an active participant in the game sometimes. Which is all to say, PTA is great and I'm glad that you have fun being a producer, but I'd like to think that what you want from GMing can also happen in other situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197615/#Comment_197615" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T12:12:14+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 12:12PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like being able to ping the players for scene options, too.

You know, the part of you that says "Oooh, I wonder what will happen if A finds out B's secret", and you just go with it. And I think games like PTA and IAWA free us to pick up those scenes without fear of wrecking "the story".<br/><br/>Good stuff, and the kind of GMing I like to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197633/#Comment_197633" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T12:58:48+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 12:58PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan: It's certainly <i>possible</i> in games without structures like PTA's, but it's possible the way lots of things are in trad games: because the players have informally chosen to do so.

We all know it requires more and different input from the players, and on paper it seems straightforward enough. What I've noticed is the KIND of input isn't like being a "mini-GM" and isn't like being an inordinately proactive player, it's very important not just to state facts (like a traditional GM) or posit reactions, but to state facts <i>that other players can build on.</i> <br/><br/>This may seem simple to a lot of people here, but that middle ground is not much seen in traditional games. Once this skill is mastered, Rob's preferred style of GMing can really flourish. When I play a lot of these games with traditional gamers, it's not usually old biases or bad habits that cause the game to fall flat, it's their inability to build a story from all directions (player &gt; Player and GM &gt; Player), and not for lack of trying. Once that's mastered, it's awesome to see the energy at the table skyrocket.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197684/#Comment_197684" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T17:37:52+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  5:37PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this.

I mean, in a unipolar game, the players often have currency or culture that allows them to create a lot of detail. Also, frequently in unipolar games the players are <i>free</i> to inject material, often even to frame scenes. <br/><br/>Systematizing that and especially confining it to the beginning of the scene but empowering the GM to take it from there produces a different kind of play which is I think orthogonal to the "my eyes communicate to you" vs. "we're all imagining together" dichotomy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197789/#Comment_197789" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T09:34:57+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  9:34AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think trying to cleanly divide these into a pair is misguided.

I have expectations based on past experiences that I'll be psychologically exhausted by having to constantly come up with stuff, and feel at some point in the game like a douchebag for being tapped out of ideas. I will feel guilty that I"m not pushing the game forward. Feel like a "bad" GM.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say the system doesn't give me enough to build off of, though if there were some way to randomly generate scene material without it sucking that might be interesting. However, I do like it when the game requires all-player scene authoring. Bolting it on during play can a) fuck with people's expectations in an unpleasant way and b) result in something that, because it's bolted on, is unaerodynamic and sucks.<br/><br/>But you're right. It's <i>entirely</i> about being relieved of that pressure. It's an enormous pressure I no longer enjoy. I think a lot of myself, but I also know there are limits to my creativity and that the game is going to be better if everyone is participating in making it so.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Fear of the GM having anything useful at all to do?</blockquote>\nWell, keep in mind that in a game like PTA, the GM still has plenty to do. The players don't narrate out an entire scene, they just say in a sentence fragment ("This is the scene where...."), and the GM in PTA has decisions to make about budget-spending and possibly narration. You can use this multipolar technique and still have plenty for the GM to do. (Also, note that the GM <i>also</i> is one of the people who frames scenes.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Fear of players having scene framing power?</blockquote>\nI certainly don't feel that myself, but it may be why people could be resistant to it. The only objection I've heard to this style was from Brandon on the Walking Eye review and interview episodes for Misspent Youth. I think he felt that the GM didn't have enough to do. I disagreed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197905/#Comment_197905" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T16:51:32+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  4:51PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think another aspect of this (certainly for me, if not for Rob) is wanting to see everyone contribute their creative vision to the game.

Are we talking about simply having pro-active players or are we actually talking about the scene framing architecture of Primetime Adventures.  I ask because there's a difference between how things are done in games like My Life with Master, Sorcerer and In A Wicked Age, vs. how things are done in Primetime Adventures, Capes and The Shab-al-Hiri Roach.<br/><br/>In the first three games the GM retains total editorial power over scene framing.  Players can *request* scenes either explicitly (I want a scene where Jon and I are talking) or  implicitly (I'm going to go kill that bastard Robin).  Without proactive players (through their character's declared actions) the games don't work but the GM still retains full editorial power over scenes.  In other words the GM is free to say, "While you're waiting for Jon to arrive your mom calls you" or "On your way to kill Robin ninjas attack you."<br/><br/>That's NOT true in the other three.  There either is no GM at all and players must frame their own scenes or, in the case of Primetime Adventures, the GM MUST abide by the player's request after they set Focus, Agenda and Location (although he can "spike" the scene if he wants to).  In other words the best the GM can do is say, "While you and Jon are talking your mom calls" or "In the middle of your duel with Robin, ninjas attack."<br/><br/>That's why I actually DON"T like PtA's formalized structure because 98% of the time I'm fine with whatever the player says but 2% of the time I want to "insert" something or "spike" or "spin" the situation to help lend a certain focus and I can't do that effectively in PtA.  As such I much prefer the "respectful editor" role of Sorcerer or In A Wicked Age...<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197927/#Comment_197927" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T17:32:31+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  5:32PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite>I think another aspect of this (certainly for me, if not for Rob) is wanting to see everyone contribute their creative vision to the game.

Or rather, anything where you're like "This is what's the deal for this scene."<br/><br/>I've never experienced the kind of creative blocking you talk about in the latter part of your post.
