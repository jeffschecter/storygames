Part of the game is approx 20 double-sided dungeon tiles, each 6 inches square. Of the print-on-demand-ish places that I know, none of them can do this affordably.  I'll also need game boxes large enough to accomodate an 8.5x11 book.  Does anyone know of places that can print these affordably in a short print run?  If I get a larger print run, there are many options.  But I'm not sure what the demand level will be with 4E being sunsetted.  <br/><br/>thanks,<br/>Lee                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
