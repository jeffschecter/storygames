In an MMO, we nest games pretty deep, because some games are short-term and some are long-term. In something like WoW, the smallest games are things like \xe2\u20ac\u0153hit Heal on time.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Then you get \xe2\u20ac\u02dckill the foozle,\xe2\u20ac\x9d and above that \xe2\u20ac\u0153kill a hell of a lot of foozles\xe2\u20ac\x9d and above that \xe2\u20ac\u0153make yourself stronger by picking the right gear\xe2\u20ac\x9d and in some cases \xe2\u20ac\u0153make your guild stronger\xe2\u20ac\x9d and so on. <br/><br/>Ideally, for an MMO, you want your highest level games to be ones that cycle naturally, rather than reaching an end. That way people can keep playing if they want to \xe2\u20ac\u201c the game doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t boot them out. <br/><br/>Each of these games needs to have fun choices in its own right. It can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be repetitive and dull. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to accidentally make a system repetitive and dull, so you have to watch out. </blockquote>\nHe's talking about MMOs, but does the same rule apply?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102386/#Comment_102386" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T23:49:00+00:00" title="October 10, 2007 11:49PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2007 11:49PM by JDCorley.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a chessplayer character in a LARP for a while.

Fred and Rob always talk about how the mechanics themselves should be fun - this is kinda the same isn't it? If you can make every sub-system, or mini-game if you will, within the larger "game", from conflict resolution to character creation to world burning to pitching the series fun within it's own right, then you're already well on your way to creating a good, fun game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
