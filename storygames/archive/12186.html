The way we played it at Arcanacon, it was mostly freeform/larp - but there were tabletop elements. We had a map of the ship lying on a central table; the GMs sometimes rolled dice, or told us secrets; once or twice they made judgment calls on situations in the game.<br/><br/>Now, when hearing about multiform, I thought it sounded pretty awkward. But it ran pretty smooth, and I'm thinking the idea has some merit. When running Society of Dreamers at Knutepunkt, people started getting up and acting out scenes physically; we sat down between scenes to set up scenes, make cards etc, then got up again for the next scene. It was actually pretty cool, and gave us breathing room between some intense scenes. Also, it was a very clear ritual to mark "end of scene". It let us connect and plan when that was necessary, and perform when that was necessary. I would never have expected this to work, but it did, and I'm thinking more and more about using multiform in design.<br/><br/>Does anyone else have experiences with this? I know Vulpinoid does - we've talked a bit about it in the Australian Freeform thread (which is a great thread, search for it). But anyone else?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273270/#Comment_273270" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T04:31:06+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  4:31AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs -- The <a href="http://www.ganakagok.com/ganakagokfreeform" rel="nofollow">"jeepforged" version of Ganakagok</a> that I've run a couple of times works almost exactly like that. Players are divided into teams (or "spirit tribes") each with a particular scene-setting or scene-guiding function; once the scene-setting decisions have been made, some players take on character roles and enact the scene. Once it's finished, everyone goes back into scene-setting mode. What's neat is that it's GMless, but the GM functions are justified in the fiction by players taking on the roles of the spirits that shape the world. -- Bill                        </div>\n<div

certainly seems to be to me, although the one that strikes me a bit is the goal of the designer.<br/><br/>It seems to me that in the Multiforms, the design goal is to put on a presentation game played probably just once ( perhaps with sequels at the original designer's choice), and in the context of a particular mix of people (not necessarily known to the designer) at a particular convention.<br/><br/>I just notice this in contrast to say, the culture of design where the eye is focussed on creating a document to be spread to entirely unknown people, somewhere out there, to be played in their own local group ( with a profit motive, even a humble one, often figuring into the thinking).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

No dice involved, but we did have a beautiful map to place ourselves with and some written materials. We started out the game with standard descriptions of the scene and setting by the GM, some shared description from the players, and then we moved into the main plot where we acted out the trial.  <br/><br/>With only 5 players, 2 played the lawyers and 3 played all the various witnesses (with the GM as the judge), so at various times we would sit on the couch watching (and interjecting) then jumping up to play a character as needed. I got the impression that this kind of play was pretty normal in Denmark, semi-live they called it. It's a great way to play. I also really enjoyed it in The jeepforged version of Ganakagok. <br/><br/>When I've played with some folks from Europe (listen as I lump them all together) meta talk was frowned upon, as breaking the flow or immersion, but I've seen it work just fine to move from one type of interaction to another.

There was a group of people with different agendas and relationships, and the situation was that we'd all arrived at the family's home to read the will of the recently deceased head of the family.<br/><br/>All of gameplay was talking and drama, no combat or physical action, so we pretty quickly started walking around to have separate conversations with various characters, and it was a lot of fun. The GM would gather us back to the table for important moments when we were all together (like the reading of the will), but most of the time we kind of moved around and talked to each other in character. There was no effort made to map the physical space we were in to the fictional space the characters were in, but getting up from the table allowed us to have all our "in-character" conversations at the same time, instead of sitting through other people talking, and made for a really fun game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273412/#Comment_273412" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T06:17:54+00:00" title="May 28, 2010  6:17AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, that sounds interesting!

There was a group of people with different agendas and relationships, and the situation was that we'd all arrived at the family's home to read the will of the recently deceased head of the family.<br/><br/>All of gameplay was talking and drama, no combat or physical action, so we pretty quickly started walking around to have separate conversations with various characters, and it was a lot of fun. The GM would gather us back to the table for important moments when we were all together (like the reading of the will), but most of the time we kind of moved around and talked to each other in character.</blockquote>\nIn most parts of Australia, this description could easily fit between two modes of play.<br/><br/>"Small Scale Freeform"<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"Multiform"<br/><br/>The dividing line is whether any types of game mechanisms are used.<br/><br/>If the moments when the GM gathered the players involved any type of mechanism (rolling of dice, drawing of cards, comparison of traits, voting by players, etc.), it'd probably fall on the multiform side of the divide. This is especially true if the GM says things in an "out of character voice" (eg. "Now you see this", "Now you feel that", "Roll to see if you notice XXX").<br/><br/>If the GM in this type of situation engages the characters through a role of their own, continuing the immersion of the scene but adding narrative elements to the story through this portrayal, it'd more likely fall on the "Small Scale Freeform" side of the divide.<br/><br/>Like most terminology, the problem lies with the fact that different people use the same terms to mean different things.<br/><br/>I've participated in "multiforms" that resolve conflict through "karma", "drama" and "fortune". I've participated in "multiforms" with one GM, 2 GMs, more...(I don't think the style of play can work GM-less, it seems to need the presence of a strong dominant figure to pull things back on track and keep the momentum flowing). Some multiforms use established game systems from major companies, others use ad hoc rules designed by a session designer to reflect a very specific set of circumstances.<br/><br/>Some multiforms use the prefix "multi-" to represent a fusion of two or more game systems in the same session...<br/><br/>"We're running a game set in an asylum...it will last three hours. For fifteen minutes at the beginning of each hour we'll use "A Penny for my Thoughts" to reveal something about our characters...for the remaining 45 minutes of each hour, we roam the room and compare traits with one another if a fight breaks out, or if any type of conflict between characters emerges."<br/><br/>Some GMs use the term "multiform" to simply mean "Live roleplaying in which costuming is not necessary".<br/><br/>I hope I haven't confused the issue too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273691/#Comment_273691" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-30T20:38:18+00:00" title="May 30, 2010  8:38PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2010 8:40PM by ccreitz.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I run Paranoia this way - we walk around and act out our scenes, using a small number of props.

We need some multiform AP! <br/><br/>"Extrovert-demands" are essentially what I would class as those areas of multiform or live-action play that might require extroverted behaviour from participants, e.g. physical action, immersion-acting, public speaking, spontaneous action, instant and resolute decision making.

If you have a couple folks who want to take a strong GM role, you might want to try out <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/upgrade/" rel="nofollow">The Upgrade</a>. There are 8 main roles, but it works well with a group of people playing audience members who can jump in and mix things up as well as the main cast. If you are looking for something completely loopy, <a href="http://gnavpotveksler.wikidot.com/projects:butter-forger" rel="nofollow">The Butterforger</a> is a trial scenario with a very large cast of witnesses.<br/><br/>The jeepforged version of <a href="http://www.ganakagok.com/ganakagokfreeform" rel="nofollow">Ganakagok</a> can handle a large number of people too, since they work in teams.
