But the random charts made up for it and I ended up playing a Elf girl with a long sword who admired maids soooo much she had to become one, oh and we decided the Jesse's maid was my twin sister, who also was a vampire. Did I mention that the setting was Shadow Run with Horror? A definite highlight was the random event in which it was revealed that I had been a ghost the whole time. We also had carzy eldrich magics, secret diaries, bazooka wielding maids, black op teams and robo maids. Awesome, I am definitely ordering this game today</p></li>\n<li><p>Houses of the Blooded, I heart this game and it never fails to deliver for me. Had lots of fun playing a Serpent Spy Master for the Duke.</p></li>\n<li><p>the Ryan Macklin Drunken free-form UA game, nothing like making up F'ed up stories around the camp fire while consuming copious amounts of whiskey.</p></li>\n<li><p>Zombie Cinema, played 2 games of this Sunday morning the 1st one was Brazil with Zombies and the 2nd one was an attempt to do a serious game which took place during the 70's in an Office Building.

Everyone found the campsites without trouble. Food setup and cleanup happened without myself or Nancy needing to harangue anyone. There was lots of good alcohol, but an appropriately contained amount of hangover. Games fit their time slots, so we didn't have schedule creep. People were up and about for solid morning gaming. Even with investing a bit in "camp-owned" equipment, we came in comfortably under budget.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170525/#Comment_170525" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T12:11:28+00:00" title="September 22, 2008 12:11PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Albert - glad to hear that things went smoothly on the organization side, we all appreciate the work you and Nancy put in!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170528/#Comment_170528" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T12:24:55+00:00" title="September 22, 2008 12:24PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2008 12:28PM by WillH.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Albert and Nancy are truly awesome for organizing these events and doing all the shopping for lunch and breakfast.<br/><br/>I was in Morgans Spirit of the Shattered Earth game where I played <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Thundar</span> Thunderhawk the Free Man while we did battle with the Spoiled Prince of Bel Air and his zombification ray atop Griffith Observatory.  <br/><br/>In the Macklin FATE game I recovered the Crown Jewels and the minute arm of Big Ben while battling the forces of the Demon Tsar.<br/><br/>Mythender, we ended the troll, goat, roc, Saracen eyed chimera.<br/><br/>3:16, killed some lactating, ejaculating fury, otter, badger ape things and some headless zombies.
