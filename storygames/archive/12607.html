The game cannot be played until you do this stuff.

So that level would not put me off.<br/><br/>It also depends on how the DIY version looks and feels compared to the finished.  That is to say that if the finished version is basically a DIY version that the publisher has put together for me, then I am much more likely to buy the DIY version and do it myself.  <br/><br/>I'll play your game with the abstract currency and say the DIY version should be 50 units.

Printing full colour at the local print shop set me back another 8 euro. I laminated the board and cards myself, so that's "free" but it doesn't account for the fact that I paid for the laminating paper and machine a wile ago (it was a good investment anyway).

Consumer: eeeh, can I get a complete product, too?\n<blockquote>Doe this directly impact your perception of the game's quality, utility or fun?</blockquote>\nNo, not really.\n<blockquote>Would it impact your purchasing decision? If so, how?</blockquote>\nWell, when I spend cash monnies for a game I usually expect it to be playable "out of the box". Having to do extra work yourself feels like...pirating, actually. I can download the rules for any Fantasy Flight boardgame from their site for free. I can then make my own board and tokens if I'm willing to do it...but it feels like cheating. Yeah, not so much as being cheated ("I paid for it and there are pieces missing?!") but cheating. It's like paying for just half the product, because you're too stingy and making the other half yourself. Weird.\n<blockquote>If the same game was available in a "finished" version for 100 Abstract Currency Units, how many Abstract Currency Units should the DIY version cost?</blockquote>\nWell, going by the Montsegur example above and pondering about it for a while...if a finished game was worth 100ACU, I'd be willing to pay 30ACU for an "incomplete" version. I'd go as high as 40, but it would have to be a really good game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283229/#Comment_283229" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T06:37:58+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  6:37AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on how much DIY is involved.

Spending 90min with a bunch of sheets of paper, i want to feel like i came away with something, and learning how to play at the same time would greatly increase the value/make the crafty set up feel less like a chore.<br/><br/>100 for the "fantastic version" then 15 for the rules and i can download the stuff i need to print and play for free.

No biggie. Something about multiple sheets of paper though is a tipping point. If glue is involved, that's a big deal. <br/><br/>Is your market right? A game about mecha fights in a hip-hop post-industrial cityscape that requires you to make papercraft robots hits one audience square in the teeth. Requiring me to cut out 100 cards before i can play bejeweled and you've lost me. Certain audiences are more into this shit than others,  model train builders, war-gamers, etc.<br/><br/>is there an easier way to play with even cheaper components? can i just write stuff down on index cards as i go instead of printing and cutting and gluing?

When I printed the cards double-sided, the fronts and backs did not line up perfectly - they were off by about 1/8 inch.  It wasn't a big deal; I cut them out based on the front.  Someone might be able to game the system by noticing which backs line up with which fronts, but I'm probably not going to play the game with the same group of people often enough for that to be a real problem.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I tried to prep the little booklets for Apocalypse World, and discovered I had a choice between having all the information print and having the layout work.  In the end it wound up being simpler and less time-consuming to re-impose the player booklets from the player chapter, print them as 4-page wonders, and use them instead of the mini-booklets.  <br/><br/>I don't mind assembling, but I have to be able to complete the process without too much frustration.<br/><br/>So my suggestion, which you're free to take for whatever you think it's worth - cards should be laid out with ample whitespace to compensate for printing inconsistencies, and preferably sized and laid out to make printing easy.  I've had excellent luck printing cards based on Avery business card templates, for instance; I've considered re-laying out the Monts\xe9gur cards to suit Avery business cards and postcard templates as a favor to story gamers in general, just to reduce the hassle factor of starting to play.<br/><br/>Also, in my notebook I found a note that says that someone at GPNW recommended superiorpod.com as a source for POD cards for games.  I can't vouch for them any more than that, but if they can produce cards to your specifications for a reasonable price, you might be able to sidestep the whole issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283326/#Comment_283326" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T11:58:30+00:00" title="July 28, 2010 11:58AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A related thought on lowering potential barriers to DIY - include instructions and resources for doing something the easy way.

No biggie, but the answer to "how much for the DIY version" is simply "cheaper!" Maybe not that much cheaper--70-90% sounds right to me, depending on the level of cost of the DIY stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_283377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283377/#Comment_283377" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T15:39:19+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  3:39PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2010 3:40PM by TomasHVM.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason Morningstar asked: <i>What is your reaction to this, both as a player and a consumer?</i><br/><br/>I will consider the game less interesting. I'd rather have a finished game, ready to play, so I would probably not buy a game that demanded such efforts from my side. It would have to be really cheap, and highly recommended, for me to buy it.<br/><br/>So if a solid buy would cost me 400 coins, then this one had to be prized at less than 100. And it had to be an absolute must.

Make materials available via a print on demand site (e.g. www.artscow.com), this way if people don't want to PnP, then they have a visually nice way out.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. There's a neat game called 1000 Blank White Cards.  In the game you create the cards used in the game and mix in more blank cards (either old business cards or index cards cut in half).  When you draw a blank card, you create a new card to help you on the spot.  At the end of the game, you draft a couple times to keep the best cards for the next game.  What if creating these extra components was something you did during the game and then they held over some percentage of them (or all of them) for the next game?  This way you are only making what you need at the moment and over multiple plays you slowly create or complete your set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283388/#Comment_283388" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T17:06:53+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  5:06PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>I'd be happier if there was also a lazy option.<br/><br/>Like, "Here's how to play if you want to use a standard deck of cards -- here's the correspondence between them and the game's cards."<br/></blockquote>\nFunny thing is, I own a couple of games that have that in the core rule books.

Certainly it would get less play than more polished/completed games.  Cards are a tactile experience as much as they are informative.<br/><br/>Could you look into substituting the cards temporary for a less expensive vehicle, eg. creating a deck for Vassal (which is simple to hack into)? Or have some sort of generator created online?  You are likely to find a larger audience that games with nearby computing (either phone or terminal access) than you are to find a marketable group of paste-eaters.<br/><br/>Perhaps none of that directly addresses the pricing on DIY gaming.  But I'll add that last GenCon i attended (2008) I didn't purchase two of the hotter games because they were produced poorly.  Now, unfinished/incomplete/DIY games don't specifically mean shoddy play but it does prematurely hobble your venture.  Maybe what i'm trying to say is that there aren't two prices.  I'll either buy it for x units or not.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283420/#Comment_283420" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T21:30:47+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  9:30PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Avery makes a pretty decent clean-edge blank business card stock.

I think part of the deal would be that it had to be extensible, moddable, expected to be hacked and refined by every recipient.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283461/#Comment_283461" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T07:32:36+00:00" title="July 29, 2010  7:32AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2010 7:33AM by komradebob.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=277" rel="nofollow">Here's where I officially challenge you!!!</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283462/#Comment_283462" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T07:36:49+00:00" title="July 29, 2010  7:36AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2010 7:43AM by Tim C Koppang.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When it comes to pricing, it's less about percentages and more about absolutes.  If you offer a DIY verson for $1 and a pre-made version for $10, I'm going to buy the pre-made version.  If the DIY version is $10 and the pre-made version is $100, I'm going to look at the DIY version.  In fact, I will always look at the pre-made version first.  If it's affordable, bingo.  If not, then and only then, will I be looking at the DIY version.<br/><br/>As for level of difficulty on the DIY, everyone is going to have a different threshold.  For me, if you're asking me to print and cut a handful of cards, I'm on board.  If you want me to print a ton of cards, cut them out, and do some mounting, eh, I'm on the fence now.  If there's more complicated stuff like lamination, glue, hordes of different components, etc. -- well,  I'll play someone else's set.<br/><br/>EDIT:  This specifically does not include extremely simple DIY stuff like printing character sheets, etc.  That stuff is just standard and takes no real effort on my part.  For example, I can't see myself ever paying extra for a bunch of pre-printed player aids that I could run off myself (unless they are really exceptional).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12607/question-are-you-willing-to-make-stuff" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12607/question-are-you-willing-to-make-stuff" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12607/question-are-you-willing-to-make-stuff/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12607%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12607%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
