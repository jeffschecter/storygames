However, when I've used that tag in the past the thread is usually me posting about how I get the most out of game I enjoy.  Not this time!  This time I'm requesting such a post from you guys.<br/><br/>So I really like Don't Rest Your Head, however, I have serious problem every time I run.  Now to be clear I have only ever run it in a one-shot con environment.  I'd like to run a longer form of the game but I need to get past a hitch I have in applying the rules.  The hitch is this: <br/><br/>I have trouble interpreting Pain, Exhaustion and Madness domination as things that move the situation forward rather than evolving the current situation.  This results in kind of a narrative "wheel spinning."  The current situation keeps getting more and more complex but we never move forward.<br/><br/>For example, the last game I ran, we spent almost the entire session in a stair well.  Pain and Madness kept dominating and so things in that stairwell kept getting more complex as players turned to address each new added complication, rolled to address the new complication and then having MORE complication show up with Pain or whatever dominated.<br/><br/>Some examples from that scene:<br/><br/>There was a cop pursuing a PC up the stair well as two other PCs were coming down.  The cop drew his gun and demanded they all stop.  One of the PCs shouted at the cop that something strange was going on and that he needed to help them.  Another PC wanted to grab his gun.  So they both rolled.  Pain dominated for the shouting PC and Madness for the gun grabbing PC.  Both succeeded.<br/><br/>For Pain I decided that right at the moment the shouting PC was being her bitchiest to the cop was the precise moment that a guy she had been flirting with earlier stepped into the stair well.  For Madness I described how at that moment vines started cracking through the stair well walls and the staircase started shaking.  That led to a third PC's sister nearly falling off the stair well which led to that PC trying to catch her which of course called for a roll.  He succeeded so Pain dominated.  For Pain I said that he caught her but he dislocates his arm and he's just barely holding on to her.  The sister pleads that he should save himself and drop her.  He refuses and pushes her not to give up which lead to a roll in which Madness dominated.... and so on.<br/><br/>I think there was a good hour and a half spent in that stairwell like that.  Things I might be doing wrong:<br/><br/>1) Maybe I'm rolling for too small of situations.  Is Don't Rest Your Head supposed to be more like PtA where there's one or two things at stake in the whole scene and then we move on?  I always treat it more like Sorcerer with moment-to-moment conflicts.<br/><br/>2) I always treat Pain, Madness and Exhaustion dominance as having immediate consequential effects that usually present new choices.  In other words, those things dominating means I introduce a new Bang.  Maybe those things are meant to be interpreted more as color and shading and less as, "And now you have to deal with THIS!"<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/5niper9" title="5niper9"><img alt="5niper9" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/5niper9">5niper9</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264085/#Comment_264085" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-25T14:59:55+00:00" title="March 25, 2010  2:59PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run this game two times as one shots.<br/><br/>Just as a data point:<br/>I've treaded the conflict system more like one or two conflicts in a scene. When there's an officer of Tock's men trying to arrest on of the awake we roll and most of the time after one roll or two it's settled. <br/>Also Sorcerer's bobs come to mind. The scenes in which the characters end in a dead end, have to take a rest and rearrange their plans are to me very important contrasts to the madness going on in the streets.<br/><br/>The second point depends on the situation. I certainly wouldn't play every Domination of Pain, Madness or Exhaustion as a Bang. This is less structural and more like a judgement of the scene from the GM. <br/><br/>Hope this helps.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Ren\xe9                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264124/#Comment_264124" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T00:04:07+00:00" title="March 26, 2010 12:04AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in a game Fred ran at a con.  The characters had a finite mission.  The mission had leads, and obstacles in the way of those leads.  Sometimes it took one roll to overcome an obstacle, sometimes it took several.  <br/><br/>Domination of Pain, Madness or Exhaustion contributed little at the moment of resolution; the color invoked was more about character momentum, what sort of change you were undergoing and fate you were heading toward.  <br/><br/>We made a ton of rolls in the session, getting us all the way to where one character went insane and several were close to passing out.<br/><br/>The tension of "can you complete your mission before you get too many bad dots on your sheet?" was fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264204/#Comment_264204" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T21:23:03+00:00" title="March 26, 2010  9:23PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2010 11:04PM by noclue.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only ever played this at a Con game myself, and I've only ever played while Colin ran it. So, I've got the same limited experience you do. However, when we've played the die roll always moved things forward first and then the result was colored by madness, Pain, etc.<br/><br/>So, if pain dominated (but didn't succeed) I would get to narrate getting everything I wanted in the scene and then Colin would piss in my Cheerios and show how that victory turned to ashes in my mouth. If Madness dominated I would narrate succeeding in a way that brought out madness and chaos.<br/><br/>But no matter what die dominated the scene was always resolved by the roll.<br/><br/>EDIT: Colin just pointed out to me that when Madness dominates the PC has a fight or flight reaction that moves the scene forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
