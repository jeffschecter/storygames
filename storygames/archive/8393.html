We (well, really, just me) have been agonizing over a one-on-one horror type game for awhile and finally after some input from a bunch of different fronts Ellen was like "Unknown Armies sounded cool." I'm glad she said that. I could have spent a year in limbo figuring out what to use.<br/><br/>So I don't really play "trad" games much anymore and after running this for just one session I'm like "Oh man, why?" The "You control your character, I control everything else" division of authority seems a lot more comfortable for Ellen. And also the wall of secrecy is almost necessary for a horror game.<br/><br/>Brand recommended following the prep rules, and I did, and I don't know chronologically when the whole relationship map idea came on the gaming scene, but it's in there and it's solid.<br/><br/>I came up with an instigator: a bibliomancer who wants some kind of super rare magic book. Maybe he doesn't even care what the book does. He just wants the book. There's a betrayal in here too. Okay, he was working with some group of occult investigators and when they came on clues leading to this book he screwed them over somehow. We'll keep it vague. I throw in some other parties. An Avatar of the Demagogue because I want one, and a demon because I want one of those too.<br/><br/>Now it had to morph to tie into what we currently had, but I ended up with a magic book that gives you instructions on how to successfully murder anyone. The occult investigators become a weird secret society that's trying to locate a serial killer so they can channel the ritual energy of the murders he (or she) is committing and make this killer their leader. They have no knowledge of the book. The demon is the current holder of the book. Someone summoned the demon to help her find it, and it took her over and now it has the book and is murdering people. The Demagogue is a friend of the possessed person who warned her against doing what she did and is now trying to track her down and save her.<br/><br/>Awesome. Thank you, Unknown Armies and Brand (and Jamey and Dave who helped me brainstorm).<br/><br/>So the basic setup with Ellen's character is this. Tracy Jacobs is obsessed with crime scenes. She got a job working for a small computer project called Sherlock that takes data from crime scenes and does pattern matching and data analysis to try to find trends in crimes committed and predict future occurrences. Tracy is not a computer geek. What she does is "visits" crime scenes in the New York City area, take photographs and document details, and then provide them to the team for entry into the database for analysis.<br/><br/>So, to skim over the session details real quick, the company goes bust right after Sherlock starts reporting that a string of murders committed in the city match on murders committed about a century ago. The computer hardware is claimed by one of the owners of the company. Tracy, while out pursuing her interest in crime scenes on her own, returns and finds that her apartment is in a different state than when she left it and ends up finding a camera hidden behind her book case. One of the other members of the project, Hopkins, an ex-detective doing consulting work for the company, calls her and asks her to check out a crime scene. The owner who claimed the hardware (a man named Shipman) was murdered and stuffed into his trunk. She goes to the crime scene at night, gets some of the details, and another car arrives. Someone else has an interest in the scene. It turns out to be a man named DeRais - one of the other investors in the company. They talk briefly, Tracy is mostly interested in getting away from there, and she leaves. The next day he calls her and offers her a lot of money to track down whoever murdered Shipman.<br/><br/>To tie it back into all that original prep: DeRais and Shipman are members of the secret society. They invested in Sherlock in the hopes that it would help them locate a serial killer. The Bibliomancer also wants to find the serial killer, so he tries to steal Sherlock, there's a violent confrontation, and Shipman is killed.  DeRais at this point isn't sure if Tracy is clueless or if she's working for the Bibliomancer so he hires her to keep tabs on her.<br/><br/>Oh and the video camera was totally him. The secret society is keeping tabs on the Sherlock team in case they pursue the project anymore on their own or if they have any more information that might lead them to the serial killer.<br/><br/>It was a slow session, mostly setting the game up and building some tension. Ellen was regularly worried that she was doing something wrong and that made me worry the pacing was too slow, but I think it went pretty well. In the post-mortem we thought maybe we could have hit on her Passions more. I haven't read them to see if a Passion is triggered if you HAVE to act on it, or if it's just something there to give you mechanical oomph when acting in accordance with them. And we also thought she might have to make an Isolation stress check. Ellen thinks we should make it, I'm kind of inclined to agree. The situation is weird and bizarre, and talking to people on the phone and texting them when people are leaving surveillance equipment in your home when you're not there is stressful enough as it is.<br/><br/>We'll probably play again soon. I like the game a lot. I'm also glad I'm playing with someone who hasn't read the book. Unknown Armies has some very cool bits in it and I think the loss of mystery that goes along with reading the book and finding out what it's about is unfortunate.<br/><br/>This wasn't much of a vignette, was it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185607/#Comment_185607" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T13:04:47+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  1:04PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2009 1:05PM by JuddG.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked it.  UA was always a favorite of mine.  I always saw it a bit a sister game to "Over The Edge" in some way.  <br/><br/>The few sessions of it I ran were Stress-fests (mainly due to the subject matter of School Shootings that were hot in the news).  During a single attack that the PC was mainly trying to flee, he was exposed to such violence that he very nearly cracked.  As he was finally taken to a medical center and his parents arrived, the pendulum swung to weird when his hippy cultist parents sent him off with strangers (to him, not them) because they feared it was a pogrom of their Coven.<br/><br/>I like the Book for Perfect Murders as a focus, but my question is will the use of the book stymie her ability to discover the killer?  I assume the book tells you how to murder someone without getting caught, but it seems the Cult and Tracy will need to find the killer to close the circle.  Maybe I misunderstand what the book does and it just tells you the best place and method to use to kill a given target.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185643/#Comment_185643" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T20:07:29+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  8:07PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>I don't know chronologically when the whole relationship map idea came on the gaming scene</blockquote>\nAs far as I know, Chicago By Night was the first, in 1991, of course, it caused brain damage...<br/><br/>Srsly though, thanks for the info, that sounds like a cool setup.

If you accurately wrote down the relationship on the map it would be something like "friends, but I wouldn't stick my neck out for him".  Sorcerer's relationship maps dodge this as well as any I've seen by being inherently weighty...but there is something good about having a list of people who people think it would be cool to interact with too. But threatening them or yanking them in does not give a lot of narrative oomf. This may or may not be the issue you're facing here.<br/><br/>Another possibility for further development is unintended consequences, though you have to be sure not to discourage the player from doing things.<br/><br/>Another another possibility is to hand someone on the relationship map (including the player character) exactly what they want basically for free and watch everyone go ballistic trying to stop them from doing what they want to do.<br/><br/>Thanks for the thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185685/#Comment_185685" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T07:24:55+00:00" title="January  2, 2009  7:24AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I what's happening is that she's sort of orbiting the relationship map.
