With some trepidation, I thought I'd share some of the Actual Play of my just-kicked-off new campaign, which I have only somewhat tongue-in-cheek named the Postmodern Masks of Nyarlathotep. I have an <a href="http://www.obsidianportal.com/campaign/pmon/" rel="nofollow">Obsidian Portal site</a> if folks want to drop by, but I was hoping that besides sharing the AP here, I might talk about ways to make the game more narrative, more player controlled--in short, more story game.<br/><br/>I say I named it this way only partially tongue in cheek because I really am trying to include some postmodern (or at least the folk understanding of postmodern) elements into the game. One is to have some crossovers from other literary &amp; other works--after all, we're already in one fictional universe (Lovecraft's), so why not add some others? So, for example, Charles Foster Kane is an NPC in the game and the PCs may have interactions with him--and there are some real doozies to come down the road.<br/><br/>The other rationale, however, was that while the original Masks was pretty far ahead of the curve for its day, we've moved on, both in the real world concerns (Masks is mostly admirable on race, but silent about gender and sexuality--not unusual for the time, but no reason to hold ourselves to that limitation) and in construction of the adventure itself. So I've changed stuff. Lots of stuff; some details major (I've moved several of the chapters either to places I'm more familiar with or are unexpected; two members of the group played through the campaign with me about a year ago, and I want there to be some surprises) and some minor (Jackson Elias is a woman.)<br/><br/>I see myself as player and GM as, in Robin Laws' terms, a Method Actor, so I tend to go heavy on characterization and use whatever tools are at hand. So, for example, before the game proper kicked off we ran a custom Fiasco playset I made to get some backstory for the PCs. This turned out to work extremely well, and created some very interesting backstory that was incorporated into the session itself.<br/><br/>So I'll, uh, get too it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407284/#Comment_407284" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T20:51:43+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  8:51PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prelude: France, 1918<br/><br/><i>[This was the results of the Fiasco playset]</i><br/><br/>It is the spring of 1918. After four years of pointlessly bloody stalemate, the German Army is once again marching on Paris. Inside the City of Lights, soldiers and civilians struggle to find some semblance of a normal life.<br/><br/>Just out of the hospital, where he had been drying out from an extended absinthe bender, is Roland \u201cFreddie\u201d Blakely, wastrel Englishman rich enough to buy his way out of the Army. While enjoying the hospitality, he made the acquaintance of Lt. William Blont, a corpsman recuperating from a gas attack. Haunted by the death of many of his comrades, Blont was trying to do with a bottle what the Germans had failed to do with phosgene.<br/><br/>Blont\u2019s commander, Maj. George Pearkes, VC, wanted to bring him up on charges\u2014provided he could find him. He asked freelance journalist Elisa \u201cJax\u201d Olney to help him. Olney and Pearkes had previously crossed paths when an ordinance shortfall had nearly killed him; her assistance saved his life, although he usually gave the story out the other way. Olney agreed to help him provided he find a way to get her to the front; she\u2019d so far been unable to secure permission to report from there.<br/><br/>Meanwhile at the Moulin Rouge, bartender Alphonse Gilbert, formerly of the French army, briefly a guest of the German Army (along with Major Pearkes, who had effected his escape almost immediately), and current high-ranking member of the Communist Party in Paris, entertains Blont and Blakely. It is at the Moulin that Blakely is reunited briefly with Olney, an old fling of his from before the war, when they were both Socialist sympathizers. Their reunion is mostly entertaining for the other patrons, and ends, as so many of these encounters do, with Blakely\u2019s drink splashed in his face.<br/><br/>Blont is preparing to be invalided back to the States (an American, he volunteered with the Canadians in 1914.) Pearkes, having caught up with him, cancels those orders and instead orders him back to the front. Olney, however, intervenes and Pearkes reluctantly allows him to be transferred instead to Archangel where the Allies are aiding the White Russians.<br/><br/>Blakely, however, hatches a plot to try and make everyone happy. Giving Gilbert an absurd amount of money, he has the bartender use his contacts to change the orders. Blont is discharged and returns to America using Olney\u2019s ticket; she, in turn, will get to go to Archangel and report from there. Happy that everything has been apparently wrapped up, Freddie returns to England.<br/><br/>Time passes. The war ends in a bitter armistice. In France, Alphonse Gilbert uses Freddie\u2019s money to bankroll the abortive Paris Soviet, which is quickly crushed. Finding France suddenly inhospitable, he moves to New York City. Olney, now writing under the pseudonym of \u201cJackson Elias\u201d, files a number of dispatches from Archangel and then the last days of the Western Front; after the Armistice, she researches death cults around the world and writes a couple of books thoroughly debunking their myths.<br/><br/>Freddie discovers that the Foreign Office takes a rather dim view of financing Communist revolution; he is their guest for several months until his fearsome aunts effect his release on the condition that he find residence in some other country. Having stayed in New York before the war, he returns there and takes up the management of his aunt\u2019s weekly newspaper, the Golden Sentinel, a theosophical and spiritualist rag. On the recommendation of Dr. Henry Armitage of Miskatonic University, he hires a young Chinese-American man named Charleston Chiu as one of his reporters; Chiu had previously worked on a story with Jackson Elias, shortly before she left New York to work on a new book on the occult.<br/><br/>Gilbert, having become a respected member of the Jewish Mob who specializes in \u201ccleaning\u201d crime scenes, has a chance encounter with Jackson Elias, who hires him to investigate a \u201chaunted house\u201d in Harlem. After a hair-raising experience, Gilbert goes straight and eventually is hired as a valet by Blakely.<br/><br/>Major Pearkes is promoted to Colonel but finds his career stalling out, although he has also found happiness with his fiancee, Constance B. Copeman. Much to his chagrin he is removed from line command and sent to New York as aide-de-camp for the British Embassy.<br/><br/>William Blont returns home to discover that Freddie\u2019s work has unexpectedly made him a war hero; he receives a citation from President Wilson. Desperate to avoid the spotlight, he has a checkered career and loses his family due to his alcohol use and difficulty overcoming his wartime experiences. By 1925, however, he has moved to New York City, working odd jobs while earning a good reputation as a sidewalk doctor who is always willing to help out the unfortunate.<br/><br/>Then suddenly Jackson Elias returns to New York\u2026<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407286/#Comment_407286" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T20:54:20+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  8:54PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2013 8:55PM by Aviatrix.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Passion of Jackson Elias (Part 1a)</b><br/><br/><i>Monday, 16 February 1925</i><br/><br/>In the early morning hours, a car careens up the Queens-side ramp to the Queensboro Bridge. At the wheel is Charleston Chiu, intrepid occult reporter, and Alphonse Gilbert, valet to Chiu\u2019s boss, Freddie Blakely.<br/><br/>They are pursuing three creatures they saw leaving the Maspeth cemetery, which Chiu had wanted to stake out after hearing reports of grave robbers. The creatures prove both tough and acrobatic; Gilbert hypothesizes they are orang-utans. One of them scrambles up a support cable and springs onto their car. Chiu slams on the brakes, and Gilbert fires a burst from a Tommy gun into the creature. It is slowed down but not stopped; Chiu guns the engine and runs it over.<br/><br/>Another of the creatures stumbles into oncoming traffic and a pickup truck spins out of control, slamming into Chiu and Gilbert\u2019s vehicle. Gilbert staggers out and shoots one of the creatures, blasting it off the bridge and into the river. Unfortunately, the third creature, having dodged the oncoming truck, pounces on him, mauling him with claws. Even a burst at short range does not stop this creature.<br/><br/>Chiu jumps into the cab of the truck, does a quick J-turn, and races at the creature. It rolls out the way, still holding on to Gilbert, but it is enough of a distraction for the Frenchman to throw it off of him. Chiu fishtails around again and smashes the creature.<br/><br/>By now the sounds of police cars racing towards the bridge from Queens can be heard, so Gilbert and Chiu take the truck into Manhattan, eventually ditching it and going to Brenda\u2019s Diner in Harlem. There they encounter their boss, Roland \u201cFreddie\u201d Blakely, notorious playboy and nominal publisher of the Golden Sentinel, stumbling out of the Cotton Club.<br/><br/>Meanwhile William \u201cDoc\u201d Blont wakes up in his SRO in Kip\u2019s Bay. As he is heading out to his longshoreman\u2019s job, the desk clerk hands him a telegram from Jackson Elias, asking him to meet her at Grand Central Station that morning. He calls in fired to his job.<br/><br/>At the Sentinel, Freddie meets Addison Bright, former playboy gone straight.<br/><br/>\u201cAh, Sunshine old man! What can I do for you.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cJust checking that you\u2019re coming to the charity ball tonight, old sport.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThe ball?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes, the one I wrote you about three weeks ago, called you about two weeks ago, and dropped by to remind you about last week.\u201d<br/><br/>Freddie calls for his secretary, Sheila. \u201cAbigail old girl, am I going to a ball thingy tonight?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes, Mr. Blakely.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh, and about the check, it doesn\u2019t need to be certified, old man.\u201d says Bright.<br/><br/>\u201cAnastasia, am I bringing Sunshine a check?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes, Mr. Blakely.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI am? Capital! How much?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c$25,000, Mr. Blakely.\u201d<br/><br/>Meanwhile Blont arrives at Grand Central and waits for Elias; nobody matching her description gets off the train. However, a young newsboy approaches him; this turns out to be Elias in disguise. She asks to stay with him for the day, and casually invites him to come to Bright\u2019s charity ball.<br/><br/>At the Sentinel, Shelia sees Bright out. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you here today boss. Not only because it\u2019s a Monday, but because you told me you were meeting your friend Elias today.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDid I?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes, Mr. Blakely, you got a telegram two weeks ago.\u201d<br/><br/>Buried under the coat checks and tailor\u2019s bills on his desk, Freddie finds the telegram from Jackson Elias, asking him to meet her at the docks at 9 AM and pleading for him to not be late.<br/><br/>\u201cShelia, what time is it?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c9:05 AM, Mr. Blakely.\u201d<br/><br/>Freddie hustles to the docks with Chiu and Gilbert. The purser tells him that no one using any of Elias\u2019s aliases had been on the ship. A passenger who resembles Elias gives Blakely a message explaining that she would see him at Bright\u2019s ball that evening.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407287/#Comment_407287" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T20:54:52+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  8:54PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Passion of Jackson Elias (Part 1b)</b><br/><br/>At the British Embassy, Pearkes meets his indefatigable chief of staff, Captain Sam Steele. \u201cRemember you\u2019re to go to Mr. Bright\u2019s ball with the ambassador tonight, Colonel.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cVery good Steele. Now, be a good fellow and walk MacDonald.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cExcellent sir,\u201d says Steele as he picks up the elkhound\u2019s leash. \u201cAfter all, that\u2019s what I went to Sandhurst for.\u201d<br/><br/>Elias asks Blont to go to the British Embassy to secure a passport under a different identity for her; although as the daughter of a Canadian she is entitled to a British passport, she insists that it not be under her name. She also asks Blont to go by her old office on 135th street and see if anyone is watching it. Blont heads out to accomplish these missions, stopping in the meantime at the docks to see if he can arrange for an emergency transport out of the city for Elias; while he doesn\u2019t understand what she is afraid of, he wants to make sure there\u2019s a backup plan to get her to safety. He finds Mr. M\u2019Dari, a respected East African foreman.<br/><br/>\u201cAh, the doctor! What can I do for you, my friend.\u201d<br/><br/>After Blont explained his problem, M\u2019Dari nodded gravely. \u201cYes, it can be done. It will not be cheap! But it can be done. Do not worry. M\u2019Dari knows everything! It is all up here,\u201d he says, tapping his head. \u201cI keep it all up here. That is why they trust M\u2019Dari!\u201d<br/><br/>Blont meets Pearkes coming in the front door of the Embassy. While Blont has mostly tried to put the war behind him, Pearkes still nurses resentments over Blont\u2019s drinking on duty while under his command. He examines the paperwork for the passport, and recognizes Elias\u2019s picture; he also notices that the papers are earmarked for Smythe, a rather shady clerk in the passport office. He decides to hold the papers until Elias can meet him to discuss the situation, and tells Steele to show Blont out of the Embassy.<br/><br/>Steele looks at Blont. \u201cI say, you must have been on the Western Front.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes. Yes, I was.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing but respect for you chaps. Only made it to East Africa myself. But you had much worse.\u201d He pauses. \u201cTell you what I can do. I\u2019ll see if I can get the papers from the Colonel and have them put through myself. Would that be all right?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThanks very much, I\u2019m grateful.\u201d<br/><br/>Blont then swings by Elias\u2019s old office and confirms that it is being watched by several black men.<br/><br/>At Bright\u2019s ball, Chiu fast-talks his way past the master of ceremonies and the off-duty cops providing security; his press pass may not be the best, but it\u2019s enough to get him in. Blont arrives at the back of the Waldorf, where the ball is being held, and a friend of Elias\u2019s gives him a waiter\u2019s jacket and tells him to go out and serve drinks.<br/><br/>The British ambassador arrives, accompanied by Pearkes and his fiancee. They meet Blakely, Chiu, and Gilbert; Constance, Pearkes\u2019s fiancee, is very taken with the playboy Blakely, chastising Pearkes for not introducing her to his famous friends. Blont arrives with drinks, and Bright ushers all of them in the back to view some Gainsboroughs he had recently acquired.<br/><br/>In the back room they meet Elias, wearing an evening gown.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat ho, Jackson, what\u2019s all this bother about?\u201d says Freddie.<br/><br/>\u201cAnd why do you want a passport with a false name?\u201d demands Pearkes.<br/><br/>\u201cBecause I might need to run, and don\u2019t want to use any of the names people know me by,\u201d says Jackson.<br/><br/>\u201cJust what is wrong?\u201d asks Blont, with concern.<br/><br/>Elias lights up a cigarette. \u201cIf I told you, believe me, you couldn\u2019t deal with it.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI say!\u201d<br/><br/>Chiu mutters something about hoping the dead don\u2019t come back again, referencing his previous adventure with Elias.<br/><br/>\u201cI asked you all here because I need some help,\u201d says Elias. \u201cFreddie, I need your help to get me an interview with Erica Carlyle.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cCarlyle? Not Rotten Roger\u2019s sister? I knew him slightly, back in the day. Something terrible happened, didn\u2019t it?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cHe was torn to pieces in the African bush. Him and everyone with him.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWhat\u2019s the other thing,\u201d asks Pearkes.<br/><br/>\u201cThere\u2019s an auction tomorrow, and I need you to buy something for me. A dagger, with an ibis head.\u201d<br/><br/>Blont shakes his head slightly. He is concerned for Elias; in his medical opinion, she\u2019s obviously suffered a recent breakdown and is exhibiting the symptoms of paranoia. \u201cWhat\u2019s really going on, Jackson?\u201d<br/><br/>Elias takes a long drag on her cigarette. \u201cNot all the members of the Carlyle expedition died. I\u2019ve talked to Jack Brady, his close friend, this year in Singapore and Shanghai.\u201d<br/><br/>The others try and get more information out of Elias, but she clams up. Pearkes offers to bring her to the Embassy for her protection, but she refuses. \u201cI\u2019m not going any place where there\u2019s guns and walls to keep me leaving.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWell, me and the Admiral\u201d\u2014meaning Colonel Pearkes\u2014\u201ccan handle the auction, and I\u2019ll just pop out and see if Erica\u2019s here,\u201d says Freddie.<br/><br/>Blakely finds Erica Carlyle in one corner of the ballroom, drinking the seltzer water that was the strongest thing Bright was serving. With her is her beau, Bradley Grey, a lawyer who\u2019s occasionally bailed out Freddie, and Constance Blythe, the Colonel\u2019s fiancee. \u201cI say, Erica, would you mind if one of my reporters popped by tomorrow?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cCertainly, Freddie. Just have your man call my man and we\u2019ll arrange something for the afternoon.\u201d<br/><br/>The group soon splits up again, having decided that Blont and Chiu will accompany Elias to the Carlyle mansion on Long Island, while Freddie, the Colonel, and Gilbert will attend the auction.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407290/#Comment_407290" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T21:29:04+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  9:29PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to hear some more about how you used that Fiasco playset.

Both the Tilt and the Aftermath were based on the Soft Tilt and Soft Aftermath from the Fiasco Companion (the Soft versions simulate a John Hughes movie rather than a Coen brothers movie). I basically chopped off the worst results on the Aftermath table.<br/><br/>--I arbitrarily assigned everyone an extra die after the tilt, so there was only one scene in the Second Act.<br/><br/>--I put dice in for myself during the setup but removed them once play started<br/><br/>Let me see if I can remember the relationships:<br/><br/>Blont-Pearkes: Officer &amp; Soldier<br/><br/>Blakely-Gilbert: Barkeep and Patron<br/><br/>Blont-Blakely: Patients in the Same Ward<br/><br/>Pearkes-Gilbert: Ex-POWs (we assumed that the capture happened during the fluid days of 1914 and both soon escaped or were liberated.)<br/><br/>Olney-Blakely: Lovers separated by war<br/><br/>Olney-Pearkes: You and the guy who saved your life<br/><br/>Location (Blakely-Gilbert): At the Moulin Rouge<br/><br/>Need (Blakely-Olney): To get ahead by...fomenting Socialist Revolution!<br/><br/>Object (Blakely-Blont): A broken gas mask<br/><br/>Neither the object nor the need came much into play, which was just as well. Gilbert's player seemed interested in how rich man Blakely and reporter Olney were socialists, and out of that emerged the idea of him being a member of the Communist Party. Blakely's player and I had a wonderful spat over their (now long-dead) relationship, which everyone liked. (At this point I played Jax with my finest Old New Yawker accent; in the actual game I toned that down a lot. I assumed she dropped the accent as her career advanced.)<br/><br/>If you used a regular Tilt and Aftermath, I think my 1918 playset would work just fine for a Fiasco game. I'd never tried to write one of those before; it was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Two of the players had never done Fiasco before and one of those was pretty new to RPGing, or at least the RP-heavy RPGing I was trying to encourage, so they were a little inhibited--that's why Blont and Gilbert didn't initiate much action in the writeup. Pearkes' player and I had played Fiasco together, and Blakely's player was fulfilling a lifetime goal of playing a Wodehousian character (character concept was basically Wooster without Jeeves), so Freddie got a lot of screen time.<br/><br/>Charleston's player was late and didn't participate in the Fiasco game, which was just as well as Charleston was too young to be in WWI. Ironically, he was the one that suggested a Great War prelude to the game. Doing it in Fiasco was my idea, however.<br/><br/>While the actual Fiasco play maybe wasn't up to the heights that game can hit, it really paid off during the Trail gameplay. The idea of Gilbert being Freddie's valet emerged during gameplay but it made a lot of sense given their background. Pearkes and Blont had some ready made history (played a bit strong by Pearkes' player--Blont's player politely told him to back off later in the session, mostly because of some past history with a different player in another game who had been a little domineering.) Plus, it gave me a rationale--a bit of a contrived rationale, perhaps, but a rationale nonetheless--for Jax to bring these guys together; she knew them all during the war, and most of her other contacts were burned by this point.<br/><br/>Wow, that was long-winded, but I hope it clarified things for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407333/#Comment_407333" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T07:09:28+00:00" title="February 26, 2013  7:09AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice!

He heads down to Sotheby\u2019s and meets Dr. Simon Martin, one of the curators.<br/><br/>\u201cGood morning, I\u2019m with the Golden Sentinel. I\u2019d like to cover today\u2019s auction.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes, I know your paper,\u201d says Martin a bit dubiously. However, he remembers that the paper\u2019s primary readership is rich society matrons with a taste for ancient artifacts.<br/><br/>\u201cFree publicity,\u201d says Chiu, holding up his camera.<br/><br/>Shrugging, Martin takes him back to the lot storage. The auction will cover a wide variety of antiquities, from Greco-Roman artifacts through Chinese artwork. Distributing his questions cleverly, Chiu still manages to discover that the dagger in question is incredibly old\u2014reliably dated as being from pre-dynastic Egypt, some 4,000 years ago. The ibis, he explains, was a symbol of the god Thoth, one of the Egyptian deities of the dead.<br/><br/>Freddie does a bit of digging about the Carlyle expedition, dropping by his club to talk things over with one of his drinking companions. \u201cStinky\u201d certainly remembers Carlyle, and his man Jack Brady. He mentions that Carlyle buggered off for Egypt with his psychologist in tow, along with his supposed girlfriend Hypatia Masters, flapper daughter of an armaments manufacturing family. \u201cStinky\u201d intimates that Roger might not have been so interested in Miss Masters.<br/><br/>He also reminds Freddie about a certain African woman that Roger seemed to be fascinated by: some poetess calling herself M\u2019Weru or something like that; always wore these Egyptian-style masks.<br/><br/>\u201cSay, Freddie, do you know who else went with them?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cCan\u2019t say I do, old sport. Who?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cPevensey!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWho\u2019s that, old bean?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cViscount Pevensey. Sir, ah what was it, Aubrey Penhew. Landed gentry from the Midlands, excellent old family. Knew the Carlyles somehow, they were friends.\u201d<br/><br/>While Freddie whiles away the time upstairs, Gilbert drops by the servants\u2019 lounge and strikes up a conversation with the club\u2019s longtime butler. No friend of the toffs upstairs, he rails about how Carlyle brought his thug friend Brady to the club. He shows Gilbert the club\u2019s scrapbooks, which contain several pictures of Carlyle and Brady. Gilbert notices a tatoo on Brady\u2019s hand that marks him as not just a former U. S. Marine, but one that had been on duty in Shanghai.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407374/#Comment_407374" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T10:09:36+00:00" title="February 26, 2013 10:09AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Passion of Jackson Elias (part 2b)</b><br/><br/><br/>Will Blont decides that now is the time to get some weapons. He drops in on Luigi\u2019s tailor shop. Several months before, he had stitched up the tailor\u2019s son, who was wounded in a mob turf war.<br/><br/>\u201cAh, Mister Doctor! What can I do for you?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIs your son around?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh no, sir,\u201d says Luigi, motioning with his head towards the back room. \u201cWe don\u2019t do anything illegal here! Now, why don\u2019t you go in the back and I\u2019ll get your suit for you?\u201d<br/><br/>In the back room, several mobsters are working various wire fraud and numbers games. Luigi\u2019s son is happy to oblige Will. Opening a drawer, he gives Blont a .25 Colt automatic\u2014\u201ca sweet little gun, good for a lady\u2014\u201d and .38 Automatic.<br/><br/>Gilbert also decides to get heeled, picking up a sawed off shotgun that fits neatly in his valise and a M1911 .45 automatic from one of his underground contacts.<br/><br/>Pearkes drops in on the ambassador and asks for him to expedite a pistol permit for himself. Also, he wants to bring Elias in; the Ambassador refuses this request, but agrees to put pressure on the City for the permit. Pearkes and Steele motor down to Centre Street and cow a county clerk into giving them the paperwork.<br/><br/>In the afternoon Chiu, Blont and Elias motor out to the fabulous Carlyle manor, which overlooks Huntington, Long Island. As they approach the manor, Elias asks the two men to do her a favor\u2014make sure that they ask Erica Carlyle about \u201cVanessa,\u201d and ask her about Roger\u2019s books. When quizzed about this, she says that Erica does not like her, and she wants one of them to ask since they\u2019ll have more of a chance of success.<br/><br/>\u201cNice ride,\u201d says the valet as they pull up in Freddie\u2019s Bugatti.<br/><br/>\u201cThanks,\u201d says Chiu. \u201cI took it from my boss with his explicit knowledge. It\u2019s only stolen if I don\u2019t come back with it.\u201d<br/><br/>They are led into the mansion, but before they can enter the parlor, they are stopped by a large man clearly carrying a gun. \u201cHold on,\u201d says Joe Cory, the Carlyle bodyguard. \u201cI gotta search you. We\u2019ve had people trying to break in here.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cAll right,\u201d says Charleston, and begins to strip off his clothes.<br/><br/>\u201cHey, wait! Stop that! Get your clothes back on, you [racial slur]!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDon\u2019t you need to search me?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYou\u2019re fine! Sheesh!\u201d<br/><br/>Blont nervously smiles. He was carrying his two new guns. He and Charleston discuss the bodyguard and decide that instead of a break-in, Erica might have been the target of a kidnapping attempt.<br/><br/>Erica enters the parlor after they are seated. Her demeanor instantly changes when she sees Elias. \u201cIf I had known it was you, I wouldn\u2019t have said yes to Freddie.\u201d Charleston defuses the situation with some banter, and the interview commences.<br/><br/>Elias asks several questions about Erica\u2019s trip to Africa to recover Roger\u2019s remains, and many other questions about the expedition personnel. She seems to be circling around the idea that maybe Roger is still alive, which is distasteful to Erica.<br/><br/>\u201cYou know, I was the older sister, but Roger inherited everything when our parents died, even though he had no head for it. Washed out of every school he ever attended! It\u2019s taken me almost five years to put the companies back together.\u201d<br/><br/>Chiu inquires about the books. \u201cOh, those. I destroyed them,\u201d says Erica, but both Blont and Chiu pick up a subtle movement of her eyes towards the bookcase.<br/><br/>\u201cWould you perhaps have some records of what they were?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI might have the indexes of purchase, that sort of thing.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cAnything you could give me would be helpful. You wouldn\u2019t want any negative publicity to get out about them, would you?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI suppose you could pick them up tomorrow.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cSplendid. Oh, one more small thing. We\u2019re trying to learn whatever we can about a woman named Vanessa\u2014\u201d<br/><br/>Erica stands up. \u201cYou know about Vanessa? What do you know?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWell, we\u2019re trying to learn more\u2014\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have a board meeting to attend. Cory will see you out.\u201d<br/><br/>At Sotheby\u2019s, Freddie, Gilbert and Pearkes, with MacDonald in tow, arrive just in time for the auction. The crowd is mostly rich playboys and society matrons; however, there is a contingent of what Freddie assumes are rather diminutive Chinese men, all identically dressed in black suits with bowler hats. Surprisingly, they do not bid on any of the Chinese artifacts\u2014they only start bidding when the Dagger of Thoth comes up for bidding.<br/><br/>\u201cPre-dynastic Egyptian dagger, in wonderful condition. Do I hear $10,000?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c$10,000,\u201d says Pearkes, although that is a year\u2019s salary for him. He looks at the others. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s never the last bid.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c$10,000, going once. Going twice. Going\u2014\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c$15,000,\u201d says one of the bowler-hatted men.<br/><br/>\u201c$20,000,\u201d says Freddie, languidly.<br/><br/>\u201c$25,000!\u201d exclaims Bowler Hat.<br/><br/>\u201c$50,000.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c\u2026.$55,000.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c$60,000.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cUh\u2026$61,000.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c$65,000, old man.\u201d<br/><br/>The auction ends with Freddie victorious, and the bowler hat contingent departs in a huff. Following the reception, Freddie, Gilbert and Pearkes go around back to the loading dock, where they receive an enameled box containing the dagger.<br/><br/>They get in a cab to head back to Freddie\u2019s apartment. They have not gotten far when a black car swerves in front of them; their car T-bones it, screeching to a halt. Another car pulls up alongside of them, boxing them in.<br/><br/>Two bowler hatted men jump out, carrying shotguns. \u201cYou will please give us the dagger. Move and you will die,\u201d they say, pointing their guns at Pearkes, who had a thought about using his pistol.<br/><br/>Thinking fast, Freddie dexterously slips the dagger out of the box and replaces it with his letter-opener, which is approximately the same size. (It was also once General Marlborough\u2019s letter-opener and a priceless family heirloom, but Freddie conveniently forgets this.) \u201cNo trouble, old man, here\u2019s the box.\u201d<br/><br/>The men take the box, and then gesture with their shotguns. \u201cYou will come with us.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cRighto.\u201d<br/><br/>Gilbert jumps up too, as Freddie had expected. They are crammed into the rear seat, facing two angry looking little men with very large pistols.<br/><br/>As they begin to drive away, Pearkes sprints to the back of their car, MacDonald barking loudly in his tow. He manages to leap onto the trunk of the car. Thinking fast, he tries to slit the rear tire with his sword cane, but the wheels are out of reach.<br/><br/>Determined not to let the men get away, Pearkes draws his pistol and makes a brilliant shot, blasting the driver in the shoulder. Shrieking in agony, the little man barely clings to consciousness. The two gunmen inside the car both shoot at Pearkes, but the veteran of Passchendaele easily dodges.<br/><br/>Freddie kicks one of the gunmen in the face from his crouch by the door, spoiling his aim. Meanwhile, the second car pulls up behind them. Pearkes decides to leap onto its hood, but unfortunately the driver slams on the brakes, causing Pearkes to land hard face-down on the pavement. The second car speeds over him, leaving him bleeding in the street.<br/><br/>Consolidating their men into one car, the vehicle speeds into Chinatown, where Freddie and Gilbert are led into a closed up storefront. Thinking quickly, Freddie manages to drop the real dagger into a display of tourist junk.<br/><br/>In the backroom, they meet another bowler-hatted man. He is polite but harsh: \u201cI will check to see if this is the correct item, and then I will let you go.\u201d<br/><br/>Of course, inside the box is Marlborough\u2019s letter-opener. The man is enraged. \u201cExplain this,\u201d he snarls at them, \u201cand I will decide whether or not I should kill you on the spot.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me, old man. I just got rooked out of $65,000!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cCould it be that I was cheated by the auction house? Damn them!\u201d He rages violently, but Freddie manages to calm him down enough to decide not to kill one of New York\u2019s more famous citizens. Leaving them tied up (and taking the letter-opener), he departs with his minions.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407375/#Comment_407375" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T10:10:01+00:00" title="February 26, 2013 10:10AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Passion of Jackson Elias (Part 2c)</b><br/><br/>After a long hour, Gilbert manages to free them using muscles tuned from his study of savate. They stumble out into the Chinatown night. Lacking a car, they take the Subway, an experience Freddie is instantly enamored with.<br/><br/><br/>The group converges on Freddie\u2019s apartment. Elias, chain-smoking nervously, bursts into tears when Freddie hands her the dagger. Meanwhile, he has Shelia call up Bradley Grey for him.<br/><br/>\u201cGrey here.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDorian old chum!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c\u2026.what can I do for you, Freddie?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cListen, old man, call up Sotheby\u2019s and tell them I\u2019m suing them for fraud! They sold me the wrong bloody dagger!\u201d<br/><br/>Elias tells the group that she has one more lead to follow up on, and departs. Blont, Chiu, and Gilbert tail her cab.<br/><br/>\u201cFollow that cab!\u201d says Charleston as they pile into a car.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat a novel expression! That\u2019s the first time I ever heard that!\u201d<br/><br/>They are temporarily foiled when Jax switches cabs at a light; the cabbie of the car they were following says that she jumped out at the intersection. Stumped momentarily, Blont recognizes one of the wise guys he knows from the streets.<br/><br/>\u201cYeah, Doc, the broad in the white hat? I seen her, she got in a cab and told it to go to the New Yorker Hotel.\u201d<br/><br/>Having lost about fifteen minutes, the three investigators race to midtown and burst into the lobby.<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, I have to protect the privacy of our guests,\u201d says the clerk. He shows signs of being implacable on this matter.<br/><br/>The lights flicker momentarily. \u201cThe wiring in this place is terrible,\u201d the clerk mutters.<br/><br/>Charleston tries to work him. \u201cListen, pal, I\u2019m following my wife. I\u2019m trying to make things up with her, and I just need to talk to her.\u201d<br/><br/>A group of black men walk into the lobby, carrying tools. \u201cHey, you [racial slurs], get out of here. Go around to the service entrance!\u201d shouts the clerk.<br/><br/>\u201cBut we are here to fix\u2014\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI don\u2019t care! Get in back!\u201d Turning back to Charleston, he says \u201cSorry, mac, nothing I can do. Listen, I\u2019m gonna step out front for a cigarette,\u201d and gives Chiu the high sign.<br/><br/>Blont, frustrated by the clerk\u2019s seeming intransigence, simply walks outside, down the alley, and into the service entrance. He finds the elevator operator taking a cigarette break. \u201cYou new here?\u201d he asks.<br/><br/>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m the foreman of that repair crew. You just take them up?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYeah, took \u2018em up to 17. Give me a minute to finish this, and I\u2019ll take you up. Wanna butt?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThanks,\u201d says Blont.<br/><br/>Gilbert decides to just push past. The hotel dick collars him. \u201cListen, we only allow guests back here, and we for sure don\u2019t let punks with guns back here.\u201d<br/><br/>Fortunately, a year of doing Freddie\u2019s grunt work has left Gilbert prepared. \u201cListen, I\u2019m a private dick myself\u2014here\u2019s my license. I\u2019ve been watching that crew for weeks now, and I need to get up there to bust them!\u201d<br/><br/>It takes some convincing, but the hotel dick is convinced. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll take you around back and send you up the service elevator.\u201d<br/><br/>He meets Blont at the elevator and they ride up together to the seventeenth floor.<br/><br/>Outside, Chiu and the clerk share a cigarette. \u201cListen, buddy, I sympathize\u2014got an ex-wife myself. Yeah, I gave that lady a room, 1705. When we get back in I\u2019ll distract the dick and you can go on up.\u201d<br/><br/>As he gets off the elevator on the 17th floor, two burly men wearing merchant marine uniforms of some kind manhandle an old man into the elevator. One sneers at Chiu. \u201cIs not business,\u201d he says, and slams the elevator gate shut. Shrugging, Charleston quietly breaks into room 1703, which, as luck would have it, has an adjoining door with 1705. Peering through the keyhole, he sees at least two men moving around, and no sign of Jackson.<br/><br/>Gilbert and Blont arrive. After listening intently for a moment, Gilbert sprints to 1705. He crouches by the door, and slowly opens it up a crack.<br/><br/>He can see a man standing in the corner, holding a club, and two other men near the bed. All the men are wearing African tribal masks. And stretched out on the bed is the unconscious body of Jackson Elias.<br/><br/>At that moment, Charleston bursts open his door. The man closest to the bed raises a dagger, ready to plunge it into Jackson\u2019s chest. Chiu shoots him, spinning him around.<br/><br/>Gilbert bursts into the room and shoots the man standing in the corner. The man with a knife plunges it into Jackson\u2019s stomach. Enraged, Blont shoots him in the chest.<br/><br/>Gilbert gets clubbed by the man. Charleston shoots the man with the knife again, dropping him. Blont fires from the doorway again, wounding the other man, who runs at the doorway that Charleston is crouching in. Gilbert blows off the top of the man with the club\u2019s head.<br/><br/>Charleston fires again, plugging the last man right between the eyes. In just a few seconds, it is all over. Outside, the other patrons are panicking and screaming for the police.<br/><br/>Charleston quickly gathers up the guns and races to the basement, where he finds a service tunnel that eventually leads him to the subway station. He ditches the guns in an incinerator. Gilbert stays behind and uses his forensic knowledge to clean up Will Blont.<br/><br/>The cops arrive, and both of them are arrested and thrown behind bars\u2014Blont to the drunk tank (sadly, a familiar locale) and Gilbert into a holding cell. He calls Freddie, who then phones Bradley Grey.<br/><br/>By early morning, the two have been arraigned and had all their charges dismissed, thanks to Grey\u2019s legal wizardry. As they leave the precinct, a paperboy runs up and sells them a newspaper.<br/><br/>WHITE SLAVERY RING BROKEN UP IN HOTEL, screams the headline.

In retrospect, that seems to neither fit with the intention of investigative abilities or principles of fairness; I essentially charged him a point-tax. Bad form! I consciously let up on that later in the session (thus, Charleston's Player (CP) didn't have to make a spend to get the clerk to give up the room number.)<br/><br/>One of the interesting things about Trail as opposed to other systems I've run (in the last year, mostly Pathfinder) is that by emphasizing other aspects of the narrative than combat, it makes it easier for me to enforce consequences to violence.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I'm getting this across, so: most of the RPGing 1.0 games and their descendants are heavily combat-oriented, often to the detriment of any other aspect of gameplay. (Hell, Pathfinder is explicit about this: 3-5 encounters per 4 hours, 13 encounters per level.) This leads to a subtle encouragement, I think, to make fighting more or less consequence-free. After all, if the whole impetus of the game is combat, it's not fair to penalize PCs for engaging in it. <br/><br/>In the case of Trail, the numerous mechanics emphasizing the psychological damage of combat (I called for stability rolls from everyone after the shootout, for example) plus the high emphasis on interpersonal skills means that combat is merely <i>one</i> possible response to situations, and often not the best one. (You don't risk stability from using Oral History, for example, at least not often.) This feels like, at least to me, that there's more narrative space to explore the effects of violence.<br/><br/>In this case, although it looks like the PCs have gotten away with things (and if you're one of my players--close your eyes now!) in fact I'm planning to have the next session heavily revolve around the consequences of the shootout. After all, there's a huge hole in their story--two of the dead cultists were clearly shot from the adjoining door, not the front door. The police might (the times being what they were) be content to let that go, if no pressure was applied to them.<br/><br/>I'm going to apply that pressure :-)<br/><br/>Oh, a couple of places I've used this phrase or one of its variants: "[racial slur]". That is, in fact, how I pronounced it--I wasn't using the actual epithet, but saying the words "racial slur" or "sexuality slur". This was the best way I could come up with to engage the pervasive racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. of the times without actually, you know, engaging <i>in</i> it. One of my goals with this campaign (and part of its "postmoderness") is an examination of the hidden and not-so-hidden bigotries of the genre and the times. If I do it right, it won't be heavy-handed. I hope I do it right.<br/><br/>So, for example, it's pretty clear already that Roger and Jack Brady were lovers. These won't be the only LGBT characters. I also have changed the interpretations of several characters to highlight the contradiction of the era's expectations of them and their actual nature. (For example, I made Erica Carlyle the older and more capable sister, cut out of her natural place at the head of the family by the sexism of her father.)<br/><br/>And I'll do all that without being preachy! I pray.<br/><br/>*Rather than giving the players aliases, I'll refer to them by initials--the PCs name, plus P for player.

I'm trying to avoid making the plot have a price list; after all, I (somewhat) forced the whole kidnapping. OTOH, Freddie's Drive is Bad Luck, which is why he got kidnapped instead of just robbed. So it's a bit of a wash; just something I want to keep my internal eye focused on.<br/><br/>As for the "postmoderness" of the game: I'm being a bit tongue in cheek there. But maybe only a bit. I'm definitely dragging in a lot of elements from other fictions, and being relatively "referential" in my descriptions and even things like the images I'm using for the NPCs (they're all actors; Jack Brady, for example, is "From Here to Eternity"-era Frank Sinatra, and the Carlyles are all members of the Redgrave clan). This is "postmodern" in the common understanding of our post-"Simpsons" world.<br/><br/>However, I'm also trying to engage with the modernist milieu of "Masks" and comment a bit on it, and the pulp genre in general. Quite a bit of pulp is of course racist, imperialist, sexist, homophobic, and white-male supremacist. (Even higher class pulp, like Chandler, who I adore, operates in this vein with surprisingly little self-awareness.) And while the original "Masks" was quite commendable in its understated commentary on racism and imperialism, there's more to be done. So I'm going to try and push the commentary further, by changing the characterization of many of the main NPCs. M'weru, for example, will be a much more dynamic character and far more sophisticated in my retelling. I've made the occluded nature of Roger and Jack's relationship explicitly gay. In other words, make the subtext the real text, sort of how "Far From Heaven" took the subtext of a Douglas Sirk movie (race, homosexuality) and built the plot out of it.<br/><br/>Or a more recent example: is the Ronald Moore "Battlestar Galactica" a "postmodern" retelling of the original BSG? Maybe? Kinda? Dunno?<br/><br/>But the BSG reboot comes really close to how I'm approaching this and has a lot of similar techniques--the reboot expanded the interior lives of the characters, gender-swapped several, was a lot more open about sex and sexuality, and explored many ideas that were only implied in the original. Henh. Until I typed all that, I wasn't really aware how much alike the projects are. (Obligatory poor artists steal comment goes here.) But then I was a huge fan of the reboot and probably one of the few people who didn't hate the ending. <br/><br/>Not sure that answers your question, but that's a decent precis of my thoughts on the matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407454/#Comment_407454" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T21:21:20+00:00" title="February 26, 2013  9:21PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is neat; I'm a fan of "Masks" and I love the idea of rebooting it with a 21st century sensibility.

In other words, what's happening among the players, who initiates what (particularly spends), and so forth. Incorporating them into the AP rather than adding this information as an addendum later can give us a better sense of how the narrative develops at the table.

I haven't read it yet, but my hat is already off to you for your audacity in "The Big Hoodoo." (An adventure where I could theoretically punch the Admiral in the nose? Sweet. ;-) )<br/><br/>You have an excellent point. I've mostly been reposting the adventure log I did for the portal site, so it's necessarily clung to the fiction. (Also, I was following in the tradition of that <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?449331-Trail-of-Cthulhu-Masks-of-Nyarlathotep" rel="nofollow">great RPG.net Trail/Masks thread</a> from a while back.)<br/><br/>But I'll try to intersperse some commentary in the next installments. This was two weeks ago now and I'm going from my memories of a long session (we're old school in our habits; sessions run 8-10 hours), so things will necessarily be a bit fuzzy.<br/><br/>But wait! I can give some more general notes :-)<br/><br/>I think I prompted for most of the buys. This was the second session of ToC I've run, and except for GP, who was in the first one (a pickup game where I recruited him), everyone else's first session of ToC ever. So there was some system learning going on.<br/><br/>That said, I do think that it mostly went along the lines of a player asking me about something and I would answer with a point buy suggestion. For example, Freddie being able to grab Erica at the party was a credit rating buy, as was his outrageous bid at the auction. (FP, who has always wanted to play a Wodehouse character, was in fine feckle the entire session and quickly jumped into the "buys get me cool things" aspect of the game.) I had stressed previously that the game allowed a lot of narrative control.<br/><br/>Another way I would prompt for buys was, in answer to a question about whether something was there or not, to say "why don't you tell me?"<br/><br/>That said, as I noted above, I think I went a bit overboard with requiring buys. I'm pondering letting folks refresh a point or two on an investigative ability before the next session.<br/><br/>There was a lot of plot this session, with a few deliberately designed chokepoints/set pieces: the charity ball, the meeting with Erica, and the auction/robbery. So there was some constraint on the PCs narrative freedom. OTOH, going to the club (Credit Rating buy from Freddie), buying weapons (Streetwise from Blont and Gilbert, Bureaucracy from Pearkes; I had fun explaining how tight the Sullivan law was to him), various research activities were all initiated by the players; I was able to improvise them on the fly, which is my style anyway. (I didn't bring much in the way of notes; obviously, I had the Masks book, but you may notice we didn't exactly get very far in it.) I wasn't sure that the PCs would follow Jax to her mysterious rendez-vous, but I was pretty confident they would.<br/><br/>I'll try and post a more incisive AP tonight; we're almost to the end of the session, but there were a few more details that got crammed in at the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407521/#Comment_407521" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T16:34:02+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  4:34PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So in light of Bill's request, before I post any further on the storyline (which is, after all, over on the obsidian site), I'll go back and discuss in more detail what's already happened.<br/><br/>So without further ado...I give you the <b>Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep: The Annotated Edition</b><br/><br/>Or is it the commentary track?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407528/#Comment_407528" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T17:03:31+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  5:03PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Prelude</b>\n<blockquote>It is the spring of 1918...</blockquote>\nSo, having decided to do a Great War prelude, the question became: when? CP, who suggested the idea, wanted to go back to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, but I decided that 1918 made the most sense--not only would it justify Americans being in France, but the period around Operation Michael really did put the war in the balance, briefly; a little more oomph from the Germans and the Armistice would have looked different.<br/><br/>I tried hard to make sure there were a lot of civilian options in the playset, as I knew not everyone would be military or ex-military.<br/><br/>FP dominated the aftermath, making a lot of suggestions to the other players.<br/><br/><b>Episode I, Part 1</b>\n<blockquote>In the early morning hours, a car careens up the Queens-side ramp to the Queensboro Bridge. At the wheel is Charleston Chiu, intrepid occult reporter, and Alphonse Gilbert, valet to Chiu\u2019s boss, Freddie Blakely...<br/></blockquote>\nI gave the players an option for a "cold opening" or a "gradual opening". Ironically, everyone but CP voted for the cold opening. I was happy they did, as that seemed more fun. (The gradual opening probably would have started with Will Blont waking up.)<br/><br/>I wanted to get a combat in early so everyone could get acquainted with the system, especially the General ability buys. The ghouls (they were ghouls) all had Health 0 so they would be relatively easy to take out. I was a bit surprised by CP using the truck to take them out; I gave the truck a X3 multiplier on damage. Seemed to work well enough. On the fly, I rolled 1d6 to figure out which way the police were coming (1: not at all, 2-3 Manhattan, 4-5 Queens, 6: Both sides). \n<blockquote>At the Sentinel, Freddie meets Addison Bright, former playboy gone straight.<br/><br/>\u201cAh, Sunshine old man! What can I do for you.\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nFP established his characterization right away, which I liked. His naming of people follows simple rules: males of his station and age, or people he's forged an emotional connection with, he gives nicknames. Women and older men of his station he calls by their name. Everyone else, he simply can't be bothered to remember their names.<br/><br/>Addison Bright (the man with two endocrine diseases!) is of course from <i>Stunning Eldritch Tales</i>. I considered running the New York chapter of that as part of the game, but it didn't seem to fit the introductory chapter. I may return to it.\n<blockquote>However, a young newsboy approaches him; this turns out to be Elias in disguise.</blockquote>\nI had one main objective in this session: Make Jackson Elias come alive as a character. I find it to be a common weakness of the Chaosium products that character motivation is nearly non-existent. It's not that I don't understand why (Call of Cthulhu was often a one-shot affair, also it just wasn't done in the '80s), but there's no reason not to strive for more. I wanted the death of Elias to be a powerful factor in the game, one that resonated for a long time, and I was willing to burn a session to make it happen.<br/><br/>Also, I came to really like my Elias. I made a prop journal for her that the PCs find in the next installment, and I actually wrote the whole thing out in fountain pen for added realism. It was a fun write, and I really got inside the NPCs head.<br/><br/>Looking back, the single decision to make Elias a woman and to try and make her death incredibly meaningful probably had the most influence on how I thought about the game, far more than the shuffling of locations I also decided to do early on.<br/><br/>Of course, then I completely bollixed up the death at the end of the next installment, but it will all get fixed in the cutting room.\n<blockquote>Blont meets Pearkes coming in the front door of the Embassy. While Blont has mostly tried to put the war behind him, Pearkes still nurses resentments over Blont\u2019s drinking on duty while under his command. He examines the paperwork for the passport, and recognizes Elias\u2019s picture; he also notices that the papers are earmarked for Smythe, a rather shady clerk in the passport office. He decides to hold the papers until Elias can meet him to discuss the situation, and tells Steele to show Blont out of the Embassy.</blockquote>\nHrm, I dropped a scene here were Freddie bought a tux for Gilbert and ran into Pearkes getting his uniform tailored. At this point we hadn't decided that Gilbert was Freddie's permanent valet--Freddie was buying him a tux so he could go to the ball as his valet. We agreed later that it made sense to have this be the case all along, so there was a minor retcon.<br/><br/>PP came down pretty hard on BP in this scene, and in the prelude. He's the kind of player that likes characters with moral certainity, either good or evil, and really played up the overbearing British officer. BP gently asked him to back off a bit later on, which is why in the next installment I tried to make sure that PP didn't have any actual authority over him. Bollixed that up as well, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Pearkes and Steele were both real people, although not close contemporaries. Their characterizations probably have nothing to do with real life.\n<blockquote>In the back room they meet Elias, wearing an evening gown.</blockquote>\nI was hoping that keeping Jax mostly out of the way for the first part of the session would keep the tension up; I think it worked out. The transcript of the conversation is from memory and not super accurate--it went on longer.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the buys by this point of the session.<br/><br/>There hadn't been that many yet. Freddie made some kind of Credit Rating buy in here, and then used another buy to find Erica Carlyle at the party. Charleston used a buy--Streetwise or Intimidate, I think--to get past the security at the ball. I think Blont used a buy to find Mr. M'Dari. (If you know <i>Masks</i>, you'll get that this was not perhaps the best guy to go to. Will has a hard life.)<br/><br/>Steele getting the passport for Blont was pure RP; I don't think I charged anything for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407531/#Comment_407531" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T17:26:52+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  5:26PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Passion of Jackson Elias (part 2)</b>\n<blockquote><br/>Will Blont decides that now is the time to get some weapons. He drops in on Luigi\u2019s tailor shop. Several months before, he had stitched up the tailor\u2019s son, who was wounded in a mob turf war.<br/></blockquote>\nThis was basically a player-induced buy, in that when BP asked if he could find a gun and I said he would know someone, he intuited this was a Streetwise buy. This cascaded through the rest of the players.\n<blockquote><br/>In the afternoon Chiu, Blont and Elias motor out to the fabulous Carlyle manor, which overlooks Huntington, Long Island. As they approach the manor, Elias asks the two men to do her a favor\u2014make sure that they ask Erica Carlyle about \u201cVanessa,\u201d and ask her about Roger\u2019s books. When quizzed about this, she says that Erica does not like her, and she wants one of them to ask since they\u2019ll have more of a chance of success.<br/></blockquote>\nOne of the two main set pieces in the episode. I'm pretty transparent--CP repeatedly said that as soon as he mentioned "Vanessa" the interview would end.<br/><br/>I believe I let Will notice Erica's tell for free (his occupation is Alienist), and charged Charleston something to notice. Evidence Gathering, maybe.\n<blockquote><br/>At Sotheby\u2019s, Freddie, Gilbert and Pearkes, with MacDonald in tow, arrive just in time for the auction.

Surprisingly, they do not bid on any of the Chinese artifacts\u2014they only start bidding when the Dagger of Thoth comes up for bidding.<br/></blockquote>\nYeah. He brought his dog.<br/><br/>MacDonald, Steele, and Constance (his fiancee) are Pearkes' Sources of Stability. I had a bit of trouble with the Sources; I said at the start that I would accept non-human sources, but emphasized that they had to be "frangible, tangible, and unique". So FP gave me "going out on the town" as a Source. We ended up working it out (if he's in a world-class location, and goes on a bender for several days, I'll give him the refresh) and agreed to make Sheila one of his sources.<br/><br/>The question has been raised about what to do with the Sources once the game gets globe-trotting. (FP, PP and myself were players in a more standard <i>Masks</i> campaign a couple of years ago.) My initial idea was that you have to bring 'em with you if you want to get the refresh, but now I'm beginning to think that might get a bit contrived. I'm not sure yet what I'm going to do; one idea I have is to let the PCs adopt significant NPCs they meet on their way as Sources, provided I can prevent it from being abused ("Yeah, I forged a close bond with my cabin boy on the way over from Shanghai, so I'm totally full up now.") I'm still working it out; the Sources look like a bit of an issue for this particular campaign.\n<blockquote><br/>\u201cPre-dynastic Egyptian dagger, in wonderful condition. Do I hear $10,000?\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nI stole the dagger (sort of) and the auction/holdup from one of the adventures in <i>Curse of the Cthonians</i>. It wasn't memorable, so I don't remember the title.\n<blockquote><br/>\u201c$65,000, old man.\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nCredit Rating buy from Freddie, of course.\n<blockquote><br/>The auction ends with Freddie victorious, and the bowler hat contingent departs in a huff. Following the reception, Freddie, Gilbert and Pearkes go around back to the loading dock, where they receive an enameled box containing the dagger.<br/></blockquote>\nStill transparent; they knew once they got the dagger somebody would try to take it. Fortunately, I didn't care that they figured out how this scene and the Erica interview were going to go; in fact, I'm kind of happy that they flowed so quickly into the genre. <br/><br/>Besides, I've saved up my surprises for other things. Veterans of my Pathfinder game (CP, PP, and FP) know that my favorite move is "guy who isn't what we think he was".\n<blockquote><br/>The men take the box, and then gesture with their shotguns. \u201cYou will come with us.\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nI originally was going to have them just take the dagger. Then I remembered I hadn't been hitting the Drives very hard, and that Freddie's was bad luck; so away they went. I actually found a way to make Bad Luck a standard driver: I told him it would cost 4 stability to not have them abduct him (and he would get shot, though not fatally) or he could gain 2 stability by going with them. It was a neat way to give a little narrative control to FP.<br/><br/>Gilbert following Freddie was what cemented our understanding of their relationship; GP is changing his Drive to Follower for next session.<br/><br/>\u201cRighto.\u201d\n<blockquote><br/>Of course, inside the box is Marlborough\u2019s letter-opener. The man is enraged. \u201cExplain this,\u201d he snarls at them, \u201cand I will decide whether or not I should kill you on the spot.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me, old man. I just got rooked out of $65,000!\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nMarlborough's letter opener was my own inspiration; I liked Freddie using a priceless heirloom to replace a...priceless artifact.<br/><br/>This was when I charged the infamous Reassurance-buy-or-get-shot point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407566/#Comment_407566" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T04:09:52+00:00" title="February 28, 2013  4:09AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of neat stuff here.

You should, of course, be quite cavalier about dispatching such Sources. You'll want players to think about just sending their friends and loved ones home. "What was I thinking, bring you along on such a dangerous assignment? I need you to be safe." To paraphrase Voltaire, it is a wise thing to kill an NPC from time to time, <i>pour encourager les autres</i>. NPCs safe at home can still provide support: sending letters and telegrams, or replying to them. A Credit Rating spend might permit a long-distance phone call, or a good Electrical Repair roll or Astronomy could establish a ham radio contact when atmospheric conditions are just right.

They clear him for light duty but warn him that he really needs rest.

Unlike the stocky actual Sam Steele, I see this fictional Sam as one of those thin, ambitious, good-natured British/Canadian civil servants. My own opinion is that he was pretty brave during the war--chasing the Germans around East Africa was a serious challenge--but he feels a bit inadequate about never getting to the Western Front. <br/><br/>PP and I discussed Sam during the game, since Sam is his Source and he should have a lot of narrative control. PP was fine with things, though; he saw it as Sam's reaction to his boss's indignation about losing line command and being posted to an Embassy.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes hobbles over to Elias\u2019s room. Blont has been keeping vigil there ever since he managed to escape from Freddie\u2019s office.

I heard about what happened with your friends last night. I had no idea that Mr. Blont was such a hero! They were both so very brave.\u201d<br/><br/>Charleston, practically swallowing his tongue to avoid mentioning his involvement, merely nods. \u201cToo bad about Jackson, though.\u201d<br/><br/>Erica frowns. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about yesterday. But I don\u2019t like her. She\u2019s been harassing me for months now, with her things about the book and Roger. I want to put all that behind me.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOf course, of course. However, is there anything you want me to say to her?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cNothing that would make her feel better.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[Again, the actual conversation was a bit longer; I think people at the table were genuinely surprised out how vindictive Erica was.<br/><br/>Didn't charge anything for this--I think CP may have made a Bargain buy during the first interview.<br/><br/>I understand it's generally hard to get the books from the Carlyle manse in a more standard </i>Masks<i> campaign.

Now, I\u2019ve got to take my fifteen minute break. You can keep an eye on the place, can\u2019t you doc?\u201d<br/><br/><i>[Medicine got Will the original look at the chart; pretty sure what I charged him a buy for was that Jax had suffered a heart attack before being stabbed. I think that the peek at the records was part of the same buy.]</i><br/><br/>Will browses the file while the clerk steps out. It seems Elias had been shot in the chest back in January, 1924; the wound healed well enough, but she developed a rheumatic infection that left her with a weak heart.<br/><br/>Pearkes meantime goes through Jackson\u2019s effects. He finds a journal wrapped in a leather sleeve. Several clippings and photographs are crammed into the back cover. He begins to flip through it:\n<blockquote><i>I\u2019ve destroyed all my records. From now on, I will keep only the simplest of notes. I\u2019d tell Jonah to destroy the ones I sent him, but I\u2019m afraid he would read them\u2026</i></blockquote>\nA quick scan of the book shows that Elias had been in Shanghai, Singapore, and Cairo during the last quarter of 1924. She visited Paris for most of the month of December, before managing to sneak back to the United States. She writes about being constantly followed by mysterious figures who do not hesitate to kill people to get to her.<br/><br/>There are two photographs in the back\u2014one of a steam yacht in a harbor with Chinese junks around it, and one of a woman. The back of that photo is labeled \u201cVanessa\u2014Singapore.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[Vanessa again! Who is that gal?<br/><br/>The journal was a prop I made. I had a rough leather sleeve that went around an old journal of mine; with a new book, and some time with a fountain pen, I had clue-laden prop that hopefully will entertain and delight. It took me a couple of days to stop writing with Jax's distinctive "a" (it looks a bit like the number 2).<br/><br/>I made my own versions of the business cards that are in the standard handouts--printed them on photo paper and then trimmed them to the right size. One of the business cards reveals the first major location move in the campaign; it is from Edouard Gavigan, </i>directeur<i> of the </i>Fondation Aubrey Penhew<i> in Paris.<br/><br/>I printed the photos out, gleefully stealing the picture of the </i>Dark Mistress<i> from the German version of </i>Masks<i>. Vanessa is portrayed by an atmospheric photo of a young Vanessa Redgrave.<br/><br/>Writing Jax's journal was great fun, and a cool way to introduce clues. I think I managed to capture her getting more and more unhinged over the last part of 1924, and there are several episodes that may or may not have actually happened.</i><br/><br/>Freddie and Gilbert swing down to Prospero House, Elias\u2019s publisher. They meet with her editor, Jonah Kensington.<br/><br/>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know Jax was back in New York,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is so awful.\u201d<br/><br/>They talk a bit about her book, and where she had been. The Carlyle expedition had journeyed to Egypt in 1919. They may have made some discoveries\u2014some rumors circulated about finding a temple\u2014but nothing was ever published. They vanished for a while before suddenly reappearing in Zanzibar. They set out into the bush in Tanganyika, where they were all mysteriously killed.<br/><br/><i>[Another move. I thought Zanzibar would be more interesting than Kenya, so I moved everything down the coast. This is nothing against the wonderful nation of Kenya, of course.]</i><br/><br/>Kensington says that Elias had traveled to Zanzibar and then the mainland to see what she could find out. Then he lost contact with her, except for a few times when she asked for money.<br/><br/>Gilbert asks why he kept sending her money without knowing what was happening, and especially since her book was late.<br/><br/>\u201cTo be honest, she wrote me a letter saying that what she\u2019d found would make us all rich.\u201d<br/><br/>Charleston gets back from the city. He parks his car by Central Park and begins to read People of the Monolith. By sundown, he has a new understanding of the occult character of Egyptian architecture, a splitting headache, and a vague sense of foreboding.<br/><br/><i>[This will not work out well, of course. I offered the party one solitary point of Cthulhu Mythos at chargen; after everyone else passed, CP took it. This made a bit of sense, as his first encounter with Jackson Elias was in the adventure "Dead Man Stomp" which I ran as a preliminary one-shot late last year. Under CoC rules, though. It was in the course of this adventure that Jackson got shot, while attempting to rescue Charleston from some uptown gangsters.</i><br/><br/>Late in the afternoon, Pearkes and Blont visit MacKenzie, the Undersecretary for Domestic Affairs, in the basement of the Embassy.<br/><br/>Pearkes asks if they can get Blont a job with the division.<br/><br/>\u201cYes, sure, we can use a bloke with a head like his.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re back in.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWait a bleeding moment, Colonel. We ain\u2019t like you toffs upstairs. We do actual work down \u2018ere. He ain\u2019t going to have no bloody commission. He\u2019ll be a consultant, like. And he ain\u2019t taking orders from you.\u201d<br/><br/>He turns to Blont. \u201cWelcome to Military Intelligence, Department Six. You take your orders from me. And right now, my orders are to follow his orders, until you here otherwise.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThanks\u2026I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[Sigh. My memory ain't what it used to be; this played out much longer at the table. The gist was to get Blont back into the world a bit, and give him some maneuvering room. During the convo I realized that I was basically putting Blont under Pearkes' control, so I tried to back away from it, resulting in the mishmash you see here. I did basically establish that I could set Blont free at any time.<br/><br/>I've since come up with a very cool, very baroque--shall we say, very Alan Moore--way out of this mess.]</i><br/><br/>Night descends on the city.<br/><br/>The next morning, Steele meets Pearkes in his office.<br/><br/>\u201cMorning Steele. How did our detectives make out last night?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWell, that\u2019s just it sir. There was a blackout at the hospital last night. When the lights came back on, they were both found with their throats slit. And the girl, sir. It\u2019s the damnedest thing. She\u2019s missing.\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407650/#Comment_407650" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T20:27:38+00:00" title="February 28, 2013  8:27PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2013 8:28PM by Aviatrix.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here I bollixed everything up. This was the classic "looking up and oh my god is that the time?" moments; it was a bit early for us, but everyone was ready to break for home. I decided to go with the dramatic "the girl is missing!" ending.<br/><br/>Then I realized, in a flash that a) I had wanted to end the session with Jax's wake, where Charles Foster Kane would make an appearance, and b) I didn't want the entire next session to be about finding Jax, but about reacting to her death. So I bollixed it up, made some half-assed mention of the traditional "there was a lot of blood" and did a forced meeting with Freddie and CFK to wrap up.<br/><br/>Terrible.<br/><br/>In my followup email, I begged the players to treat that as the "next time on Masks" teaser at the end of the episode, and gave them the actual timeline--Jax vanishes Thursday, on Friday a body is fished out of Long Island Sound and identified as hers, she gets waked on Sunday and the funeral service is Monday. I think it will fly.<br/><br/>After the game, in my post-session email thread, FP agreed that Sheila was one of Freddie's sources, and we worked out a deal about how "going out on the town" could function as a Source of stability. (BTW, thanks Bill, for putting some steel in my spine--my ruling will be, "bring 'em if you want to use them" with an aside about how they're not really safe anywhere.)<br/><br/>I've already told the players that as we're all learning the system any changes they make before they leave NY will be approved by me. We all know that characters do stuff at the start of a TV series that never gets used again.<br/><br/>The veterans of my Pathfinder campaign were familiar with what I call "Homework"--basically, I ask the players to come up with some plot-generating details and give them a suitable reward. Now, in Trail of Cthulhu, I don't need that much plot or even characterization carrots--it's all there on the sheet. <i>Emotional states</i>, however, that would be awesome to bring it out. So my assignment was to think about a flashback scene of their PCs past with Jax, which would get played out in the next session. I'll give them a dedicated 1 or 2 point Stability pool (no refreshes) as a reward. I never require anybody to do the "homework", but I'm hoping one or two of them at least will want to; I'm going to ramp up the Stability stakes next session, so there should be a decent carrot there.<br/><br/>Thank you all for listening! I should have another session to go over in a couple of weeks (this was all one session, and we started late--system matters, for sure! I'd never have gotten so much done in my Pathfinder game.) Special thanks indeed to Bill for his astute comments; as a newbie to ToC, I really appreciate it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407693/#Comment_407693" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-01T11:28:57+00:00" title="March  1, 2013 11:28AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't currently have the spoons to give this thread the full reading it deserves (currently at the last of several conventions more or less in a row, and helping a friend at this one while being semi-on call for folks at Intercon, on the opposite coast), but I'm glad you're doing this.

Pete, a fellow veteran of the war, has been helpful in keeping Will on the straight and narrow the last several years. After gently chiding Will for not going to church lately, Pete takes him into his office.<br/><br/>Will discusses the events of the last few days, and how helpless he felt to not be able to rescue yet another friend. Pete counsels him to go to Jackson\u2019s wake. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault all those men died in France, and it\u2019s not your fault that the woman died.

His older brother Anton is there, and chides Alphonse for not coming to Temple, not visiting him more often, and also for not robbing Freddie Blakely blind, like they thought he was going to do. Alphonse insists that he has left the criminal life behind him, although Anton entreats him to rejoin him on the opposite side of the law.<br/><br/><i>[Likewise; I liked this a bit more, because it introduced a new NPC that I hadn't thought about much, Anton Gilbert.

Steele details the peregrinations of Elias from October 1924 through February 1925. Elias began the journal while in Shanghai, but trailed Jack Brady to Singapore. There she encountered a woman named Vanessa; this was apparently very shocking and she did not write for several days. When the journal picks up, she is in Cairo. Her stay there is brief; to throw off pursuit, she goes to Yemen.<br/><br/><i>[The following is a summary of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdlWjaJINS77hP8gm1zxU-weArgjUuCLxsLCcbrOeoM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Special Report prop</a> I made for the group. I also made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zse0mU3VVcISCf-hGc4bOCMwWKroRQp5-4eh1utL1o0/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">transcript of the journal itself</a>.</i><br/><br/>While in Yemen, she meets an old Bedouin woman who tells a strange story about three white men and a white woman walking out of the desert. Elias believes this to be Penhew, Huston, Brady, and Vanessa, and furthermore believes that they appeared in the desert by supernatural means.<br/><br/>From Yemen, she went to Paris, spending most of December in the city. She writes of being pursued by mysterious Arabs, and having a mental breakdown after seeing an ancient Egyptian bas-relief with the members of the Carlyle expedition engraved on it. She is given shelter by an old Army acquaintance, Frank, and his lover Georges, for several days while she tries to find a way out of the city. Frank has a contact, Mickey \u201cScoop\u201d Mahoney, who publishes an Irish-language paper and has extensive connections with the sort of people who could smuggle her out of France. (Elias believes him to be ex-IRA.) After Frank and Georges are murdered, she is flown out of Paris by Mahoney, spending a few days in London before going to Ireland to catch a steamer for Halifax.<br/><br/>In Canada, she tracks down a mysterious former sailor in Quebec, who fills her with dread about someone called \u201cThe Old Man.\u201d She sneaks across the border in Vermont, and then spends several days with her guardian, Dr. Henry Armitage, in Boston. Someone she only calls \u201cCharlie\u201d helps her find safe houses, and after swinging through the Bahamas she goes to ground in Philadelphia. She returns to New York after securing an interview with the Old Man, where she visited our heroes.<br/><br/>Steele concludes that Elias was mentally unstable, citing her \u201cselective aphasia\u201d (she claimed to have a recurring dream where a voice would shout in a language she could only recognize on waking; shortly thereafter, she would lose the ability to speak that language), claims to have spent the night in the Louvre on several occasions, being attacked by a painted backdrop of a Sphinx in the Paris Opera, and seeing an enormous flying serpent examining her ship; that last discovery is followed by a bizarre sequence where she claimed to have taken to a lifeboat, been picked up by a tramp steamer, and delivered to Halifax\u2014only to find, when she reached here connecting ship, that the purser insisted that she had brought her luggage aboard herself in the morning after arriving in Halifax on a liner.)<br/><br/>Steele also believes, however, that he has evidence that there was some kind of conspiracy that intended harm to Elias, and recommends that the investigation proceed out of channels.<br/><br/><i>[JE was definitely mentally damaged--she'd lost a ton of Sanity and Stability by the point she died. I'm still not sure myself if the encounter with the Hunting Horror really happened.]</i><br/><br/>The group has an immediate lead, thanks to the contents of the journal: a business card for Emerson Imports on the West Side, with the name \u201cSilas N\u2019Kwame\u201d scrawled on the back. (Other leads include a business card for Edouard Gavigan, of the Fondation Aubrey Penhew in Paris, a letter from Faraz Najir of Cairo to Roger Carlyle, and a flyer for a lecture by Dr. Anthony Cowles.) The group decides that they will at least try to follow up on the Emerson Imports lead; Will wants to find out what and who it was that killed Elias, for revenge and possibly redemption; Pearkes also has a debt of honor, and is concerned about threats to the Empire.<br/><br/>The wake is a surprisingly lavish affair; Mayor Walker is there, along with many of the city\u2019s elite. Will Blont notices that the predominantly African-American waitstaff is avoiding him and Gilbert, and eventually manages to speak to a waiter. The waiter disdainfully tells him that he isn\u2019t interested in being nice to the murderers of three black men, and that Jackson was popular in Harlem and his people want justice for her an the dead men. Blont tries to reason with him but the waiter eventually storms off.<br/><br/>Pearkes strikes up a conversation with the one man who is so rich that people are ignoring him\u2014this turns out to be the famous media overlord Charles Foster Kane. He knew Jackson when she was a young girl; every year, he brought some orphans out to his ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Elias got on famously with everyone and had the summer of her life; on her return to the orphanage in Connecticut, she talked so much about her time out West that the other girls disdainfully referred to her as \u201cJackson\u201d. Kane offers his considerable resources to the group to help find out who killed Elias, and why.<br/><br/>Pearkes gives a brief speech, recalling Elias on the Western Front, disguised as a litter bearer and picking up a machine gun to help pick off attacking Germans. While he talks, he remembers what actually happened that day: a shocked and frightened Elias, terrified of the hideous gunfire in No Man\u2019s Land, being ordered back behind lines by Pearkes. No sooner had he given the order, however, than Elias tackled him to the ground; just in time to avoid a walking barrage fired by the British artillery that fell woefully short.<br/><br/>Henry Armitage also tries to give a speech, but is too overcome by emotion. The group convinces him to pay a visit to the Golden Sentinel after the funeral the next day to discuss Elias, and especially the dagger she was so eager to acquire. the dagger she was so eager to acquire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410112/#Comment_410112" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T11:26:24+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 11:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: The Damned of the Earth (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>Elias\u2019 funeral is held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, still unfinished but an active church.

They were good boys, members of my church.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYou understand that I was just doing what I had to do, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI do, Mr. Doctor. And I will do what I have to do.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[And here we go. Making Mukunga M'Dari Blont's contact in the previous session was a spot of evil genius on my part, if I do say so myself. Making him a civil rights protester...that's cruel, which is a good thing in the Cthulhuverse.<br/><br/>It might be a bit of a stretch to insert a modern New York reaction into the 1920s, but hey, POST-MODERN and all. Plus, historically Marcus Garvey had just been sent to prison...]</i><br/><br/>In the middle of this altercation, Freddie Blakely shows up, still slightly inebriated after a bender that lasted several days. He sleepwalks through the service with great precision.<br/><br/>As the body is being carried out of the church, the Harlemites in the crowd protest and begin to shout \u201cJustice for Jackson!\u201d<br/><br/>Blakely, Pearkes, Blont and Gilbert motor down to the offices of the Sentinel with Dr. Armitage. As they arrive at the building, they find a crowd of African-Americans picketing the building, led by Mr. M\u2019Dari. Pearkes gets confrontational with the crowd, watched indifferently by several cops; clearly they have been ordered not to disperse the crowd, and as good sons of Ireland they enjoy watching a British officer get in over his head. Blakely invites M\u2019Dari to come upstairs later.<br/><br/><i>[I'll reiterate that I'm finding the presence of narrative space to explore the consequences of violence to be refreshing. Of course, this i undercut a bit by the players </i>knowing<i> that the accusations are groundless. I had hoped to play up one of the "cultists" as really having been an innocent dupe, but to paraphrase Napoleon, no prep survives contact with the PCs.]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Armitage, still grief-stricken, tries to answer the group\u2019s questions. He doesn\u2019t have any idea who was after Jackson, just that she was very afraid; she went on a bit of a bender while he was with her in Boston. Kane\u2019s men helped her hide after that. The dagger she was so interested in is very old, and it is believed that it could dispel Thoth when he took on flesh in one of his thousand forms. He knows a little about African and Egyptian cults but not much about Chinese ones\u2014he refers them to his colleague Dr. Cowles at Miskatonic.<br/><br/>As the interview is ending, Sheila bursts in. \u201cBoss, I think we\u2019ve got more trouble!\u201d Outside, the first stirring strands of a familiar march are beginning:<br/><br/>Arise ye workers from your slumbers<br/>Arise ye prisoners of want\u2026<br/><br/>Gilbert shudders slightly at the first notes of \u201cThe Internationale\u201d and tries to hide in a corner.<br/><br/><i>[Historically, at this time the Communist Party of the USA was the only other major organization (besides the NAACP) in the US concerned with civil rights. See</i> Invisible Man<i> for a far better exploration of this.]</i><br/><br/>Blakely goes down to meet the representatives of the Communist Party, USA\u2014a woman named Marion Goodhue, the Director of Public Events, and Sol Rosenberg, Director of Public Safety. He invites them and M\u2019Dari up to discuss the protest.<br/><br/><i>[Goodhue is Diane Keaton from </i>Reds<i>, natch.]</i><br/><br/>Things soon degenerate into a shouting match. Goodhue, a dedicated socialist from a wealthy family, demands that Blakely admit that he was behind the assassination of the three men in the hotel room and also behind the white slavery ring: \u201cYou\u2019re the spider in the middle of this web of intrigue!\u201d she sputters. Blakely laughs openly at this and Goodhue sheepishly admits that might be going a bit far.<br/><br/>Rosenberg turns out to be less a socialist and more of a Zionist; one of the best things about the party, he avers, is that he gets to finally fight back against WASPs. (Indeed, he had left a party of his all Jewish security force at the entrance, lead by Moishe \u201cThe Bear\u201d, who of course totes a baseball bat.) Pearkes snidely points out that Palestine is a British mandate and will stay so for years. Soon he and Rosenberg are shouting at each other, joined by M\u2019Dari. When Pearkes points out that M\u2019Dari is a subject of the British Empire, M\u2019Dari snorts that he has always declined that honor, and that he is from Kenya, not the Protectorate of East Africa. Goodhue angrily joins in, assuring Pearkes that socialism is the way of the future and that the Soviet Union will be the master of the world in fifty years; Pearkes retorts that it will be the British Empire that is still dominating the planet in 1975.<br/><br/><i>[Couldn't resist the Tarantino callback; I should be better than that. Rosenberg is a character that could definitely show up later, as one path could lead the PCs through Palestine...<br/><br/>PP was really playing up the Chauvinist Servant of the Empire here. I would have liked a lighter touch, but he does play it up really well.]</i><br/><br/>Blakely invites M\u2019Dari back to his office to discuss things with less noise. He is disappointed to find out that M\u2019Dari is merely presenting a list of demands; he knows, he tells Freddie, that there was a third shooter in the hotel room and he plans to expose the entire affair. Blakely sends all the protesters back out, and then asks his secretary Sheila to make sure the demonstrators have something warm to drink.<br/><br/><i>[FP is a master of deflection, as the next installment will show; I'm glad I created too many NPCs for this session, as he was good at defusing </i>all<i> of them.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410113/#Comment_410113" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T11:32:07+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 11:32AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, by this point I had sprung my CPUSA surprise, which I had been chomping at the bit to make go off since the last session. However, I think there were some issues here.<br/><br/>We hadn't really done anything mechanical yet; this was one of those "we didn't touch the dice for hours" things. Now, that's not horrible--in fact, it can be great, if the RPing is good, and it was here.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, the mechanics are how we distinguish the PCs from each other beyond the quality of their RPing. Also, and this is more specific to Trail, the mechanics have an important role in spotlight management. Without using the mechanics, it's easy for a magnetic player like FP to dominate the spotlight, especially since I truly enjoy playing off of him. (As it was, FP was late to the session--didn't arrive until the point in the narrative when Freddie gets there. You can see how much the subsequent events revolve around him. This is not in the slightest a knock on FP, who's a terrific gamer and damn interesting person, just a piece of evidence to support what I said about the mechanics.)<br/><br/>I blame my prep to some degree; I didn't keep my Investigator Matrix nearby when coming up with the situations for the next session, and I think that made them all a bit similar. (I try hard not to come up with plot, just encounters and situations; an example will be in the next installment.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410381/#Comment_410381" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T10:19:21+00:00" title="March 25, 2013 10:19AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: The Damned of the Earth (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>Meanwhile Charleston Chiu, after a five-day reading binge on the books he received from Erica Carlyle, is stepping outside Brenda\u2019s Diner in Harlem, nose pressed into an ancient tome. A middle-aged man in a wool coat, with a slight Irish burr in his voice, identifies himself as Lt. Frank Poole, Midtown Precinct, and asks Chiu to come with him to answer some questions. Chiu pays no notice until two of Poole\u2019s officers arrest him.<br/><br/><i>[Frank Poole is a relatively benign NPC in the original campaign, so I thought I'd make him a bit darker. Having him played (in my mind) by a </i>L. A. Confidential<i> era James Cromwell helped.<br/><br/>There was, as I've mentioned, a huge hole in the PCs' story--there was a third shooter, quite obviously, and it wouldn't take much legwork to identify Chiu as the triggerman.]</i><br/><br/>They drive downtown, and Chiu notices that they drive through Midtown, eventually stopping in an abandoned store on the boundary between Chinatown and Little Italy. Chiu is led inside and handcuffed to a chair. Standing in the room in his shirtsleeves is Lt. Brian Halloran, NYPD, Chinatown precinct.<br/><br/>\u201cWell, well, if it isn\u2019t our old friend Taffy. How you doing, Chewy?\u201d<br/><br/>Chiu looks around. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[CP has a knack for doing what isn't expected. Later, good storyteller that he was, he decided to go through with the beating because the plot seemed to demand it; that was nice of him. I'd have been more or less willing to let him walk away intact, although it would have cut off some nice content I had planned.]</i><br/><br/>\u201cGood,\u201d says Poole, pulling up a chair. \u201cWe know you were the third shooter, Mr. Chiu. The clerk at the hotel identified you. Now, tell me your relationship with Jackson Elias, and this white slavery racket.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThere was no slavery ring! I knew Elias from a year ago. I helped her find a man who had a trumpet that made the dead come back to life\u2026\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be straight with me\u2026\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cNo, it\u2019s for real! The trumpet was magic! She was on the run from some kind of cult\u2026\u201d<br/><br/><i>[The actual conversation was a bit longer than this, but that was the gist; CP gave up on trying to convince the cops to let him go and just went with the truth, no matter how ridiculous it was.]</i><br/><br/>Poole sighs, and swivels his chair around. \u201cAll right, Brian, I\u2019m turning my back.\u201d<br/><br/>Halloran smacks Chiu in the stomach, hard. Using his skill at the martial arts, Chiu kicks Halloran hard. This enrages the burly cop, and he proceeds to lay a pounding on the hapless sometime reporter.<br/><br/><i>[At last, some die rolls! Charleston probably could have pulled this off, but he was rolling terribly and not putting enough points in his Scuffling tests to guarantee success. (A 3-point buy would have done it, and he has Scuffling north of 8). Also, when he did hit, he rolled poorly for damage. I'd been letting him Kick for -1 to reflect his martial arts training, but as he was handcuffed to a chair I reduced that to the normal -2 for an unarmed strike. Halloran, on the other hand, didn't take any penalties to damage because Chiu was an easy target. I then proceeded to roll consistent 5s and 6s for his damage; Halloran put enough into his rolls to always hit.</i><br/><br/>\u201cTell us what you know! We know you used to work for Mr. Lee! Tell us the truth!\u201d<br/><br/><i>[Mr. Lee was Charleston's former Triad godfather; he was kicked out of the Triad at the conclusion of </i>Dead Man Stomp<i>.]</i><br/><br/>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything!\u201d<br/><br/>Halloran kicks Chiu hard, and he blacks out.<br/><br/>Freddie Blakely gets a call from his old friend \u201cFrothy\u201d down at the bank. \u201cFreddie, old bean, just thought you should know\u2014Pater\u2019s been talking to some Sotheby\u2019s people about your claim that they sold you the wrong dagger, and, well, sorry to break it to you, old man, but you\u2019re skint. Your accounts have been frozen until this all gets sorted out, and I think they\u2019ve sent an investigator up to your apartment.\u201d<br/><br/>Blakely and Gilbert race to the Dakota on the Upper West Side, Freddie\u2019s residence. They meet with a Sotheby\u2019s inspector, who has been poking around the place. Freddie quickly disarms him by saying it was all a mistake, he has the right dagger, and dash it all he just forgot to tell his man of business about it.<br/><br/><i>[I had hoped that this would be an interesting chain of events, with the Sotheby's investigator being an annoying recurring character. Of course, FP immediately deflected it, so I gave up somewhat meekly. Wasn't worth pursuing it as a point, and I had a lot of other annoyances to throw their way.<br/><br/>I felt justified in throwing both the interrogation scene and the Sotheby's investigation at CP and FP because they took Bad Luck as their drives. Let the hosing commence.]</i><br/><br/>Gilbert goes down to get the car. As he leaves the building, a mysterious man in a trenchcoat, hat pulled low on his head, beckons him into an alley. This proves to be a Communist agent he knew slightly back in France; in those days, he called himself Herbst or Primtemps; now he is known as October.<br/><br/>\u201cYou may not remember me, Mr. Gilbert, but we remember you. Some of us in the Party remember well your work in the Paris Soviet. We also remember that it was crushed in two days, and financed by a capitalist, Freddie Blakely. And now you work for that man. Those of us in the NKVD are not sure where your loyalties lie, Mr. Gilbert.<br/><br/>\u201cHistory is dead; it now exists only in the memory of the Party. You will watch this man Blakely, Mr. Gilbert, and report back to us. I\u2019ll be seeing you again soon.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[I had hoped October would have a bigger part in this session, but as it was there was too much going on. No worries; I think a NKVD assassin following the PCs around will be some excellent plot stew.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410384/#Comment_410384" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T10:34:15+00:00" title="March 25, 2013 10:34AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2013 10:48AM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: The Damned of the Earth (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Pearkes, Blakely, Blont and Gilbert head over to the West Side to meet with Arthur Emerson, of Emerson Imports. \u201cJackson Elias? That girl in the papers\u2014say, aren\u2019t you the guys who saved her?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes,\u201d says Blont sheepishly.<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry for your loss. She came by asking about some imports I did for Carlyle, and some things I brought in from Africa. I send most of those up to Silas N\u2019Kwame in Harlem, at a place called the Ju-Ju House, 137th near Lenox.\u201d<br/><br/>He pauses. \u201cBut whenever I need a provenance or an appraisal, I contact a professor up at Columbia, a [mild racial slur for a female person of sub-Saharan African ancestry]. Let me just ring her up\u2026.Hello? Muriel? I have some gentlemen who want to see you? Yes, this afternoon will be fine.\u201d<br/><br/>The four men leave Emerson Imports and head to the Ju-Ju House, a dusty storefront in a derelict-filled courtyard. Mr. N\u2019Kwame, the proprietor, is an elderly East African. He doesn\u2019t know Elias; he does sell African items from Emerson Imports.<br/><br/>Blakely notices that N\u2019Kwame has a key around his neck and filches it when his attention is caught by Pearkes, who is impatient with the interrogation. Literally lifting N\u2019Kwame off the floor, he demands to know about the three men who were killed. They were from the neighborhood; who did they know?<br/><br/><i>[PP went full metal aggro on this one, I think to the discomfort of the other PCs (let alone players). It wasn't helping that much, as N'Kwame clammed up pretty soon, and it marked Pearkes as being hostile to the cult. This had consequences later on.]</i><br/><br/>N\u2019Kwame sputters out that they all went to the same church, but grows evasive about its location and refuses to say anything more until he is put back down. Freddie comes around the counter, nearly tripping on a seam as he does so: a trap door. He calms down Pearkes and gets the quartet to leave the store; then he comes back in, gives N\u2019Kwame his key back, and manages to get the elderly man to reveal that the church is in a basement. Too late he realizes his mistake, and clams up; Blakely buys some trinkets at inflated prices to mollify him.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance buy from Freddie, one of the few Investigative buys in this session. See above for why I think that was a bad thing. I've taken to carting around the booklet that comes with the Keeper's screen so I can internalize ability use and buys.]</i><br/><br/>Blont and Gilbert decide to find a vacant apartment where they can watch the store; Pearkes and Blakely go to Columbia to visit the professor Arthur Emerson mentioned. This turns out to be Muriel Khadijja Mwimbe, a Zanzibari associate professor of anthropology. Dr. Mwimbe confirms that the dagger is ancient, and that East African death cults, descended from the legends of the Black Pharaoh of Egypt (\u201cAfter all, the Egyptians were Africans,\u201d she notes) believed that it could kill the Black Wind, the mysterious and evil manifestation of the god. At least his current form; the god could return later. Pearkes strikes some sparks with her and she is pointed about referring to the rape of Africa by the Europeans. Still, the interview ends on a good note; Blakely asks her to analyze the Dagger of Thoth, which is being kept at Sotheby\u2019s. He wants to know if the metal is unusual.<br/><br/><i>[Dr. Mwimbe will be a rather pivotal NPC. More I cannot say right now.]</i><br/><br/>Downtown, Chiu wakes up next to Halloran. His forehead displays a neat bullet hole, and his empty eyes stare back at Chiu. Poole presses a gun into Chiu\u2019s hands. \u201cSorry, Taffy, but this solves too many problems for me. I\u2019ll see you in the funny papers.\u201d<br/><br/>Left alone, Chiu manages to crawl out of the Little Italy side of the store. Some boys are playing ball, and they watch him in shock.<br/><br/><i>\u201cE morto?\u201d</i><br/><br/><i>\u201cNon, il non e morto. Va a il Fortunado.\u201d</i><br/><br/>Chiu blacks out again. When he comes too, he is on a table in the back of a restaurant. A young, well-dressed man is standing over him, slapping him gently on the face. \u201cCharlie, I think he\u2019s awake.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cGreat, Meyer. What\u2019re gonna do with a live [racial slur] and a dead cop.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to call the Cleaner.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[Yes, Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, when they were just starting out. I gave Lansky a rather sing-song voice, sorta like Horshach but less guttural; I was going for the contrast between his mild-mannered voice and his status as the kind of guy who would order a hit on one of his oldest friends, as he did years later with Bugsy Siegel.]</i><br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reach him, he\u2019s uptown somewhere. Bumpy will send a runner.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cTo think, a police did this! Animal! We should have left Russia for this?\u201d<br/><br/>Uptown, a young kid climbs into the vacant apartment where Blont and Gilbert are on watch. \u201cYou Mister Gilbert? The Fortunate One needs you. And bring a doctor. One who don\u2019t talk.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[A bit ham-handed, but I wasn't expecting them to go for the immediate stakeout. No harm done overall, I think.]</i><br/><br/>They tip the kid well and ask him to have his friends watch the place until they get back.<br/><br/>Once they get downtown, Charlie Luciano and Meyer Lansky meet them. Luciano sends Gilbert off to make the cop\u2019s body disappear, and Blont gets to work on Chiu. Luckily, his beating was administered by a professional; with a little patching up, he is out of serious danger and soon feels better once hopped up on pain meds. Blont, watching Gilbert periodically return with buckets of bleach and a bloodstained axe, wonders aloud what he has gotten himself into.<br/><br/><i>[I let Chiu get healed back to full even though it violated the rules, justifying it by saying Halloran was a professional who knew how to beat you to the edge of serious injury. (If you take away the effective +2 I gave him, then it's more or less kosher.) <br/><br/>That was probably bad form, but I knew they had a big combat encounter at the end and I wanted the New York Chapter to have training wheels attached. They've decided to go to Cairo next, which is probably the deadliest chapter, so I'll get some nice horror out of the contrast.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410572/#Comment_410572" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T09:58:31+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  9:58AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: The Damned of the Earth (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>At the Dakota, Pearkes, his fiancee Constance, and Blakely enjoy a nice dinner. Before desert can be served, the front desk rings up. \u201cSorry Mr. Blakely, I\u2019ve had to send up two gentlemen from the Bureau of Investigation who want to talk to you.\u201d Shortly after that, there is a knock on the door and the two agents, Gil Anderson and David Dukes, step into the apartment.<br/><br/><i>[Yeah, yeah, I know. I couldn't resist naming the BOI agents thus.]</i><br/><br/>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Blakely. We\u2019re investigating the Red involvement in this Elias affair. According to our records, you were detained as a Communist supporter by the British authorities.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cGoodness, that old thing? That was all the doings of my aunts, they were upset about me wanting to run off and marry that Elias girl. Everything was cleared up.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIs that so? Then how do you explain that you employ a known Communist agent, Mr. Alphonse Gilbert?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cFonzie? Why, he\u2019s given that all up and gone straight. Good monarchist like I am. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I must get back to my guests. Good evening.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Blakely, and we\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[This was designed to be another monkey wrench thrown straight at Freddie's Bad Luck. Not much came of it in this session, but Hoover may easily decided to keep these guys on his tail.]</i><br/><br/>Dinner finished, Blakely, Pearkes and Constance plan to step out to a club in Harlem where they will be close to Blont and Gilbert, who have returned to their surveillance post. Freddie hears a dull thud from the balcony in the music room. He steps inside to investgate.<br/><br/>A huge serpentine head crashes through the window, mouth full of razor sharp teeth. As it bites deeply into his shoulder, the rest of its body squeezes through the window\u2014a loathsome, livid flying serpent, two horrible batlike wings not seeming to support its uncanny height off the ground.<br/><br/>Keeping his composure, Freddie hightails it out of the room and slams the door behind him. \u201cI think we better all leave,\u201d he shouts.<br/><br/>From the music room comes a cacophonous noise that sounds as if a grand piano had been tossed against a wall.<br/><br/>Constance screams. The tip of a scaly tail punches through the wall and wriggles sickeningly in the air.<br/><br/>The three of them run downstairs. Police soon arrive; when they go up to the apartment, it looks as if several grenades have gone off. Several of the interior walls have been completely destroyed, and a grand piano is smashed as if it had been thrown at the wall with great force.<br/><br/>The smell of excellent quality liquor permeates the air\u2014the last vestiges of Freddie\u2019s extensive wet bar.<br/><br/><i>[Hunting Horror summoned by Mukunga to scare/slay Freddie, and distract the investigators. Freddie got away via a Flee roll; he wisely took quite a bit of Fleeing.]</i><br/><br/>The cops take everyone into custody. Blakely tries to tell his story: \u201cWell you see, somebody threw an exploding serpent into my apartment\u2026\u201d but that just gets him thrown into a holding cell. A sympathetic detective tries to get Pearkes to talk, saying he\u2019ll let Constance go if he does, but Pearkes rather starchily blows him off. Muttering something about this being just like the Rising, the detective orders Constance taken away by the matrons.<br/><br/>Freddie gets his call in to Bradley Grey. \u201cThis is serious, Freddie! The cops think the mob took a hit out on you! And the Bureau of Investigation is investigating you for subversive ties!\u201d<br/><br/>Pearkes calls the Embassy. \u201cWe\u2019re glad you finally rang in. Is Captain Steele with you? He hasn\u2019t checked in tonight.\u201d Some strings are pulled and Pearkes and Constance are released.<br/><br/>Grey gets Freddie off as well, but Blakely refuses to leave\u2014he asks to be put in their most secure cell. The cops shrug and lock him in with Wolf, a serial rapist they have apprehended.<br/><br/><i>[</i>Pour encourager les autres<i>, in the case of Sam.

The kids they hired tell them that other than a brief trip out and back by N\u2019Kwame, nobody has come in or out of the store.<br/><br/>They sit back to wait. Around 1 AM, people begin to walk in to the store, wearing their Sunday best. It\u2019s a mixed crowd, primarily African-American but also some white people. After a while, the sound of singing can be heard from underground. Chiu shakes his head\u2014the songs remind him of some of the things he\u2019s read in his books.<br/><br/><i>[CP raised an excellent question: is there any way to use Cthulhu Mythos as an Investigative skill without making a buy and risking sanity? I didn't really have an answer, although on reflection I think it might work to definitely identify things of as being of Mythos origin--"those tracks came from nothing on Earth!", that kind of thing.]</i><br/><br/>In a cell on the Upper West Side, Freddie\u2019s mind wanders back to the day he went to tell his aunts he was engaged to Jackson Elias. He recalls the day well; on the way in, he ran into his cousin Bertie.<br/><br/>\u201cHullo, Wooster.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cHullo, Blakely. What are you here for?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cSeeing the aunts.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cAh, you too. They\u2019re really on the warpath today. Oh, old man, thanks for that butler recommendation. This Jeeves fellow is a bit of a stiff, but should make a smashing butler. Definitely won\u2019t steal a man\u2019s socks.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cGlad to hear he worked out for you. I always found him dull and rather unintelligent.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[As noted above, I offered a small dedicated Stability pool for doing a flashback scene with Jackson Elias. This is Freddie's; PP took his during the wake. I thought FP would enjoy meeting Bertie Wooster.]</i><br/><br/>Inside the parlor, the aunts viewed Freddie with a terrible countenance.<br/><br/>\u201cFreddie, what\u2019s this about you getting married,\u201d asked Dahlia, who always had a soft spot for her wastrel nephew.<br/><br/>\u201cAnd an American! Explain yourself, Roland,\u201d thundered Agatha, who had a soft spot for nobody.<br/><br/>\u201cWell, you see, she\u2019s a reporter\u2026\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIn trade! Roland, what were you thinking.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh, Freddie\u2026\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWell, dash it, I suppose I\u2019m in love.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cNothing of the kind! Roland, you will break this engagement. You are to marry a woman worthy of your station. And if you refuse\u2026you will be cut off\u2026.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[As usual, the actual conversation went a bit longer. I distinguished the aunts by tone of voice and choice of address; Dahlia calls him Freddie, Agatha uses his given name.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes drops Constance off and swings by the Embassy. Nobody has seen Captain Steele for several hours. He calls the police, but they tell him to call back the next day.<br/><br/>He visits Steele\u2019s apartment, which is neat the way only the bachelor apartment of an ambitious staff officer can be. It does not look like anyone has been inside this evening. Steele\u2019s orange tabby cat rubs up against the Colonel\u2019s legs.<br/><br/>At the Ju-Ju house, the group have decided to try and sneak into the store. Hugging the shadows, they congregate in the courtyard. Just then, a car with British Embassy plates pulls up, and Colonel Pearkes steps out. He marches with military stiffness towards the store.<br/><br/><i>[And here PP decides to force things. Was it good or bad? It threw a heavy monkey wrench into the plans of the other players, and was a bit meta to boot--would Pearkes really suspect the cult first? On the other hand, it was nicely pulpy and pushed events to their climax...]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410577/#Comment_410577" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T10:14:39+00:00" title="March 27, 2013 10:14AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: The Damned of the Earth (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>\u201cStop!\u201d hisses Chiu. \u201cYou\u2019re going to let everyone know we\u2019re here.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThey have Steele. Duty first, old bean.\u201d<br/><br/>At that point, several of the passed-out derelicts who litter the courtyard stand up and charge the group. They are quickly dispatched by Pearkes\u2019 sword-cane and Gilbert\u2019s shotgun, but Chiu realizes the alert is sure to be raised. He runs out to fetch their (stolen) getaway vehicle, while the rest enter the store.<br/><br/>The trapdoor inside yields to Blont\u2019s deft hand with a lockpick. A flight of narrow stairs leads down into an inky darkness. Pearkes fishes out his electric torch and sprints down the stairs.<br/><br/><i>[BP wanted to jam the trapdoor so that it couldn't be opened from the outside, which became a minor plot point afterwards, although Charleston also has Locksmith.]</i><br/><br/>At the end of the hall is a door. Pearkes yanks it open and flashes his torch inside.<br/><br/>Bodies. Eighteen of them, their throats slit, lined up in neat geometric rows. They are wearing robes of some kind that he does not recognize.<br/><br/><i>[Stability Check! I shouted with glee once again this session. PP made almost all of his. I called for a lot more Stability checks this session, especially for things like Charleston's beating. I got a bit of pushback from the players, who questioned why hardened criminals...er, courageous heroes like themselves would need to make a check, but I stood my ground--I wanted to establish this for future sessions.]</i><br/><br/>Thrusting away the memories of ground actions in Belgium, Pearkes sidles into the room. To his right is a large winch, attached to a heavy circular stone lid about eight feet wide.<br/><br/>Gilbert looks inside and is horrified. He collapses shaking in the corridor. Afraid of suffering from another flashback, Blont keeps asking him what was inside that was so bad.<br/><br/>Pearkes continues to slide along the walls. Opposite the door to the room, he finds a curtained-off alcove. He glances inside, and sees four bodies propped up against the wall. He pushes aside the curtain and steps into the alcove just as Will and Gilbert step into the room.<br/><br/>And that\u2019s when the four bodies in the alcove spring into motion and attack him. From the back of the alcove he sees a lion-like face\u2014some kind of mask\u2014float towards him. He is pummeled by the undead and slashed by whatever is wearing the mask.<br/><br/><i>[I've mentally retconned Mukunga and N'Kwame as having been invisible during this time; makes more sense.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes backpedals out of the alcove, followed by the four corpses. Blont and Gilbert open up on the\u2014let\u2019s call them zombies\u2014and the deafening sound of gunfire fills the room. One zombie drops, but the rest still advance. The masked figure slashes at Pearkes, knocking the flashlight from his hands.<br/><br/><i>[The </i>Players<i> actually raised the point about their PCs being effectively deaf before I could. They are a good crew.]</i><br/><br/>A desperate struggle begins, lit only by the dim glow of the dropped torch and the muzzle flashes of their guns. Blont and Gilbert make a dash for the door, firing as they retreat. They hear the sound of the winch being activated, and even through the ringing in their ears they can hear a terrible moaning and screaming coming up from the pit.<br/><br/>Then the door slams shut behind them. Something heavy falls outside, barring it shut.<br/><br/>Chiu pulls up into the courtyard. He sees N\u2019Kwame dashing out of the front of the store, cackling madly. Chiu opens up with his Thompson and cuts the old man down. He races inside the store and manages to rip open the trap door.<br/><br/>Downstairs, Gilbert looks down into the pit and his mind reels with horror. At the bottom of it is a horrible purple worm, covered in human faces, each gibbering and screaming.<br/><br/><i>[Gilbert was the only one to get Shaken by the Mythos this session; he rolled particularly poorly on his Stability checks. Pearkes made his later on even though he had to deal with the gruesome supernatural murder of one of his Sources.]</i><br/><br/>Blont and Gilbert attack the door. Gilbert manages to wedge it open and Blont slips through. The lion-masked figure slashes at him as he leaves, not noticing Gilbert collapsed by the door. The Frenchman jams his sawed off against the mask and pulls the trigger, just as Pearkes finishes dispatching the last zombie.<br/><br/>Fingers shaking, Gilbert pulls the mask off of the body. He recognizes the face: Mukunga M\u2019Dari.<br/><br/>Blont comes running up the stairs and sees Chiu. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cGet in the car! The cops will be here soon!\u201d Chiu rushes past him and finds Pearkes examining the pit. His eyes fill with tears of horror and regret when he recognizes Sam Steele\u2019s face<br/>on the horrible creature. \u201cTime to use your dynamite, Charleston.\u201d<br/><br/>Grumbling, Chiu fishes out a stick of dynamite that he keeps in his trenchcoat. He throws it into the pit and they let the lid slam shut.<br/><br/><i>[If you know</i> Masks<i> you know this won't kill the Chakota.

I had each one make a check to combine their skills.]</i><br/><br/>The next morning Freddie steps out of the precinct, charges once again wiped clean. The Dakota has already rung him up, regretting to inform him that the damages to his apartment are so extensive that he can\u2019t stay there, which is just as well because they want him to leave.<br/><br/>There are no protesters outside the Sentinel when he arrives. He asks Sheila to look up the Goodhue woman\u2019s family and see if he can meet with them.<br/><br/>Freddie pays a visit to Dr. Mwimbe. She has analyzed the dagger and she thinks the metal is definitely not bronze, but she doesn\u2019t know what it is. Freddie, somewhat tactlessly, points out that she\u2019ll never get a real teaching position at Columbia; he offers her a grant, to do some research in Cairo. Maybe she can even return the dagger to its rightful place at the Museum of Antiquities. What do you say? In a few weeks?<br/><br/>Startled and flattered, the Professor agrees.<br/><br/>Having accomplished that, Freddie drops in on the Bureau of Investigation\u2019s field office. He meets Gil Anderson and tries to point him in the direction of several unsavory figures in various cults up in Harlem, and they have Red ties, don\u2019t you know? Gilbert looks uncomfortable at this point.<br/><br/>That night, he meets Marion Goodue\u2019s parents at a Broadway play. Yes, they are aware of their daughter\u2019s activities, and they do not approve. No, they don\u2019t approve of playboy Freddie either. Marion\u2019s already done everyone a favor and run off to Estonia or someplace like that. Now can we enjoy our play? The second act\u2019s about to begin.<br/><br/><i>[I can bring Marion back; I liked her, but in play I realized she only had one function, to yell at Freddie, so I didn't push her storyline.]</i><br/><br/>Late that night, MacKenzie, the \u201cUndersecretary for Foreign Affairs\u201d and MI-6 agent knocks on Pearkes\u2019 door. \u201cWakey wakey, gov. We\u2019ve got a VIP for you to meet.\u201d<br/><br/>He and two MPs drive out of the city via a specially chartered ferry, and then far out into the countryside of New Jersey, headed towards Lakehurst. Eventually they stop in a deserted field.<br/><br/>They wait in the frosty night. MacKenzie seems nervous.<br/><br/>Suddenly a spotlight lances through the blackness, from directly above. It swerves around, highlighting each of the men standing there. A faint sound of engines can be heard, and looking up Pearkes can just make out the lines of a dirigible. MacKenzie and the MPs moor the airship, and a gangplank descends.<br/><br/>A prim, middle-aged woman in a dress last stylish before the Great War slowly disembarks. MacKenzie gives his most military salute. \u201cMum,\u201d he croaks out.<br/><br/>\u201cAs you were. This is the Colonel. Very good, Colonel, you will convey us to New York.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cVery good, Mum,\u201d says MacKenzie as Pearkes helps her into the car. \u201cWe\u2019ll just find our own way back.\u201d<br/><br/>The long drive back is silent. At last they pull up to the Embassy. The woman, who seems to know the place very well, leads Pearkes deep into the basement. She opens a panel on one wall and it rolls back, revealing a room Pearkes never suspected existed.<br/><br/>Inside it is filled with obscure and occult gewgaws\u2014strange fetuses in jars, old books, skulls, alembics, and many other things. \u201cAt least they put in the electric,\u201d sniffs the woman. She adjusts the long red scarf she keeps tightly wrapped around her neck. \u201cThe last time I was here we were still using gas. Sit down, Colonel.\u201d<br/><br/>She regards him from across a table. \u201cYou may call me M. I am used to working with people of rather\u2026more unique talents than yours. Still, we must make use of the tools at our disposal. You are aware now that threats of a most unusual nature exist in this world?\u201d<br/><br/><i>[Right around this point, FP chimed in: "Wait...is she wearing a scarf tightly wrapped around her neck?"<br/><br/>"As a matter of fact, [FP], she is."<br/><br/>"Oh, my...." chuckles.<br/><br/>PP hasn't read</i> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen<i> and so wasn't in on the joke initially.]</i><br/><br/>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. We disposed of one this evening with dynamite.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cAre you sure? Did you check?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cUh, no ma\u2019am.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWere I you, Colonel, I would make that my first order of business.\u201d She paused, and took out a dossier and put on a pince-nez. \u201cYou have been assigned to a special branch of the intelligence services. It will not show on any records. I will be your direct supervisor. Do you understand?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. What are my orders?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cTrack down the people behind the murder of Miss Elias. Neutralize their threats to the Empire. Now come with me, Colonel. I will be taking different transportation from here.\u201d<br/><br/>She opens a door in the back of the room and steps out into a network of tunnels. After a long time, they climb out near the East River piers. They stroll to the end of a dock.<br/><br/>Out in the river, a British submarine surfaces and slowly moves under the dock.<br/><br/>\u201cThank you Colonel, and good luck.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThank you ma\u2019am. And may I say, you have a remarkable sense of style.\u201d<br/><br/>M pauses on the ladder to the sub. \u201cI have been accused of many things, Colonel, but that is one of the few that is true.\u201d<br/><br/><i>[Verbatim exchange, and kinda cool.]</i><br/><br/>As she clambers down into the submarine\u2019s hatch she pauses again. \u201cThis Mr. Blakely. Do you trust him?\u201d<br/><br/>After an instant, Pearkes replies, \u201cIn some things.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cRead him in. Good-bye, Colonel. Don\u2019t try to reach me\u2014I\u2019ll reach you.\u201d<br/><br/>Shaking his head, Pearkes makes his way up to the Sentinel, where Freddie has just arrived.<br/><br/>\u201cSheila? Can you come in here?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c\u2026Mr. Blakely?\u201d She enters the room with trepidation\u2014he\u2019s used her name twice in a week! Something big must be up.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat do you say you come with me off to Cairo?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWhat? Yes, Mr. Blakely!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThat\u2019s a girl.

I stuck Mina Harker in there because I had used her in a previous, Cthulhu-esque Risus one-shot, and because I couldn't resist. This is obviously not the world of the <i>League</i>, but Moore and I share a bit of a grab-bag approach to sticking allusions into our plot. Also, he's a better writer than me, and certainly has a better beard.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, MH gives me a convenient plot handle to stir things up whenever they get stuck. And I could see, in some alternate plotline from <i>League</i>, Mina Harker eventually becoming M, or at least the M of the League.<br/><br/>After this session, BP told me he would be dropping out, mostly because of conflicting playstyles. I was a bit sorry, because I thought Will was the best "audience-identification" PC in the game. Still, both BP and I had played together in a group where the players not only had clashing styles, but the GM's style clashed with all of them, so I wasn't going to try to plead for him to stay with something that wasn't working on his end. (As I like to say back when we were in the other group, "This is my hobby; I shouldn't have to work so hard for it.")<br/><br/>I'm seeing BP tonight and should get a more detailed explanation of what is up, although my suspicion is that PP's style was the main factor. I had tentatively tagged BP as a "Method Actor" in Robin Laws' classification, though, so I wouldn't be surprised if FP was also a source of tension. Or maybe I'm just a bad GM! The possibilities are sadly not limitless...<br/><br/>The group decided to head off to Cairo next. I was a bit surprised; I figured they'd go for Paris first, but I didn't sell those clues as hard as I could have. Cairo will be an interesting time no matter what, of course; it's also the deadliest section in the campaign, or can be, in my opinion; Shakhti can be a murderously efficient opponent. When I played Masks, he was underplayed by the Keeper and still this section was a rough go for us, and that was with us laying an ambush for the Clive expedition. (Our motto was, "Shoot the sorcerer first, and then shoot him several more times after he goes down.")<br/><br/>Based on the time they'd reasonably arrive in Egypt, they're going to be smack dab in the middle of the Parliamentary Elections of 1925. This resulted in a Parliament that was eventually dismissed by the King, and so there will be plenty of unrest. Which I will dig. It's becoming clear to me that one of the themes I'm playing up more than in the straight Masks is Imperialism; the Egypt chapter will be a great place for this. (The other themes, feminism and LGBTisms, will wait for other sections.)<br/><br/>I mostly took from this session a determination to try and tailor the challenges in terms of the group's abilities, instead of just being interesting in of themselves.

"Mary Rider," he says. "You want to find out about Jackson? Mary Rider."<br/><br/>Pearkes has the embassy staff chase down the name. A Mrs. Mary Rider recently vanished on her way home from the docks on North River; she had been away on holiday.<br/><br/>Pearkes treks out to the Rider household, a first-floor apartment in a Chelsea brownstone. Mr. Rider isn't much help; all he knows is that his wife never came home from her trip. According to the police, a cab dropped her off in front of the building, but she never arrived.<br/><br/>Pearkes does notice a family portrait of the Rider family; Mrs. Rider is a pretty brunette who bears a resemblance to Jackson Elias.<br/><br/>Chasing down the name of the cabbie from the police records, Pearkes brings Freddie out to Bensonhurst to meet the man. On the way over, Freddie tells Pearkes about how a woman who looked like Jackson met him on the docks the day he went to meet Elias; she gave him the message that Jax would see him at the charity ball that night.<br/><br/>Seamus, the cabbie, is none too happy to see two British gentlemen, one in Army uniform, show up at his door. Freddie lays on the charm, getting a grudging amount of respect from the hack. He doesn't know much--like he told the police, he dropped the lady off--but he does say that he saw a beat-up Ford following him, driven by two black men. Pearkes and Blakely exchange looks--was the cult involved?<br/><br/>That evening four policemen pay a call on the offices of the <i>Golden Sentinel</i>. As it turns out, they are security for Erica Carlyle. Her bodyguard, Joe Corey, has been killed, and people have broken into her house. She's going into hiding. She is surprised to hear that Freddie is heading for Cairo, and she tells him that if he's determined to follow up on Roger, he should look for his former agent, Warren Besart. She also mentions that her beau, Bradley Grey, is running for District Attorney next year, and he'd appreciate any help Freddie can give him. Freddie gladly agrees, and donates a check to Grey.<br/><br/><i>[Credit Rating buy by Freddie; I told FP that he'd be able to call on favors in New York.]</i><br/><br/>The next day they set sail from New York. Freddie of course rates the Imperial Suite, with Alphonse in adjacent servants' quarters; Pearkes settles into a first-class cabin, and Charleston vanishes somewhere below decks.<br/><br/><i>[CP couldn't make this session, so Charleston is rather unusually passive this session!]</i><br/><br/>The first day at sea, Alphonse runs into his brother Anton, much to his surprise. Having lifted somebody's tickets, Anton is on his way to Cairo to help out his brother--he speaks Arabic, a legacy of his posting in North Africa during the war--and to maybe clean up a bit at the ritzy hotels Freddie will be staying at.<br/><br/><i>[Naked Source of Stability preservation, of course; Freddie brought Sheila, his source, and Pearkes his elkhound MacDonald.]</i><br/><br/>On the way over, MacDonald becomes listless and sick. The ship's veterinarian thinks it is just seasickness. Pearkes studies Egyptology to give him a basic familiarity.<br/><br/><i>[Creative Library Use buy by Pearkes--which I promptly didn't reward.

Boats surround the steamer, hawking wares and advertising hotels and tour services. Sheila had long ago made arrangements, and the group ensconce themselves at Claridge\u2019s, the best hotel in town.<br/><br/><i>Thursday, 12 March 1925</i><br/><br/>Pearkes checks in at the local garrison. Not much of note is happening, although with the parliamentary elections approaching, the British are preparing for an unstable political situation. Pearkes takes the time to find out the locations of oases and supply depots from Alexandria to Port Said.<br/><br/>He does learn that locals are avoiding the catacombs of Kom El Shaqafa, speaking nonsense about some kind of "white ghost."<br/><br/>Meanwhile Freddie hires a dragoman and takes a tour of the city with Alphonse. They stop at Kom El Shaqafa, but Freddie notices his guide's nervousness. "Hasan, my man, what is it you're worried about?"<br/><br/>"Sahib, this place has become haunted by a ghul. It comes out at night and attacks goats and sheep. My cousin Hasan told me his neighbor's sister's child was killed by this terror, may Allah strike it down."<br/><br/>"I say! Well then, we should probably leave, don't you think? You know, I've always wanted to try some of this Egyptian coffee I've heard about."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"You are in luck, sir! My other cousin Hasan runs the best teahouse in all Alexandria! I will take you there!"<br/><br/>Freddie and Alphonse spend a pleasant day enjoying the world's strongest tea and the completely legal hashish available in cousin Hasan's teahouse.<br/><br/>Late that night Pearkes rouses Freddie and Alphonse, and they trek out to the catacombs. Pearkes discovers a clear set of tracks that lead from the catacombs and out into the Old Quarter. Examining the gate to the tombs, Gilbert chillingly discovers that it has been unlocked--from the inside.<br/><br/>The group descend into the catacombs. Pearkes follows a trail down into the third level, which is partially flooded. He finds a tunnel that has signs of having been used often in the recent past, and they make their way down it, squeezing past a part that is completely underwater.<br/><br/>At the end of the tunnel they find a small chamber. The remains of a tiny fire is in one corner, and the walls are blackened with soot. A horse blanket is tossed in one corner and shows signs of having been used to sleep on. One one wall, Freddie discovers a portrait of Isis that hasn't been damaged by the smoke. Something about it bothers him. With a start, he realizes that he recognizes the face: Hypatia Masters.<br/><br/><i>[Art History buy by FP; not a detail I prepped, but it fits in with my plans for Masters, which are very different from Larry DeTillo's.]</i><br/><br/>Alphonse goes through the blanket, and finds a couple of old books, all dating from the early 19th century. Most are trashy novels, with <i>Frankenstein</i> being the sole exception.<br/><br/>Suddenly they hear a noise from the tunnel.

Pearkes stations himself by the door. The room goes pitch black.<br/><br/>Something comes through the doorway.<br/><br/>Pearkes grabs it, wrestling it down. Freddie lights the lantern.<br/><br/>They see a pale faced young man, dressed in breeches, a frilly white shirt, and a cape. All his clothes are rather shabby and falling apart.<br/><br/>"Don't hurt me, don't hurt me! Who are you?"<br/><br/>"Calm down old man. We're here to help. What's your name?"<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance buy by Freddie.]</i><br/><br/>"Me? I'm...I'm...John. William? No. John. That's what they called me. Wait. Something else. Doctor. I'm a doctor."<br/><br/>"Do you have a last name?"<br/><br/>"Pol...Per...Pally...Polidori! That's me, Doctor John Polidori!"<br/><br/>"And what are you doing here?"<br/><br/>"I went away. The Master told me to go away, and I went. He told me to forget, and I forgot."<br/><br/>"And who is this master fellow?"<br/><br/>"He's the Master! He's the oldest one. He made me, long ago."<br/><br/>This goes on for a while. John came from the south, from Victory, wherever that was. He had gone to see the Master for some reason, and it amused the Master to drive him insane and dress him in this ridiculous fashion. John has been living here for some time, surviving on the blood of animals and his memory.<br/><br/>"There was me, and Mary, and...ship guy, who orders ships? Admiral? Admiral's grandson. George. He let us call him George, not my lord. I was his doctor. This was long ago."<br/><br/>"Really? I say John, who was king back then?"<br/><br/>"George."<br/><br/>"Your friend?"<br/><br/>"No! Crazy George. Then his son, when I died."<br/><br/>"You...<i>what</i>, old man?"<br/><br/>"Died. I died. The Master made me then. Oh, I tried to die again. I hung myself for a day, but it didn't work. I shot myself, but I got better again. I can't die."<br/><br/>Freddie takes a closer look. John only inhales when he needs to talk. His skin is cold. Freddie checks for a pulse. He doesn't find any.<br/><br/>"Can you open your mouth?"<br/><br/>With a sinking feeling, Freddie examines the long fangs of John Polidori.<br/><br/><i>[Series of stability checks here. I charged Freddie for both figuring out that John was dead, and seeing the fangs, under the theory that it's one thing to expect it, quite another to actually see it.<br/><br/>For those of you not in on the joke, the vampire is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Polidori" rel="nofollow">John Polidori</a>, personal physician of Lord Byron and author of one of the first vampire novels in English--the only other book to come out of the famous contest that resulted in Mary Shelley's</i> Frankenstein<i>.]</i><br/><br/>Thoroughly disturbed, the group discuss what to do. Freddie feels the best thing to do is to ensure that John gets fresh blood every night, so that he won't terrorize people. Pearkes and Gilbert want to destroy him, but Freddie wins out.<br/><br/>"So, listen John, we'll arrange for you to have blood every day. How's that sound?"<br/><br/>"Oh good! Very good. Good to have blood. I've been so hungry for so long. Not having blood. Good blood. Blood like yours..."<br/><br/>"Er, right. Well...we'll be going then..."<br/><br/>"Yes. I think you should go. You should go right now. Go before I decide to <i>eat</i> you..."<br/><br/>Pearkes sticks the blade of his sword cane through John's head.<br/><br/><i>[I played up John's menace here--he'd hit the end of his ability to converse with Happy Meals on legs. Still, PP surprised everyone with his attack.]</i><br/><br/>A furious struggle breaks out. John turns out to be incredibly strong, seizing Pearkes and ravaging his neck. Gilbert and Freddie try to drag the vampire off of Pearkes, who starts to shoot the undead. Freddie squirts some lantern fuel on the vampire and then bashes him with the lantern, setting him on fire. Undaunted, John plunges his fangs into Freddie's neck, gleefully sucking down the arterial blood that splashes everywhere. Finally Gilbert and Pearkes manage to hack John's head off with the sword cane, ending the fight.<br/><br/><i>[Didn't really stat out John, just gave him a bunch of health and like Scuffling-12. His bite did 1d6 +3, which is a lot--he did something like 12 points to poor Freddie, and I brought back health as he drained Freddie. Bullets did less damage too. <br/><br/>I was surprised at the attack, but decided to make it my nervy fight of the session--we seem to have one per episode.

GP took some more First Aid as the group was now without a primary healer. They also lack a shrink; this might make a good NPC (and Source of Stability, natch.)]</i><br/><br/>Together, Pearkes and Gilbert manage to drag Freddie back to the surface. While Gilbert stands guard (they are on the edge of the Old City), Pearkes runs out to look for something to make a stretcher out of.<br/><br/>He tears down the awning in front of a shop--the poles and the awning cloth are perfect. Unfortunately, he makes enough noise to wake up the store's owner.<br/><br/><i>[In general, I've been allowing certain tasks to auto-succeed if the PC just has the skill; treating General abilities like Investigative abilities.

So much bad would come from this...]</i><br/><br/>The shop owner rushes outside to confront the colonel. Pearkes throws a ten-pound note at him, but the man just spits at it. He starts to scream in Arabic, causing a crowd to rapidly gather. Pearkes steps back and fires a shot in the air.<br/><br/><i>[And so we dig deeper. I was caught up in the moment, and was annoyed at Pearkes always trying to assert his superiority, so I escalated with the shopkeeper and then the crowd. Sure, it flowed naturally from the situation; but it was a huge mistake on a bunch of levels, as will become clear.]</i><br/><br/>A man steps out of the crowd, holding an ancient percussion rifle. "Put down your gun, English. We are tired of you coming and stealing from us."<br/><br/>Pearkes faces the sheikh down with his steely battlefield glare.<br/><br/><i>[Two-point Intimidation buy from PP.

As a player, he generally likes to have minions for his PC, and I was making him get in line behind everyone else.<br/><br/>--All that said, he was being the Big Damn Hero, the Unflappable Soldier who pulls off the impossible when everything is going to hell. And I dinged him for it, and then wouldn't back down.<br/><br/>--This was a major GM FAIL on my part; PP basically shut down after this, and I can see why: I was saying, essentially, that his character concept wasn't legitimate. Which is stupid.]</i><br/><br/>Despite his best attempts to head off the crowd, eventually Pearkes is surrounded and then delivered to the Egyptian Police nicely trussed up. The sheikh swears out a warrant against him, and eventually an officer from the base arrives to get him released.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Gilbert has managed to get some of the local children (roused by the near-riot) to run off and fetch a carriage to take them back to Claridge's.<br/><br/>Freddie, having been warned off of the local hospitals, has the hotel hire a doctor and round-the-clock nurses. He has Hasan the dragoman summon a local representative of the Wafd--the anti-British political party--to the hotel to discuss Pearkes' case.<br/><br/>The representative who comes turns out to be none other than Saad Zaghloul, the leader of the party and ex-Prime Minister. Zaghloul wants to use the incident to incite the party; the elections are a week away, and an anti-British incident will be useful. Freddie manages to convince him that a healthy donation to the Wafd will be gladly made, provided his friend Pearkes gets out of his jam. Zaghloul agrees, and Pearkes' charges are dismissed with a fine.<br/><br/>While Freddie recuperates, he is visited by Mustafa Pasha, the under-secretary of Cultural Affairs and a friend of King Faud. The pasha wants to use Freddie's injury as the royalist's own political incident: the assault on an innocent British civilian by the ruffians who rioted in the Old City. Freddie demurs gently, but manages to convince Mustafa he is on his side.<br/><br/>After a week, Freddie is well enough to make the trip to Cairo, and they take the train south, hoping to follow up on their slender leads: the names Omar Shakhti and Faraz Najir from Jackson's journal, and Erica's tip to find Warren Besart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412216/#Comment_412216" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-18T15:02:59+00:00" title="April 18, 2013  3:02PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>A man steps out of the crowd, holding an ancient percussion rifle.

As a player, he generally likes to have minions for his PC, and I was making him get in line behind everyone else.<br/><br/>--All that said, he was being the Big Damn Hero, the Unflappable Soldier who pulls off the impossible when everything is going to hell. And I dinged him for it, and then wouldn't back down.<br/><br/>--This was a major GM FAIL on my part; PP basically shut down after this, and I can see why: I was saying, essentially, that his character concept wasn't legitimate.

It can be hard when you feel like a player is steam-rolling you or hogging the spotlight, but sometimes you just have to live with it. Players play to be effectual: they want to make stuff happen. If stuff just happens <i>to</i> them, they might as well be reading a book or watching a movie. In any event, a better GM strategy in my experience is always to give the PCs enough rope to hang themselves. "Ah, ferengi dog, I will take your money because I deserve nothing less for the wrong you have done me--but you have made an enemy today!" Signal future badness, if you like.<br/><br/>Ah, well.

I don't think it destroyed the session, and I apologized to PP the next day and told him I'd been too hard on Pearkes. We also discussed his plans for George--he's not insensible to the fact that his beloved Empire is built on racism and exploitation--but hasn't reached snapping point yet.<br/><br/>I think there's some re-gearing on my part here, and a bit of trouble in grasping just exactly what the parameters of the Keeper's role are. In Pathfinder, my role was clear: cough up level-appropriate encounters and more or less be adversarial in conduct (if not intention; I'm a player's GM for the most part.)<br/><br/>And in Lady Blackbird, I'm content to more or less roll with things and occasionally add a little frustration of plans; when the crew of the Owl act like sociopaths, I just swallow it, and hope my incredulity speaks volumes :-) (Tongue in cheek; they want a sociopath murderhobo adventure, hey, I'm just there to ask questions.)<br/><br/>But in TOC I'm both adversary (and a very unfair adversary at that) and collaborator in the fiction. I'm having a bit of trouble sometimes adjusting to that. (That, and the usual GM complaint of always having too many balls in the air; for such a light system, I always seem to be on the verge of missing stuff.)<br/><br/>So I missed a clear player flag again, and the session was less awesome than it could have been. (It was still pretty awesome; I'm enjoying the Cairo section.)<br/><br/>In any case, Pearkes will get some minions next time, oodles of cultists to practice heroism against, and probably somebody to rescue. The Big Damn Hero package--ask your server.<br/><br/>FP talked to me a bit about the conflicting genres of the players--as he sees it, CP seems willing to try the dark-horror-with-a-humorous-bent thing, FP himself is doing genial social satire, GP seems to want to play a thriller, and PP wants to be an action hero. He (FP) asked me how tied I was to the horror theme--because pulp as a genre can handle all the modes listed above.<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly how to answer that. I mean, how much horror can you take from the adventure? One the one hand, Cthulhu is a horror game, explicitly; one the other, Lovecraft really wasn't all that...<i>scary</i>. <br/><br/>I replied that I was reaching around for dark pulp (heroes in a downbeat setting, victory possible but only with sacrifice) with a healthy mix of pulp horror (screaming, running around, heroes punching out supernatural baddies.) To be honest, if I can get the psychological state of the BSG reboot (the lodestar of the campaign, after all) I'll be plenty satisfied. Is that how the game has played out? I'm not sure. I mean, there's plenty of comedy with Freddie, and the fights have all been nervy and tense. So maybe? <br/><br/>Tailoring the game to the players is probably the definition of the art of the GM. I'm confident that I can pull it off--I more or less did with the same crew in the Pathfinder game--but it's important to continue to keep your trim.                        </div>\n<div

4)</b><br/><br/><i>21 March 1925</i><br/><br/>Safely ensconced in Shepheard's, the luxury hotel near the Ezbekia Gardens, the group gets down to chasing their leads. Freddie asks about Omar Shakhti, Faraz Najir, and Warren Besart with the concierge. The last two he promises to check in about, but the first name he knows immediately.<br/><br/>"Shakhti Bey? Yes, he is one of the richest men in Cairo. He has a great cotton plantation to the west of the city."<br/><br/>"Fantastic! Please send him a message saying I'd like to meet with him."<br/><br/>Pearkes checks in at the fort and meets General Allenby, the Lord Protector. He is disdainful of the Egyptians and regards the election as a major headache. He gives Pearkes a batsman, a young private. Pearkes tips him ten pounds.<br/><br/>"Cor bless you guv, you're the best officer I've ever had!"<br/><br/>Freddie and Alphonse accompany Dr. Mwimbe to the Egyptian Museum, where they meet with Dr. Ali Kafour, the head of the antiquities department. They talk about the Carlyle expedition--Dr. Kafour knew Sir Aubrey slightly, as he was a well-regarded Egyptologist.<br/><br/>According to Dr. Kafour, the Carlyle party dug at several locations, notably near the Sphinx, at Dhashur, where the Red Pyramid and the Crooked Pyramid are located, and then near Luxor--but not in the Valley of the Kings.<br/><br/>"And now the Penhew Foundation has sent a new expedition, headed by a Dr. Henry Clive. They are digging in the same area."<br/><br/>"Love to meet them, old man."<br/><br/>"I will try to introduce you."<br/><br/>"By the way, what can you tell us about that African woman travelling with them--what's her name, M'Weru?"<br/><br/>"Ah, the Nubian [gender slur]."<br/><br/>Dr. Mwimbe shoots him a dagger-like look.<br/><br/>"She was very foolish. Always wore a burial mask, although she was not Egyptian, being an ignorant East African."<br/><br/>Mwimbe spouts something in Swahili at the doctor, and he replies. After a moment's heated conversation, Dr. Mwimbe storms out, saying she will see them at the hotel.<br/><br/>"Dr. Kafour, do you know a place around here called Victory?" asks Freddie, remembering Polidori's rambling statement.<br/><br/>"Victory? You are in it! This is Al-Qahira--it means, 'The Victorious'."<br/><br/>The group exchanges glances--so "The Master" is in Cairo.<br/><br/>Freddie shows Kafour the Dagger of Thoth, saying he wants to donate it to the museum. The doctor is astonished--this is an artifact beyond price, he says.<br/><br/>He confirms that there was a belief that the dagger could kill the avatars of Thoth, although he says that Thoth has merely been associated with much older, darker gods. He explains that in the time of the Third Dynasty, an evil man named Nephren-Ka became king of Egypt--the legendary Black Pharaoh. Nephren-Ka was a sorcerer, and had a spirit called the Black Wind that could slay anyone anywhere in the land. These myths have passed down into East Africa as well.<br/><br/>While the group digests this information, Dr. Kafour gives a sudden shout of pain. He begins to convulse, clearly in the grips of a heart attack. Gilbert tries to help, but the state of the art of 1920s medicine isn't much help--Kafour expires.<br/><br/><i>[Hadn't planned this, but certain events made this make sense; Kafour is a font of useful information, and could be a powerful ally. Unfortunately, the PCs tipped off their opposition, and they decided to take out the doctor before he could talk more.]</i><br/><br/>Chastened, the group returns to the hotel. The concierge has some news. Shakhti Bey would be happy to receive them at their convenience. Faraz Najir is unknown to them; as for Warren Besart, he recommends they ask at the police station.<br/><br/>Freddie arranges for Sheila to be visited by a French dressmaker--she had been worried that she couldn't fit in with the dazzling crowd at Shepheard's, but she dearly wants to go dancing that night. While Gilbert stays behind to offer up his professional assessment as a Frenchman, Freddie and Pearkes go down to the hall of records to learn more about Shakhti.<br/><br/>It turns out, by an interesting coincidence, that except for routine tax records, all dispatches or intelligence files on Shakhti were destroyed in a fire. Two separate fires, actually, at the same warehouse.<br/><br/>"Really should find a new warehouse," says the bored clerk.<br/><br/>Freddie runs into Mustafa Pasha, and drops in to his office to discuss Shakhti. Mustafa insists he is a great man, a friend of the King, with roots going all the way back to Muhammed Ali. They hit it off so well that Mustafa invites Freddie to dinner that night. He spends a pleasant evening getting drunk with some of the richer locals, all of who speak well of Shakhti--but Freddie gets the distinct impression that he is as powerful as he is rich--perhaps more so.<br/><br/>By the time he gets back to the hotel, Sheila has been waiting at the bar for hours. Freddie apologizes profusely and they stride out to the dance floor.<br/><br/>Pearkes checks in with MacDonald; he is still sick. The hotel's vet says that he is suffering from fatigue, not any physical ailment. Pearkes insists on taking MacDonald back up to his room in the two enormous suites Freddie has rented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412400/#Comment_412400" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T06:59:17+00:00" title="April 22, 2013  6:59AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally read through the thread.

I'll have to convert Shanghai myself, as it's not in that conversion, but by that point I should be comfortable enough doing so.

The conversion I'm using has helpfully outlined the Core clues. That said, the group has mostly found everything they can find. I'm a believer in giving them as much content as possible, and so far they've managed to get just about everything. (I think the only clue they didn't find in NYC was Robert Huston's files.)<br/><br/>It's kinda interesting on a bunch of levels when you think about it. <i>Masks</i> is much more fun when the PCs get to as much of the content as possible. OTOH, this is a mystery, right? Well...not sure. It's been remarked that <i>Masks</i> is probably the pulpiest of the major CoC adventures, and I'm definitely getting more mileage out of running it as a pulp campaign rather than an echt-horror campaign. So...if it's pulp, the main tension will come from <i>delaying</i> information rather than <i>denying</i> information; this is the infamous "You failed your Perception check" element that ToC specifically tries to overcome. Phillip Marlowe gets all the clues; he just doesn't always get them in time to save everybody.<br/><br/>I'm going to raise the question of the campaign genre with my players in the (overdue) after action report; personally, I'll be happy with "pulp, but victories require sacrifice" which when you think about it is the hallmark of higher grade pulp (and storytelling in general, but I figured everyone here knows that :-) )<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412439/#Comment_412439" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T19:48:27+00:00" title="April 22, 2013  7:48PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2013 7:50PM by Aviatrix.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: Night Comes On (Part )</b><br/><br/>"Have you ever been to Cairo before, Mr. Blakely?" says Sheila as they dance.<br/><br/>"No, at least not that I remember."<br/><br/>"You're a very good dancer. Is this how you met Miss Elias?"<br/><br/><i>[Sheila is over the moon about Freddie, not that she can do much about it.]</i><br/><br/>"Jax? No, actually. I met her in a, well, a salon. Bit of a rum old place, had a bad reputation..."<br/><br/><i>Dissolve to Freddie, in a Parisian bordello, sometime around 1917. Scantily-dressed women and men in uniforms fill the room.<br/><br/>Freddie is standing by the bar when he notices one of the women with a camera.<br/><br/>"I say, are you taking pictures?"<br/><br/>"Listen, Mac, why don't you lay off?"<br/><br/>"Nobody's ever taken me for a Scotsman before."<br/><br/>"Huh? Come on, mister. I'm a reporter. I'm here working on a story."<br/><br/>"Really? What about?"<br/><br/>"Well, it's...that is..."<br/><br/>She sighs. "Okay, the dish is that I'm trying to get up to the front. My editors just want me to report on what the nurses are wearing this year and that kind of thing. I figured if I got some pictures of some of the brass here I might be able to get a little, you know, leverage."<br/><br/>"Well, now. I might be able to help.

Maybe we can talk to him about Miss..."<br/><br/>"Olney. Elisa Olney. But everyone calls me Jax."<br/><br/>"Jax, I'm Freddie."<br/><br/>"Very pleased to meet you..."<br/><br/>[So this was a Stability-generating refresh scene--mixing a bit of Lady Blackbird in my ToC stew; plus I've been curious about knowing more about Freddie's relationship with Jax. I was kind of surprised last session when FP expressed surprise about Jax's ten-year delayed letter to him saying she knew he didn't love her, so I wanted to learn about his vision of the affair.]</i><br/><br/>In the middle of the night, MacDonald wakes up growling. When Pearkes goes to calm him, the dog is very agitated and bites him, then spends the rest of the night whimpering. It looks like the cause of MacDonald's fatigue is a bad case of night terrors.<br/><br/><i>Sunday 22 March 1925</i><br/><br/>Alphonse and Anton set out into the Old City to chase down their two main leads: Faraz Najir, and Warren Besart. On the way, they stop by a contact of Anton's to pick up some new (illegal) guns--Alphonse's favorite combination of sawed-off shotgun and heavy pistol.<br/><br/>After some hard searching they locate the Street of the Jackals, last known location of Faraz Najir. They discover the shop burnt out and long-abandoned. Alphonse casts a professional eye on the damage; the fire seems to have been very unusual, appearing to have started around waist-level and to not have burned much of the area around the shop.<br/><br/>Asking around with Anton's Arabic and Alphonse's charm results in some people telling them that a demon (spit) attacked the accursed Faraz Najir, but with the help of the Prophet (PBUH), he survived the fire and has moved out to one of the main bazaars in the city.<br/><br/>They find the tired old "Magasin des Antiquities" on a dusty side street. Stepping inside, they see nothing to be impressed with. Faraz hobbles out to the counter--and the brothers note with shock that one side of his face has been horribly burned.<br/><br/>"Yes, yes, I have many fine things. Ancient treasures. This is a papyrus from the Roman period. This, an artifact of Cleopatra..."<br/><br/>"How fascinating."<br/><br/>"Yes, thank you. You came just in time, soon I will head for the mosque, to thank Allah and the Prophet for sparing my life."<br/><br/>"Ah, of course. We're very interested. You were recommended to us...by Roger Carlyle."<br/><br/>Faraz's eyes go wide. "Carlyle? Out! Out of my shop! Get out! He begins shouting in Arabic. A listless crowd shows up. Deciding it to be the better part of valor, Alphonse and Anton retreat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412440/#Comment_412440" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T20:29:15+00:00" title="April 22, 2013  8:29PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: Night Comes On (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>Hanging back in the crowd, they wait until Najir closes up his shop and trail him to the mosque. After the services, he heads for a small teahouse nearby.<br/><br/>The brothers walk in and nonchalantly sit next to Faraz. "Hello, friend Najir."<br/><br/>"You!" He looks wildly around and starts to stand up.<br/><br/>"Please, why don't we talk about a few things," says Alphonse, flashing some cash.<br/><br/>"I...ah...oh, very well. I met this Carlyle. Useless American. He bought some very rare objects that...came into my collection."<br/><br/>"So you stole them?"<br/><br/>"They came into my collection...from the collection of Omar Shakhti. I may not have paid what they were worth...or anything at all..."<br/><br/>Najir goes into a technical description of how he was able to sneak into Shakhti's mansion and open the safe ("One of the tumblers on the left was loose...it was easy...") He chills the two of them with his description of Shakhti as the devil: "It is very dangerous, my friends, to cross Shakhti-Bey. He is a sorcerer, and a monster. Thanks only to the mercy of Allah was I saved..."<br/><br/><i>[Nuts, reviewing this I think I failed to give a couple of clues to the PCs. Not much harm done, and I'll reintroduce them later.]</i><br/><br/>Disturbed by this news, the two set out into the deepening night in search of Warren Besart. The police suggest that they check at the House of the Red Door at a nearby street. They stake it out and after a while they notice a stooped white man slipping into the house.<br/><br/>The brothers push open the door and follow. Abou, the owner of the laundry that occupies the building, tries to fob them off, but an intimidating glare and some Egyptian pounds convince him to duck out of the house while they go through a curtain in the back.<br/><br/>The human wreckage once known as Oren Besart, of Lausanne, Switzerland, looks blearily up at them. "Do you have any hashish?"<br/><br/>"Of course," says Alphonse smoothly, gesturing at his brother. Shrugging, Anton takes out some of the hashish he picked up that morning.<br/><br/>"Ah, messieurs, the things I have seen...you ask about the Carlyles? Yes. I was an agent here. I agreed to handle their affairs. I bought some illegally acquired artifacts from Faraz...Najir...you know him?<br/><br/>"The Carlyles, they dug...by the Sphinx, then at Dhashur, where the Bent Pyramid is...then down the river, near Luxor...they said they found something, a temple of some kind...<br/><br/>"Brady came to me...the American, the foreman...he told me he suspected something horrible was going on...and one day...they all went down into the dig...and did not come back.<br/><br/>"An old woman came to me. She said we were all lost, and if I wanted to see why, I should go to Meidum, the Collapsed Pyramid, at the last night of the moon...and I went...oh, God, I went...<br/><br/>"Do you have any more hashish?"<br/><br/>Alphonse gestures. Throwing up his hands and whispering "you're ruining me!", Anton tosses down the rest of his hashish.<br/><br/>"Merci, messieurs...I saw...in the night...obscene rituals. I thought I saw the members of the Carlyle expedition...and then the creatures...oh, they were horrible! Oh, they were all torn apart...<br/><br/>"I fled to the desert...I saw creatures there, such horrible things! Sphinxes! On all sides! And now I smoke, to keep the dreams away..."<br/><br/>As they leave, Besart stops Alphonse. "Nyiti of El Wasta. She and her son helped me. She knows.

Like I said, it was primarily motivated by my personal curiosity about the Jax-Freddie relationship. But I think I may have hit on something pretty good (acknowledging that I stole it from John Harper--<i>Lady Blackbird</i> is a graduate-level thesis on game design in under 20 pages), especially as the game begins to move away from pure horror, which I don't think my players are that interested in. Thrills &amp; challenges, yes; pure horror tropes, no.<br/><br/>It also helps me resolve the ongoing conflict I'm having, especially with FP, about the Sources of Stability. FP wanted Freddie to not be very close to folks (and yes, I suggested that they not have to be confidantes but he still wasn't all that excited), and the rest of the group ignored my directions for non-human Sources. ("Tangible, frangible, and unique.")<br/><br/>This leaves us with a complete mess at this point. Pearkes is the only one with a properly-worked out allotment of Sources; right now Freddie has only Sheila, Alphonse only Anton, and Charleston is completely messed up. (His Sources were Aleister Crowley and Mad Jack Churchill; I've since gently pointed out to CP that they are more properly Contacts, and he's likely to promote Bertha, owner of a Harlem diner Charleston frequents, as a source.)<br/><br/>So the refresh scenes accomplish a bunch of things for me. First, it will encourage this group of mostly trad rpg players to do a bit more narration &amp; character exploration; second, it lets them recover Stability without their Sources. If this were really a pure horror game I'd be more opposed to allowing that sort of thing, but we seem to be moving away from that and into what I hope will be high-grade pulp. I don't give more than one or two points for a refresh scene at the moment; we'll see how that goes in actual play. (One option is to increase it if you involve a PC or a Source; I'll ponder that and see how it plays out.)<br/><br/>Gilbert taking off with his brother was a pretty pleasant bit of business, well-done by GP. I liked getting him into the spotlight--in person, he's a bit reserved and still getting used to the greater emphasis on rping I have for this game. I didn't list all the buys, but he made a few--reassurance on Faraz for sure (and I think on the locals in the Street of Jackals) and maybe a Credit Rating buy on Warren Besart. (In the next installment we get an interesting scene where lack of an Investigative Ability point to use for a buy comes into play.) Most of the movement in that sequence was from GP; I used Anton sparingly but as a means of assistance for this sequence. Anton has an important role to play as Alphonse's pain in the neck, but I brought him along to mostly complement the PCs. (He's the only other member of the group who speaks Arabic, for example.)<br/><br/>The group wanted to go to Shakhti's the day before, when they still hadn't found out anything about him or chased down their other leads. I pointed out that maybe they should try to research Shakhti. (Going in blind to the meeting with Shakhti would probably be very deadly.) <br/><br/>That should bring us up to date; the next installments will detail the first intimations of betrayal and conspiracy, and demonstrate why you should probably never accept a sorcerer's invitation to dinner....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412489/#Comment_412489" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T19:03:36+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  7:03PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm working on a revision of "Watchtower" that should be done soon.

Sure, you can be a loner -- but you won't refresh Stability that way.<br/><br/>I would argue that this is a plausible way of playing IF the player is consciously doing it and willing to accept the consequences. But, I don't think that's what's going on here, given FP wants more pulp and less horror. The price for that is connectedness. Even class clowns and Bertie Wooster types have that.\n<blockquote>This leaves us with a complete mess at this point.

I could totally see Crowley as a Source of Stability under some circumstances, but given this is the first indication of there being any connection between Crowley and Charleston, I think coming up with better sources is a good idea.\n<blockquote>The group wanted to go to Shakhti's the day before, when they still hadn't found out anything about him or chased down their other leads. I pointed out that maybe they should try to research Shakhti. (Going in blind to the meeting with Shakhti would probably be very deadly.) </blockquote>\nShakhti is tricky to handle correctly. In either CoC or ToC, the Keeper theoretically has no further responsibility beyond "here's the clue that Shakhti is important in some capacity".  But, we all know that going straight to Shakhti is a horrendous idea, possibly even a campaign killer. What to do?<br/><br/>I think "perhaps you should try to research Shakhti" potentially gives too much away, unless you are consistently saying it about every lead every time. If I were on the ball, I might do this via misdirection, e.g., "Well, this Shakhti person is apparently important enough you can't just drop by. You probably want to find an angle so that he'll agree to see you." This is, in some ways, "Go, do research on him first", but without saying so. OTOH, that's a magician's force, and perhaps as railroady as the first. On the third tentacle, not all railroading is bad.<br/><br/>When I ran the campaign (rather badly), one PC approached Shakhti and told him everything. Another found out from Faraz Najir what the deal with Shakhti was. The PCs had the means to get out of Egypt quickly and untraceably, and did so. I'm not quite sure what I would have done if this hadn't happened. Among my other mistakes, I forgot that the dig in Egypt had a couple of folks who could cast spells at the PCs.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412497/#Comment_412497" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T20:15:43+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  8:15PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa,<br/><br/>I'll best be able to address some of this after the next write-up.

(We took out Ho Fong with a drive-by in Shanghai; but then CoC was always incoherent about "don't get in combat with the Mythos, but shotguns are hella useful.")<br/><br/>As for the hint about Shakhti, a TPK doesn't do anyone good at this point, so I gently guided them away from it.

I thought I would be a psychologist, but it turns out Anthropology interested me more....") translates the medical Arabic.<br/><br/>The report seems ordinary--Dr. Kafour died of a heart attack; this syncs up with the English version of the report.<br/><br/>Freddie notices, however, that Dr. Mwimbe isn't reading the rest of the Arabic report. When he points that out, she dismisses it as superstition. "It says that when they did the autopsy, they did not find a heart. Ridiculous Egyptian nonsense; you can't trust these people."<br/><br/>As they leave the morgue, Freddie asks Dr. Mwimbe to help him find a gift to bring Shakhti Bey. Flattered, she takes them to the antiquities market where they buy a cuneiform tablet with a fragment of the Epic of Gilgamesh on it.<br/><br/>However, as Freddie had planned, this gives Alphonse a chance to check up on Dr. Mwimbe. He sneaks into her room. While the Dagger of Thoth is kept in the hotel safe, she has the artifacts they retrieved from the Ju-Ju House in Harlem in her room. The strange devil mask, the circlet, and the bowl of "copper." The scepter seems to be missing.<br/><br/>Examining the bowl carefully, Alphonse finds a little dried blood on the inside. He can't tell if it's recent or if it had been there since they got it.<br/><br/><i>[Forensics buy; Alphonse is the "cleaner" after all.]</i><br/><br/>Suddenly he hears footsteps approaching. Slipping into a closet, he watches as an Egyptian man enters the room and leaves some books on the bed. The man looks around for a moment, as if he had noticed something, and then slips out. He's wearing something around his neck, but Alphonse can't tell what it is.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble &amp; Stealth rolls by GP; I decided noticing the necklace would cost a 1-point Evidence Collection buy, and GP had already used his earlier in the session, so he didn't get the clue at this point.]</i><br/><br/>After the man leaves, Gilbert slips out of the room and tails him. It takes some time, but he finally sees the man enter a tea shop. Casing the place for a while, Gilbert sees several other men come in and talk with his target. Some of them wear an inverted ankh around their neck.<br/><br/><i>[....and then I gave it to him anyway. This is kind of a weird case here. Getting the clue required GP to commit some actual play time to finding it out. However, I should have raised the stakes here and had there be some actual danger from this task.

The group drive out of Cairo, crossing the Nile and heading into the setting sun. Soon they reach the plantations of Omar Shakhti. The vast fields are golden in the sunlight. As they drive along, the evening prayers begin, and rows of men bowing in unison are silhouetted against the red sun.<br/><br/><i>[I literally introduced this part by saying "Here's the part with the great cinematography..."]</i><br/><br/>As they approach the house they come to a long, low wall. As they arrive at the gate, a group of horsemen gallop towards them. They rein in at the gate, blocking the road.<br/><br/>They are obviously Bedouin.<br/><br/>"English, stop!"<br/><br/>"We have an appointment with Shakhti Bey," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"They are at prayer now."<br/><br/>"Really? We saw everyone praying as we drove up. They should be done by now, yes?"<br/><br/>"They pray at different times in the house."<br/><br/><i>[This was an off-handed line by me, since FP had kind of forced some timing on me. However, in retrospect it works out--"They pray at different times" is really a bit chilling when you realize this is a Lovecraft game.]</i><br/><br/>Soon after the horsemen open the gate. As they drive in, the leader of the Bedouin trots his horse next to the car. "Are you truly here to see the Sheikh?"<br/><br/>"Yes, we're to dine with him," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Ah! The Sheikh is a great man. He lets us hunt on his lands in return for our service. And when men of his try to run, he lets us hunt them too! A very great man!"<br/><br/>"I see! Yes, sounds very great."<br/><br/>"What are you called, English?"<br/><br/>"Freddie."<br/><br/>"Ah, Freddie of the English, it is good to meet you. I am Wazim." He reins in his horse. "Good-bye, Freddie of the English. May we meet again."<br/><br/>Shakhti's house turns out to be a very large villa in the Turkish style, but with numerous Egyptian touches, such as gold-leaf covered lotus columns and graven hieroglyphs. They leave the car and are led by the major-domo to a sitting room. "Shakhti Bey will be with you momentarily."<br/><br/>Some time passes. Eventually a door opens and two men step out--a middle-aged man in an elegantly cut European suit, and an older man wearing a fez and loose Turkish clothing.<br/><br/>Freddie stands up. "Shakhti Bey, a pleasure."<br/><br/>"Ah, you must be Mr. Blakely! The pleasure is all mine. And may I introduce His Majesty."<br/><br/>King Fuad nods gravely. "Good evening, Mr. Blakely. I am always happy to meet an English gentleman, and an English officer, Colonel Pearkes. Sadly, I cannot remain for dinner as matters of state call me away. I hope to meet you both again."<br/><br/>After the King leaves, Shakhti claps them on their shoulders. "Come, let me show you my home. Mr. Blakely, Colonel. And who is this delightful woman?"<br/><br/>"Dr. Mwimbe," she says smoothly, offering her hand.<br/><br/>"Dr....Mwimbe! Yes, I believe I've heard of your work. An honor to have an expert like yourself here. Come. Let me show my house, and then we will have dinner. Tonight there will be no question of rank or sex; you are all welcome at my table."<br/><br/>Shakhti leads them on a dizzying tour of his house. Each room is decorated with artifacts of a different period of Middle Eastern history, starting with Mesopotamia and then quickly concentrating on the dynasties of Egypt, Roman and Greek periods, the French invasion, the age of the Mamelukes, Muhammad Ali's Egypt, etc. Shakhti displays a deep knowledge of every period of history. "This, this here is Julius Caesar's sword, that he drew when he came to Alexandria."<br/><br/>Freddie notices a bust of Cleopatra in the corner. The face is disturbingly familiar, but he can't place it.<br/><br/><i>[FP was all out of Art History.]</i><br/><br/>They come to the end of the tour and meet in the sitting room. "While I am a faithful Muslim, I appreciate that my guests may not share my devotion. We have a full complement of wines and liquors for your pleasure."<br/><br/>Over drinks and dinner, they engage in a long, rambling conversation with the urbane and unfailingly polite Shakhti. Mostly they talk of politics and history. Shakhti is an unabashed Egyptian and Muslim patriot; he often makes references to the great accomplishments of various Muslims, of Babylon under the Caliphs, of Egypt under Muhammad Ali. Although he adopts Turkish stylings, he has little respect for the period of Ottoman rule. <br/><br/>However, it is clear that no matter who ruled Egypt, Shakhti and his family have always gotten along well with the rulers, whether they were Turks, Mamelukes, or the British. He is a royalist, and dismissive of the Wafd and popular rule in general.<br/><br/><i>[We mostly RP'ed this conversation, which was too intricate for me to do it justice; the above summary is a pale reflection. Shakhti betrayed no occult connections, but made it clear that while always displaying complete rectitude, he thinks very little of the Europeans and delights in being the power center.]</i><br/><br/>Before dinner, Freddie gives Shakhti his gift. He is surprised and delighted.<br/><br/>"Dr. Mwimbe helped me pick it out, you know."<br/><br/>"Did she?" Shakhti's eyes flash at the professor. "Very appropriate gift, Doctor. I am honored."<br/><br/>They adjourn to the drawing room after dinner. Freddie tosses his coat to Gilbert, and his valet silently leaves the room. Shakhti, who despite saying rank would not be an issue that night had mostly ignored Alphonse, seems not to notice.<br/><br/>Gilbert slips through the house, avoiding servants. He notices that there must be many secret passages in the villa allowing servants unobserved access to the rooms.<br/><br/>He finds Shakhti's study, and the large safe in the corner. Using Najir's tale as a guide, he is easily able to open the safe.<br/><br/><i>[Core clue, and Alphonse has Locksmith.]</i><br/><br/>Inside, he finds some money and some rather ordinary ledger books. One ledger, however, details illegal shipments of antiquities to countries outside of Egypt, mostly to a Ho Fong Imports of Shanghai. There is also a letter from "A.P"--Sir Aubrey? The letter does not seem very old.<br/><br/>He copies the ledger entries down as best he can and then slips back into the drawing room.<br/><br/>After their brandy, Freddie and company make their farewells. "We really must get back to Cairo."<br/><br/>"Ah, of course. Please, let me see you out."<br/><br/>As they approach their car, they notice a figure slumped beside it--their driver, dead drunk.<br/><br/>"How unfortunate!" cries Shakhti. "You can't trust these fellahin. How terrible."<br/><br/>"No problem, Shakhti Bey," says Freddie. "The Colonel here can drive us in to town."<br/><br/>"Please, you are free to stay with me if you desire."<br/><br/>"No, can't put you to any trouble."<br/><br/>Pearkes gets behind the wheel. The car resolutely refuses to start. He opens the hood.<br/><br/>The distributor is missing.<br/><br/>"Those Bedouin thieves! I will have them whipped immediately. Unfortunately, my own driver is in town tonight, getting spare parts. I am afraid that you will have to stay after all."<br/><br/>And the night comes on. It is very calm, as they enter the house. The storm has yet to break.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412504/#Comment_412504" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T21:26:11+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  9:26PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And we're current!

This was my hard move--going to Shakhti meant that they were not going to get to leave under their own terms. If they had come earlier in the day, they would have had a chance to extricate themselves (and I explicitly planned for that; an earlier trip would not have resulted in as hard a move), but coming that late makes it too easy for Shakhti.<br/><br/>BTW, 23 March 1925 wasn't just the parliamentary elections; it was also the last night before the new moon. Those of you who know Masks understand what that means.<br/><br/>Yeah, a tight spot. However, not a guaranteed TPK, not yet. The PCs have an ally of sorts that they don't know about, and just killing them isn't in the cards. (Why would Shakhti let them come if he <i>only</i> wanted to kill them? He has much more interesting things to try.)<br/><br/>The game getting more pulpy, of course they'll get some outs. Still, there's going to be almost literally the devil to pay in getting out of this mess; we'll surely have more than one combat next session, and they will need to have their wits around them to escape.<br/><br/>Writing this up, I'm wondering a bit about how this worked out. Was it just a magician's force? Not sure. Some circumstances (can't put them in the open thread; whisper me for details) meant that Shakhti was very aware of their entry to Egypt. But they could have avoided him; while I wanted the dramatic possibilities of a confrontation with Shakhti, I was willing to let them find their own path.<br/><br/>And there's still much to see! The Clive Expedition! Trying to get the content Kafour didn't get a chance to give them (another hard move.) And the meeting with you know who! All to come...soon. We don't have the next game date set...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412518/#Comment_412518" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T05:03:21+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  5:03AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sigh. Checking this I notice two huge points got left out. I've edited the relevant posts: part 4 and part 8.<br/><br/><b>Part 4</b><br/><br/>"Dr. Kafour, do you know a place around here called Victory?" asks Freddie, remembering Polidori's rambling statement.<br/><br/>"Victory? You are in it! This is Al-Qahira--it means, 'The Victorious'."<br/><br/>The group exchanges glances--so "The Master" is in Cairo.<br/><br/><i>[Important, in that they were primed to expect Shakhti to be The Master that Polidori spoke about. Of course, they walked into his lair anyway...]</i><br/><br/><b>Part 8</b><br/><br/>They adjourn to the drawing room after dinner. Freddie tosses his coat to Gilbert, and his valet silently leaves the room. Shakhti, who despite saying rank would not be an issue that night had mostly ignored Alphonse, seems not to notice.<br/><br/>Gilbert slips through the house, avoiding servants. He notices that there must be many secret passages in the villa allowing servants unobserved access to the rooms.<br/><br/>He finds Shakhti's study, and the large safe in the corner. Using Najir's tale as a guide, he is easily able to open the safe.<br/><br/><i>[Core clue, and Alphonse has Locksmith.]</i><br/><br/>Inside, he finds some money and some rather ordinary ledger books. One ledger, however, details illegal shipments of antiquities to countries outside of Egypt, mostly to a Ho Fong Imports of Shanghai. There is also a letter from "A.P"--Sir Aubrey? The letter does not seem very old.<br/><br/>He copies the ledger entries down as best he can and then slips back into the drawing room.<br/><br/><i>[GPs plan, and the one justification for visiting Shakhti.

In either CoC or ToC, the Keeper theoretically has no further responsibility beyond "here's the clue that Shakhti is important in some capacity".  But, we all know that going straight to Shakhti is a horrendous idea, possibly even a campaign killer. What to do?<br/>.....<br/>When I ran the campaign (rather badly), one PC approached Shakhti and told him everything. Another found out from Faraz Najir what the deal with Shakhti was. The PCs had the means to get out of Egypt quickly and untraceably, and did so. I'm not quite sure what I would have done if this hadn't happened. Among my other mistakes, I forgot that the dig in Egypt had a couple of folks who could cast spells at the PCs.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nOf all the villains in <i>Masks</i>, Shakhti is the worst detailed. And yet he's easily the most powerful. <i>H\xe9las</i>.<br/><br/>Shakhti shows in glorious detail one of the biggest flaws I find in the Chaosium material (overall, not just <i>Masks</i> which is actually much better than most of it): character motivation is non-existent or nonsensical.<br/><br/>I mean, sure, you can have "Shakhti is just EEEEVvvill." Okay...I guess. But what's the use of that, on any more thoughtful level.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that he's really tangential to the plot, without any connection to the Carlyle Expedition. At least Gavigan is tied to the Penhew Foundation (and IIRC, was noted as being ambitious in the cult and a bit of a protege to Sir Aubrey.) But Shakhti just floats out there without anything really tying him down except his potential role in the raising of Nilocritis.<br/><br/>So. My Shakhti. What was to be done?<br/><br/>First I considered just what kind of an immortal he might be. I flashed to my inner Rein-Dot-Hagen and decided to look at vampire. (He's not <i>exactly</i> one, but his "children" definitely are.) Then I settled on just who he was and where he came from. (That will come in further installments.)<br/><br/>Also, as part of my campaign prep, I drew out a sketch relationship map between the main villains; since I'm adding an ultimate, behind the scenes Big Bad, I included that person as well. I tried to think how all these people would interact. Surely they wouldn't get along perfectly, right? It would also let me develop some motivation for each of them.<br/><br/>Don't want to give away too much, but for Shakhti I focused on the relationship between the two African members of the conspiracy: M'Weru and Shakhti. I had already decided that my M'Weru was not going to be some simple girl from the bush who got a massive infodump, but someone accomplished in her own respect, someone who pursues the conspiracy to further her own ends.<br/><br/>And just happens to be the favorite of the Dark God.<br/><br/>So that was the basis of their relationship: Shakhti is jealous of the respect that his Lord pays to this simple <i>human</i>, who has lived a fraction of a his life on Earth; M'Weru hates the old man for his power and independence--alone of all the conspirators, she can't cow Shakhti without calling on her relationship with the Big N; which is personally galling to her.<br/><br/>Now, as for the actual events: I wasn't really giving away too much by suggesting that the PCs research Shakhti a bit more. They already suspected he was Polidori's "Master" and thus a vampire (there were numerous out of character jokes during the tour of his villa about how Shakhti probably had been witness to most of the history.)<br/><br/>And furthermore, <i>Shakhti knew they were coming</i>--not just because they invited themselves over, but because he had been warned about them as soon as they entered Egypt. But what to do? Sure, simple assassination might work, but there are conspiratorial complications with that; he might be acting against the will of the Dark One, for one thing. Also, Freddie with his usual mix of bad luck and cunning, is now well-known to some powerful Egyptians. Shakhti could surely pave that over, but it would involve an expenditure of his resources.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean he won't try to kill them; he's certainly ready to do so. <i>But it's best to try it on his own turf</i>, especially as it gives him a chance to find out what they know, and maybe tease out just what his latitude is with them.<br/><br/>Anyway, that was my thinking. No, wait. That's my rationale. Truthfully I was all about the bangs; I want the dramatic confrontation with Shakhti, and some nervy and tense flight/fight scenes. Pulp fiction, baby.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412551/#Comment_412551" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T11:05:34+00:00" title="April 24, 2013 11:05AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(We took out Ho Fong with a drive-by in Shanghai; but then CoC was always incoherent about "don't get in combat with the Mythos, but shotguns are hella useful.")</blockquote>\nNot a huge contradiction.

This is a guy with good reason to be loyal to the Outer Gods. Whenever he dies, he will be raised or reincarnated by them. He's that valuable. He gets immortality directly out of serving the Outer Gods.<br/><br/>He also gets power, and has no particular reason to be ethical.<br/><br/>Mind, the game I ran Masks in wasn't Call of Cthulhu, but a homebrew with NightLife, various WoD bits, and theoretically a smattering a cyberpunk. So, eventually, at great cost, the entire world was warded against the Outer Gods.<br/><br/>So, in the year 2020, a reincarnated Shakhti is of age -- low 20s. He's a sorcerer, and that means he's unlikely to worry about aging. But, he is cut off from his masters. If he dies, they can't bring him back with the full knowledge of all his past lives that he's used to. This changes things completely for him.<br/><br/>I didn't do a lot with him at that point, just had him make cameos. Sure, he'd done bad things in past lives. So? He's not really touchable for that in a legal way. He was born in the late 1990s, and has not committed any major crimes, and possibly no minor ones.

Humans with access to that magic/technology can make all kinds of interesting villains. ("Wait...you mean when my grandma had that stroke...that was <i>you</i>?")<br/><br/>I've been thinking some more about the Sources stuff; it seems to be the major pinch-point in the campaign so far. I reiterated my rulings last night in my after-action report (Humans only, you can designate new sources if you have open slots either by saying they're in the place you're headed to or by promoting NPCs you've interacted with), but I also want to step back a bit.<br/><br/>Right now I think the thing to do is to just sit back and let the rules take care of themselves. I'll throw a few threats at the Sources from time to time, and let the mechanical consequences take care of themselves. I think you were right up above, Lisa; not taking Sources is a bit like saying you don't want to roll Saving Throws in d20; fine, but you'll auto-fail, not auto-succeed when you do that.<br/><br/>OTOH, not everybody wants a coterie of hangers-on; I don't want to beat up people for that or shove them into a character concept they don't want. (That's why I initially allowed non-human sources; it's just that nobody followed my instructions. Except PP, which is why he keeps MacDonald. My initial example was a build of my old CoC character, who had "solo flying in her Curtiss Jenny" as a Source--but the point was that it had to be <i>that specific plane</i>, and thus was as endangered as any Source.)<br/><br/>So: I don't want to enforce a specific concept on PCs. And mechanically I'm obligated to do so. Rock, hard place. <br/><br/>I'm sure this will somehow shake out eventually in play, just not sure how yet.<br/><br/>The refresh scene experiment will bear watching. I was thinking about this last night and I realized that it's really not that big a deal to refresh a couple of points per session. Our sessions are generally twice as long as the standard 3-4 hour session, so being able to get some Stability back makes up for not having the intersession refresh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413275/#Comment_413275" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T10:03:49+00:00" title="May  1, 2013 10:03AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like the next session will be 11 May, so I'll have something to post in a fortnight or so.<br/><br/>I'm thinking, as part of the slight pivot towards pulpier play, of introducing something along the lines of <i>Night's Black Agents</i>' Tactical Fact Finding Benefit (using investigative skills to give a bonus to general skills during combat, primarily.)

Of course, it's Lovecraft; not only the twisty syntax, but the deliberate anachronisms (seriously, who besides somebody working at a white-shoe law firm used <i>q.v.</i> as a common abbreviation in the 1980s?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413626/#Comment_413626" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T10:39:32+00:00" title="May  6, 2013 10:39AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I was the FLGS on Saturday and finally broke down and bought the hardcover <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> (I'd been relying on the pdf til now) and <i>Night's Black Agents</i> as well. NBA is bloody awesome, and I want it to be my next game. (Plus it could handle a Masks sequel, I think.)<br/><br/>I've decided to port a bunch of stuff from NBA into the campaign. The NBA version of Sources of Stability seems a better fit for this group, so I'm going to use that, and I'll add in most of the combat options (martial arts, special weapons training, usw.) This group likes their combat a bit crunchier, and vs. Mythos baddies it won't matter all that much in any case.<br/><br/>NBA also has an excellent Chase resolution system, and I'm shamelessly porting that as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413989/#Comment_413989" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T07:15:16+00:00" title="May 13, 2013  7:15AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Session IV was on Saturday, and pretty cracking.

A symbol gives a 1 point refresh in-session.<br/><br/><b>Freddie</b>: Memories of his affair with Jackson Elias (the only abstract symbol)<br/><b>Pearkes</b>: His Victoria Cross<br/><b>Charleston</b>: His Tommy gun<br/><br/>Still figuring out what Alphonse's Symbol would be.<br/><br/><b>Solace</b>: the person who keeps you going. Six hours of non-threatened time together with your Solace refreshes 2 points of Stability in-session; in between sessions, a Solace can refresh Stability completely.<br/><br/><b>Freddie</b>: Sheila Brisbane, loyal and long-suffering secretary<br/><b>Pearkes</b>: MacDonald, loyal Elkhound<br/><b>Charleston</b>: Noor (new NPC introduced in-session, she is his partner in the dark arts)<br/><b>Alphonse</b>: Anton Gilbert, brother and professional thief<br/><br/><b>Safety</b>: This is a place of refuge, with significant resources available to the PCs. Can provide a full stability refresh. This is really more appropriate for the Thriller genre, so for simplicity's sake I made the offices of the <i>Golden Sentinel</i> in New York City the Safety for the entire group. Later we may differentiate Safeties.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this worked pretty well; it simplified things, allowed the PCs to take a quick refresh of Stability as they went along (I am happily able to report that I got two PCs negative this time), and seems less likely to be abused. Of course, FP immediately wanted to have a mobile Safety ("Wherever the Aunts chew me out"), but I dodged that for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414176/#Comment_414176" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T11:48:10+00:00" title="May 16, 2013 11:48AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2013 11:49AM by Aviatrix.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Champagne and Battle Cries, Just in Time For Sunrise (Part 1)</b><br/><br/><i>24 March 1925</i><br/><br/><i>[Having cleverly maneuvered the PCs into a tight spot, we pick up with the PCs making their way back into the villa of Omar Shakhti...<br/><br/>I say </i>maneuvered<i>, but really: the point of having a vast conspiracy is to be more powerful than a rag-tag group of heroes. Shakhti saw an opportunity and took it, is all. This would be a theme of the session.]</i><br/><br/>Shakhti invites Freddie to take a walk around the Masjid, the large central courtyard the villa uses as a mosque, with him. People are filling up the space gradually; Shakhti explains that they will have a special service that evening. He offers Freddie a glass of iced champagne, and drinks one himself.<br/><br/><i>[Subtle hint that Shakhti was about to let the mask slip a bit--he'd been keeping the devout Muslim facade up before this.]</i><br/><br/>"You interest me, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>"I seem to do that to a great many people."<br/><br/>"It's very strange, don't you think? No matter what happens, you seem to be at the center."<br/><br/>"I believe that the only reason people think these things is that I'm so dashed good looking. I mean, you'd think that the person at the center of the plot would know what is going on!"<br/><br/>"And yet, when Jackson Elias fled Cairo for New York, where did she go? Why, to you, Mr. Blakely. And when Dr. Blont and Mr. Chiu broke up the white slavery ring, who appeared at the press conference? Who employed them? You, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>"Well, Jax <i>knew</i> me is all."<br/><br/>"So what <i>does</i> bring you to Cairo?"<br/><br/>"Oh, seeing the sights, helping out Dr. Mwimbe."<br/><br/>"Ah yes. <i>Mwimbe</i>."<br/><br/>"And, well, I know you try to stay out of politics, but I seem to have helped out on an election. Was Perksies' fault, really. Seems Porgie got himself in a spot with the locals, so I made a bit of a contribution to the Wafd."<br/><br/>"Ah, the rabble."<br/><br/>"Indeed. So, if you don't mind, I'll just have another drink and then be off to my room."<br/><br/>"Please sir, take the bottle. I allow myself certain indulgences, as any gentleman might."<br/><br/>Meanwhile Pearkes is led up to his guest room. This is a not-large but well-appointed chamber, with a sliding wooden door that leads out to an open corridor on the Masjid. An elaborate wrought-iron railing marks the edge of the walkway.<br/><br/>As the servant prepares the room, Pearkes notices to his surprise that on his wrist is tattooed a small "Red Ensign" (the national flag of Canada during this time) and the date "31-10-17"--the same dates that Pearkes earned his Victoria's Cross during Passchendaele.<br/><br/>"You! What's the meaning of that tattoo!"<br/><br/>"La, la, la," mutters the man. Although covered up, Pearkes can tell he's European.<br/><br/><i>[At this point, we discussed interpersonal skills. PP was thinking about bureaucracy--"What are you going to have him do, fill out a form?" I asked--under the theory that it would "put him in a military mindset", but we settled on Reassurance. I wanted to see if he would use Intimidate--I asked him what he would have done to a shell-shocked soldier at Passchendaele.]</i><br/><br/>Approaching the man with open arms, Pearkes gruffly barks: "You, sir! What unit were you?"<br/><br/>"No...no unit..."<br/><br/>"Come on, man! Speak out!"<br/><br/>"Major....Major Pearkes? Don't you remember me? Don't you remember Passchendaele?"<br/><br/>"I remember Passchendaele."<br/><br/>"It's me, sir, Billy, sir! I was in the unit next to your'n. We was pinned down, sir. You weren't even our CO, but you took command! We'd have all died, if it weren't for you!"<br/><br/><i>[This is based on an incident from the actual Pearkes' VC citation.]</i><br/><br/>"What are you doing working for Shakhti, Billy?"<br/><br/>"It's the cult, sir. They took Billy, they did sir. He came to Cairo after the war, to make his fortune like he did in Afghanisatan..."<br/><br/>Billy, who seems to be of rather questionable Sanity (and Stability), nonetheless convinces Pearkes that he can help him escape from the Villa, and that they should do so soon, because "Tonight's special, sir. Tonight's <i>Ceremony</i>." He also says he knows where Shakhti's gun room is; he only asks that Pearkes save Billy again.<br/><br/>Freddie makes his way up to his room, which is similar to Pearkes' room, although in a different part of the villa.<br/><br/><i>[Yeah. Shakhti wasn't keeping the PCs together.]</i><br/><br/>He stares out at the Masjid, listening to a rather evil-looking blind cleric lead the service. Although the sermon seems rather standard, Freddie senses a mood of anticipation in the crowd--as if the service wasn't the thing they were waiting for.<br/><br/><i>[Assess Honesty by FP]</i><br/><br/>Freddie ponders the building. His knowledge of Roman architecture leads him to believe that there are secret passages to allow servants access to the villa without being seen, but he's unsure about exactly how to find entrance into these passages.<br/><br/><i>[FP attempted to use Art History, but was out of spends. I'd have given it to him with a spend. I did let him see the schematic I made of the villa; I was going to do a map on Fractal Mapper, and even started, but I couldn't get it right; besides, I didn't want this to be a dungeon crawl.]</i><br/><br/>Pondering his situation, Freddie leaves a glass of champagne on the windowsill, messes up his bed, and then moves two doors down the hallway. Jostling the door hard eventually opens it up.<br/><br/><i>[Freddie doesn't have locksmith, but these weren't really good locks, so Athletics did the trick.]</i><br/><br/>Searching the room, Freddie finds a yellow robe in the closet that does not seem related to any branch of Muslim observance that he recognizes. He begins to put it on.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll by Freddie; FP asked for Preparedness, looking for something like a rope, but I gave him the robe--much more useful, in the long run.]</i><br/><br/>A knock comes on Pearkes' room. Billy ducks out as Shakhti's major-domo invites Pearkes to meet the Bey in his private residence. Two burly servants indicate that this invitation is substantially less than a request.<br/><br/>They traverse many of the halls that Shakhti showed them on their initial tour of the villa, and then one he most emphatically did <i>not</i>. This is a room dedicated to a Pharaoh unknown to Pearkes' knowledge of Egyptian history, lit by flickering torches, and dominated by the bust of a Pharaoh cut out of a strange black stone. Something peculiar about the way the light doesn't reflect off of the stone bothers Pearkes. Five large sarcophagi stand against the walls of the hall.<br/><br/>Shakhti's office in his residence proves to be an astonishingly lavishly appointed room. The furniture is Second Empire and Louis XIV; heavy cut glass mirrors dominate the space. Pearkes notes a certificate from the coronation of Edward VII hanging on the wall.<br/><br/><i>[Nifty detail provided by PP; his grandfather had been to Elizabeth II's coronation and had a similar certificate, which PP showed us.]</i><br/><br/>The room seems to take up an entire floor of the residence, with balconies at either end. Shakhti stands with his hands clapsed behind him on the balcony overlooking the courtyard, which is filling up with people; in the dim light (it is the last day before the new moon), Pearkes can't see much detail.<br/><br/>"Ah, Colonel Pearkes.

I thought I knew all the Pharaohs, but I didn't recognize the one in the hall."<br/><br/>"You speak of the Black Pharaoh, Nephren-Ka. I think you'd like him; he ruled with an iron will. This was long ago, when Egypt was a great empire."<br/><br/>"Empires are in the habit of falling."<br/><br/>"Yes they are, Colonel Pearkes! Yes they are! Especially empires composed of shopkeepers and shipping clerks."<br/><br/><i>[FP: Ah, you speak of the Dutch.]</i><br/><br/>"So tell me, Colonel. Why are you in my home? Why are you in Egypt?"<br/><br/>"I was asked to come by a gentleman, and when one is asked to do something by one's betters, one goes."<br/><br/>"But I find you to be a most independently-minded officer, as befits a cavalryman. We were a great cavalry power once, you know. I'm sure you've heard of the Mamelukes? Came a cropper against Napoleon. They did not adapt with the times, sir. Adapting with the times is key, don't you think?"<br/><br/>The courtyard is being filled with people bearing torches. They are wearing yellow robes. In the flickering light, Pearkes can make out an ancient obelisk in the center of the vast paved expanse. Something about it troubles him; he is fairly well versed on ancient religions, but cannot think of one that would require iron rings to be driven into the sides of an obelisk.<br/><br/>"That's an interesting obelisk, Shakhti."<br/><br/>"Yes, it's quite old. It dates from thousands of years ago. We Egyptians were civilized while the Britons were still chasing sheep, for what purpose one can only surmise. Do you know what I dislike about the British? I include you even though I know you are Canadian now. It is an empire of petty merchants and shopkeepers. I have been to your Empire, sir. I have been to East Africa. Ten thousand [racial slurs] being commanded by a clerk from Winslow...."<br/><br/>Shakhti motions to Pearkes. "Come sir. Let me show you what an Empire really is. What power really is."<br/><br/>Pearkes steps onto the balcony. Below, a row of people wearing yellow robes are kneeling down.<br/><br/>"Those are our catechumens. They have spent years preparing themselves for entry into our Brotherhood, passing many trials and showing the utmost dedication. Behind them stand their parents, who sponsored them, and who have striven for years to ensure their safe entry into the Brotherhood."<br/><br/>Shakhti nods at the crowd.<br/><br/>Without a word, the people standing behind the kneeling cultists begin to swing spiked clubs. The kneeling catechumens do not resist, but instead give orgiastic shrieks of joy.<br/><br/>"That is real power, Colonel! That is Empire!" Shakhti draws himself up menancingly. "In Uruk...five thousand years ago...I ruled as king and was worshipped as a god! I stood on Sargon's right hand as we forged the world's first empire, our bronze swords shining red in the rising sun!"<br/><br/>Shakhti's eyes begin to glow red. Pearkes quails for a moment, feeling his will being beaten upon by unseen forces.<br/><br/>Then he stabs the Bey in the head with the sword concealed in his swagger stick.<br/><br/>Shakhti stares for a moment, then steps back. The sword slides out of his face with a sickening sucking noise. <br/><br/>"There's only one way, sir," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"Is there?" says Shakhti.<br/><br/>His eyes glow an even more intense red.<br/><br/>Pearkes swoons for a second. And then his will is no longer his own. His body has become Shakhti's puppet.<br/><br/><i>[Domination spell by Shakhti. To Pearkes' credit, he was genuinely surprised to be stabbed; it just doesn't faze him.]</i><br/><br/>"Oh Colonel, whatever shall we do with you? Whatever shall we do? Ah. I know. I shall send you to the wives. They will enjoy you."<br/><br/>"If they're anything like you, [racial slur], I won't enjoy them."<br/><br/>Shakhti mutters instructions to Pearkes, including a password--"hetep"--that he is to use if anyone tries to stop him. Compelled to move, Pearkes begins to head towards the wives' quarters.<br/><br/><br/>Back in the vacant bedroom, Freddie is trying on one of the robes. He hears a scratching at the door, which he ignores, as he is not supposed to be in that room.<br/><br/>The door slides back, and a small white cat steps in. It regards Freddie quizzically.<br/><br/>"Mee-reow?" Freddie recognizes the cat as the one Shakhti played with in the sitting room. The cat sits very prettily in the center of the room.<br/><br/>Then its tongue flies out and wraps around Freddie's neck.<br/><br/>The tongue begins to reel Freddie in. He fights back for a second, then lunges forward, grabbing the cat and wrapping the tongue around one of the posts of the bed.<br/><br/>The cat begins to grow larger, and vaguely humanoid. <br/><br/>Still choking, Freddie grabs at the cat, which slashes at him viciously with its claws.<br/><br/>As the cat continues to gouge him, Freddie leaps through the window, vaults the railing, and plunges towards the Masjid, where the cleric is giving a reading on charity.<br/><br/>At the last second, he catches the railing with his foot. The now six-foot tall cat-demon sails away from him, flailing weakly at him.<br/><br/><i>[Interesting strategy by Freddie, although as PP pointed out, he risked giving himself the long drop and breaking his neck. Still, Athletics covers a host of sins; I made his success more dramatic with catching his left foot; meanwhile FP narrated a great scene for a 3-point pool refresh (another Night's Black Agents rule I lifted.)</i><br/><br/>Surprisingly, the crowd gathered below do not seem to be too disturbed by the sight of a man in elegant evening clothes and a yellow robe hanging from the tongue of a cat demon. Freddie manages to pull off the tongue off of his neck, discovering at the last second that now he is dangling by one foot from the railing.<br/><br/>"Brother, we will help you! Hetep is mad, it is true--he culls too many of the Brothers." The crowd helps him down. "The great gods are coming tonight! Come, Brother!"<br/><br/>Speaking his best rough Egyptian Arabic, Freddie mutters, "I was worried I would be f***ing late."<br/><br/>Hetep shrinks back to cat size and crawls sickeningly up its own tongue.<br/><br/>It is soon apparent why the crowd did not think Freddie's appearance to be unusual--he's not the only man in evening clothes in the crowd; he recognizes several high-ranking Egyptian government officials, as well as some Europeans.<br/><br/>As Pearkes walks through the halls, he stumbles upon Billy.<br/><br/>"Colonel, where are you going?"<br/><br/>"To the wives' quarters."<br/><br/>"Oh no, sir, oh no. Don't go there sir, they're terrible sir."<br/><br/>"Don't really have much choice, Billy. Help me."<br/><br/>"What should I do, sir?"<br/><br/>"Whatever it takes. Knock me out."<br/><br/>"All right, sir...."<br/><br/>After dithering for a second, Billy shouts a Pashtun battle cry and leaps on Pearkes, tackling him.<br/><br/>"That's it, Billy. Keep going!"<br/><br/>Billy grabs a heavy vase. "Sorry sir!"<br/><br/>He bashes Pearkes on the skull.<br/><br/>The colonel comes to in a back room of some kind. A rickety table holds some half-finished glasses of tea and the remains of card games--both playing and tarot cards litter the surface.<br/><br/>Some yellow robes hang from pegs on the wall.<br/><br/>"Sorry sir. Sorry sir. Sorry sir. Billy's sorry, sir."<br/><br/>"It's all right Billy. Do you have anything for my head?"<br/><br/>"I'll make you a glass, sir. A nice cuppa will do you well."<br/><br/>Sipping his mint tea, Pearkes takes out his VC and thinks back on what he had to do to earn it, and all the good men he saw fall. He feels a renewed sense of purpose as the last traces of the spell falls from him.<br/><br/><i>[PP called for a Symbol stability refresh--I was so proud.

Pearkes whistles appreciatively: hanging on racks on the wall are hundreds of guns of all kinds of makes and models.<br/><br/>Then he pauses, considering. Shakhti has hundreds of servants, many of whom serve him unwillingly. And yet the door to the gun room has no lock. He either does not worry about them rising against him--or he has no fear of ordinary weapons.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Any light civilian arm you can find automatically.

Allowing players narrative control is a cruel mistress...]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes tries to hand Billy the gun. "Take this."<br/><br/>Billy boggles. "I can't carry that! It's heavier than a dead Pashtun!"<br/><br/>"Fine then, carry the ammo."<br/><br/>Billy slides into the shoulder straps, muttering in Pashtun. He and Pearkes begin to look for a convenient window to set up the gun. Occasionally a cultist looks at him, but Pearkes imperiously declares "Hetep!" and strides past.<br/><br/>\u201cHow come he gets a machine gun?\u201d one of them asks his supervisor. Astonished, the supervisor heads off to find the Bey.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Freddie has decided to pass himself off as a confused Turkish official. He grabs someone from the crowd and demands that he help him find his room.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance buy from FP to fast talk his way out of the crowd.]</i><br/><br/>They go up to Pearkes' room, but the Colonel is of course missing.<br/><br/>"Wait, you are the English?"<br/><br/>"No, I must have the wrong room."<br/><br/>"Well, hurry. I'm late to bash in some brains. And the Old Gods are coming tonight."<br/><br/>"What do you think I want to do? But I don't have my club. How can I participate without it?"<br/><br/>Dithering, the cultist finally decides to leave Freddie on his own. "Hurry, or you will be late."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance from FP, again.]</i><br/><br/>Relieved, Freddie decides to go and collect Dr. Mwimbe. He swings out onto the railing and begins to climb up on the roof. Unfortunately, he loses his grip several times and ends up taking a long time to clamber up on the roof. Some people in the crowd below point at him and chatter loudly in Arabic.<br/><br/>Freddie rolls over the roofline and begins to crawl towards the Wives' Quarters.<br/><br/><i>[Failed Athletics roll by FP; I decided it was better to let him succeed with consequences than just fail. He made a Stealth roll to get back out of sight, but folks were looking for him.]</i><br/><br/>Billy and Pearkes reach the Hall of Nephren-Ka. "We have to go through there, sir, to get to the garage or the residence. Unless we go up on the roof, sir."<br/><br/>"Come on, then, Billy."<br/><br/>"Billy don't like this, sir. Billy don't like it one bit..."<br/><br/>As they cross the dimly lit room, there is an ominous <i>scrrrrape</i> from one of the sarcophagi. <br/><br/>"Right," says Pearkes. "The roof it is!" He glances around. Billy has already fled, leaving the ammo boxes.

In d20, the social contract is that the opposition is ultimately not as powerful as the group combined (that's the meaning of Challenge Rating, after all.) And our CoC game was very heroic.<br/><br/>While I'm happy running a pulp game, where the PCs can have a reasonable expectation that they can settle all difficulties by beating them up, it's important to note that the opposition is <i>significantly</i> more powerful than the PCs, and not afraid to use that power. This comes up later in this session.

A narrow walkway along the outside of the villa keeps him and Billy concealed from the courtyard. Shrieks and cries--of pain and exultation--torture their ears.<br/><br/>Then they hear a new sound. A distant, otherworldly piping, like manic flutes, coming closer, closer.<br/><br/>Billy shrieks, covers his ears, and turns to run.<br/><br/>Pearkes panics for a moment, then fishes into his pockets and digs out some sealing wax. He crams it into his ears.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll from PP, slightly prompted by me. (PP: I'm looking for something like a Will save, so I don't listen. Me: Yeah. It's called a Stability check...) I ruled that blocking his ears would wipe out the +1 to the test TN from being a Mythos shock.]</i><br/><br/>Despite muffling the noise, Pearkes slowly feels his will crumbling. He turns towards the courtyard...<br/><br/>...and sees horrible, froglike beings materializing out of thin air, playing long, alien flutes like maniacs. They approach the obelisk, where naked men and women have been chained to the iron rings, and proceed to violate them in the most obscene and disgusting manner possible. The poor humans are literally rent to pieces.<br/><br/>Pearkes feels his sanity reel.<br/><br/><i>[So despite that, PP blew the 5-point Stability test anyway, dropping him to -1 and thus dropping his Sanity by 1. (I offered him the fainting route, but quoth PP: "George doesn't faint!"]</i><br/><br/>Billy begins to run away, but Pearkes tackles him and forces him down the ladder and back into the villa.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the other side of the courtyard, Freddie creeps along the roof. He too hears the otherworldly music. "My goodness, that's terrible," he thinks. "That's not even <i>twelve-tone</i>." He takes out the custom pair of earplugs he had made for concerts, lectures, and political rallies and puts them in. Humming bits from "The Merry Widow," he continues towards the Wives' Quarters.<br/><br/><i>[Freddie also has a high Preparedness, and made his Stability roll.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie rolls over the roofline as he approaches the Residence section of the villa. "Dash it all, there was a walkway the whole time." As he slides onto it, he sees a man in a yellow robe tackling another man across the courtyard. Shrugging, he opens a trapdoor and climbs down a ladder to the Wives' Quarters.<br/><br/><i>[I gave Freddie a Stability refresh from his Drive here--it's bad luck to head completely the opposite direction of the the rest of the Party.<br/><br/>BTW, GP couldn't make it this time, and CP was late, which is why the early part of the session is only about Freddie and Colonel Pearkes.]</i><br/><br/>The ladder ends in a sheltered bay just off a main corridor. He risks a quick glance around the corner. Two huge men, whom he takes to be eunuchs, are standing in front of an elaborate door. Their scimitars are particularly long and sharp.<br/><br/>Freddie shudders, and then thinks back to a night in Paris, during the war, when he and Jackson had fled across the rooftops from the gendarmes. He smiles, and then turns the corner.<br/><br/><i>[FP invoked his symbol here.]</i><br/><br/>Striding up to the guards, Freddie puts on his best arrogant aristocrat voice and says in Arabic, "I am here for my wife."<br/><br/>"Your...wife?"<br/><br/>"Yes. The Mwimbe woman. Bring her to me swiftly!"<br/><br/>The guards glance at each other uneasily. Finally, one says "Wait here," and goes through the door.<br/><br/>Freddie scowls at the other guard, who shifts nervously. The faint sounds of a angry conversation come through the door.<br/><br/>Finally the first guard returns. "She comes."<br/><br/>After a moment, Dr. Mwimbe steps out.<br/><br/>"Come, woman." Freddie strides imperiously away.<br/><br/>Mwimbe follows. "But--"<br/><br/>"Not now, my wife. Do not dishonor me by speaking. We are late for the ceremony."<br/><br/>After they turn a corner, Mwimbe hisses at Freddie: "You are in enormous danger."<br/><br/>"Yes, I've already been strangled by a cat."<br/><br/>"Ah, Hetep. Of course."<br/><br/>"You know, we must talk about this more when we are safer."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pearkes climbs down the ladder, spouting racial insults directed at the cultists. He shoves Billy up to the entrance to the Hall of Nephren-Ka. "You're going in there with me, Billy. You're going to pick up that ammo."<br/><br/>"No! No, no, no!" screams Billy. He lapses into Arabic. "La, la, la!"<br/><br/>"You're going to pick up that ammo, then we are going to set up in the next room and you will take out all your anger on the cult."<br/><br/>"Billy's not angry, Billy just wants to go home."<br/><br/>"The way home is through there. You want to go home, don't you?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Billy wants to go home but not through there. I don't want to go in there."<br/><br/>"Then you don't want to go home, then! Pick it up!"<br/><br/>"No! No! We'll go back to the cloakroom, we'll get the cars."<br/><br/>"You said that the only way was through this room!"<br/><br/>"We can go back out on the roof, I thought that's what we were doing before...Billy's scared."<br/><br/>"Is that what they said before Waterloo?"<br/><br/>"The French, maybe!"<br/><br/><i>[I ruled that Billy's Sanity was so fried that the only way to get him to go in the room was to make some kind of Interpersonal spend, but Pearkes' hurt Stability kept him from doing so.]</i><br/><br/>Exasperated, Pearkes studies the room himself, then dashes in. He makes a perfect sliding tackle to sweep by the ammo boxes and scoop them up, then shoulders the gun and scrambles for the door a the other end of the hall, dragging the ammo boxes.<br/><br/><i>[After much discussion, I ruled a 2-point Athletics spend would allow Pearkes to pick up both boxes of ammo (otherwise he could only get one--altogether the boxes and machine gun weigh well north of a hundred pounds.) He then spent his last two points of Athletics to try and reach the exit before getting caught by, as I put it it, multiple opponents.]</i><br/><br/>Just short of the door, he feels the heavy touch of a hand on his shoulder. One of the mummies has left its sarcophagus and has grabbed him; the other four are just behind.<br/><br/>Swinging the Browning amidships, Pearkes executes a precise cross-check on the lead mummy, knocking him backwards into his companions. The Colonel flops backwards, scrambling with his legs into the room beyond. A swift kick slams the door shut, and the bar drops neatly into place.<br/><br/><i>[Scuffling spend by PP, and I used NBA's rules for pushing/throwing opponents.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414333/#Comment_414333" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-19T15:16:16+00:00" title="May 19, 2013  3:16PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's a bit weird, with regard to the aunts; I previously told FP that I wasn't sure they aunts could be Sources, because I am obligated to threaten Sources, and I couldn't think of <i>anything</i>--even in the Mythos--that could threaten Bertie Wooster's aunts.<br/><br/>Of course, I could just agree with FP, and simply never have the aunts move anywhere; but that seems a bit underhanded :-)</blockquote>\nAh, I see -- genre clash.

If I kill 'em off, then we're back to Lovecraft, but I've drop-kicked FPs vision. So in that a sense, they could actually work as a Safety, given that the Aunts never leave wherever the heck it is that they live; especially so since NBA explicitly notes that visiting the Safety basically burns it and puts your contacts there in danger. So that could work--they Mythos can't hurt them unless Freddie brings it to their door.<br/><br/>In any case, you can see me developing a line among the NPCs that Freddie simply can't be as stupid as he appears, and since he's played by FP, I think that will eventually bear out. (Despite FP not caring for Bertie's sketch, the Wodehouse character Reggie, Freddie is much more like Reggie than Bertie--he develops his own schemes, and they tend to work.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414344/#Comment_414344" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-19T22:52:27+00:00" title="May 19, 2013 10:52PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, then, that one thing to do for post-modern play is to decide which genre takes precedence when there are clashes or whether there will just be a disconnect and how it will be handled in play.

"Mwimbe, I like the look! Very conservative."<br/><br/>"Good God, man," says Freddie. "Why on Earth are you carrying around plumbing supplies?"<br/><br/>"It's a gun, Freddie."<br/><br/>"Goodness, that's the biggest gun I've ever seen! And who's your friend?"<br/><br/>"This is Billy. We served together in the war."<br/><br/>"Ah, then I feel sorry for you, Billy."<br/><br/>"Lor' bless you, guv'ner."<br/><br/>"I say, Colonel. Will that <i>thing</i> kill Bedouins?"<br/><br/>"Why not?" says Mwimbe bitterly. "Brownings have been killing Africans for decades."<br/><br/>"Say, Mwimbe, I thought you didn't like Bedouins?"<br/><br/>"What? No, they are an oppressed people, we should all work together."<br/><br/>The group makes their way down into the cloakroom. Billy leads them into the basement. They ignore the vast spaces around them, filled with who knows what horrors, and enter a narrow tunnel that leads, according to Billy, to the garage.<br/><br/>After a while, they emerge into a spacious building filled with modern vehicles--touring cars, limousines, motorcycles, and even a half-ton truck. In one of the touring cars they find Charleston and Gilbert, passed out (or drugged.)<br/><br/>"Didn't you tell me Bedouins attacked your village?" says Freddie, picking up the conversation again.<br/><br/>"Bedouins? No. It was the the British who attacked. Just one more atrocity they have committed against Africans."<br/><br/>"Oh, I see. But you're Zanzibari, yes?"<br/><br/>"Of course."<br/><br/>"And part Persian?"<br/><br/>"Yes, yes. I have Persian ancestry..."<br/><br/>"But aren't Persians white?"<br/><br/>"I...you..."<br/><br/>As she sputters, Freddie turns to find the Colonel, who has commandeered the truck and is searching for a bracket to attach the Browning to the back.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll by PP. I was a bit relieved over this use of the Browning--massacring the courtyard was pushing my boundaries a bit.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie jumps in the cab, and they roar out into the darkness.<br/><br/>In the truck bed, Pearkes convinces Dr. Mwimbe to hypnotize him in an effort to put his mind at rest. After a while, he wakes from a trance feeling relieved.<br/><br/><i>[I don't generally give the NPCs useful skills unless the PCs have them as well, but this fit into my overall plan so it wasn't a problem.]</i><br/><br/>As they turn towards the road that leads back to Cairo, they behold a large crowd of the plantation's workers, holding torches. "Shakhti...Shakhti...Shakhti..." they chant. Freddie shifts gears and tears off across the fields, making for the open desert.<br/><br/>Soon they notice a cloud of dust behind them, and then catch the faint noise of engines. A crowd of motorcycles is pursuing them, with a half-ton truck in the middle. Mounted on the truck is a wicked looking Browning Automatic Rifle.<br/><br/>Freddie glances back and then nails the gas pedal to the floor. Meanwhile, Pearkes opens up with the .50 cal, scattering the motorcycles.<br/><br/><i>[I wanted to use the chase rules from NBA, but then blew it by giving Freddie and company too big a lead; I didn't have to, but decided to stick to my original formula for calculating the lead (something like Skill Test-4) because I had other content in wait, and wasn't sure how exciting a chase would be. PP used the suppression fire rules from NBA, which worked well enough. In any case, any spends are useful in lowering PC resources!<br/><br/>FP was using Fleeing here, not driving. He had a few points in Driving, so I was okay with that; Fleeing should be broadly useful in my opinion, although I'll consider the ratings in other skills for things besides pure running.]</i><br/><br/>The BAR opens up. Shrapnel flies into Pearkes' face as bullets chew up the truck bed, but he is largely unhurt as they escape into the darkness.<br/><br/>They drive for a few hours in the mysterious silence of the desert. As dawn approaches, they pass into a dry wash that offers them some cover. Suddenly, Freddie jerks over the wheel, having seen a glint from one of the rock outcroppings. Moments later a shot rings out, and the front tire of the truck blows out.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble by FP, followed by a driving roll. The assailants had more than enough Firearms to make the called shot, but the Sense Trouble success prevented a messy crash.]</i><br/><br/>"Freddie of the English!" a voice calls out.<br/><br/>"Ah, hello?"<br/><br/>Shots ring down at the truck, pinning everyone inside it.<br/><br/>"It is I, Wazim. If you surrender now, we will give you a quick death. Or, you can wait until sunrise, and we will attack. You will have a chance to die with honor!"<br/><br/>"Well, that's an interesting offer. Why don't we make an agreement, and then we will break all our promises, and probably kill you in the process!"<br/><br/>"Ha! You amuse me, Freddie! Dawn it is, then!"<br/><br/>The sun slowly climbs over the horizon. There is a sudden violent shaking all around them, followed by the screams of horses and men.<br/><br/>Wazim and three other Bedouin dash across the sand and jump in the truck bed next to Pearkes.<br/><br/>"Look!" pants the Bedouin leader.<br/><br/>Tentacles erupt out of the sand, linked to a horrendous squid-like body. One tentacle lashes out at one of the Bedouin, and a hideous sucking noise ensues. The man grows pale as his vital fluids are drained by the bizarre creature.<br/><br/><i>[Homebrew conversion of a Cthonian, summoned by Shakhti Bey to finish off the PCs. Not a full-adult, but still plenty tough.]</i><br/><br/>Billy screams and jumps out of the truck.<br/><br/><i>[Me: He served in Afghanistan. His fleeing is very high. (This is a comment on contemporaneous British experience in the Big A, of course, not that of our time.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie slides into the truck bed and begins to look around for something to use against the creature. He grabs a gas can and throws it in the air. A tentacle catches it and the can collapses in on itself as it is drained.<br/><br/>Tossing a flare pistol he found at Pearkes, Freddie tells him to shoot at the gas-filled tentacle.<br/><br/><i>[FP made a bunch of neat Preparedness checks here.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes jumps off the truck and strides towards the creature. The tentacle drops the empty can and lashes out towards him.<br/><br/>Pearkes fires the flare gun. The tentacle explodes, and the creature shrieks.<br/><br/><i>[PP used Intimidation here to get a combat bonus on the called shot, which I thought was neat.]</i><br/><br/>Wazim mans the Browning and opens up on the creature, but fails to significantly damage it. The remaining Bedouin also open fire, but both are hit by tentacles.<br/><br/><i>[FP: Eventually we will run out of ablative Bedouin.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie kicks open a box in the back of the truck bed. Like any good farmer, Shakhti maintains a stock of dynamite. Freddie takes the sticks out, unsure how to use them. Wazim grabs them from him and begins to mount the fuses.<br/><br/>Pearkes and the old Bedouin launch lit dynamite sticks at the creature. A tentacle blows off. The thing writhes in pain.<br/><br/>It throws a tentacle at Pearkes, who falls to his knees in agony as the creature begins to suck him dry.<br/><br/>Freddie tosses more dynamite. The Bedouin open up again with their rifles. Finally Pearkes throws his last stick. The explosion knocks him down, but the creature, having lost another tentacle, turns away and burrows into the sand.<br/><br/>Everyone heaves a sigh of relief, except for the remaining heavily-wounded Bedouin.<br/><br/>"What...what could have caused a jinn of the desert to attack us, Freddie?" gasps Wazim.<br/><br/>"I would say it was the man you work for."<br/><br/>"What? Truly you say this? That Shakhti Bey called up the jinn?"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid so, old sport."<br/><br/>"Give me your word as an English...wait. As a gentleman. I've known too many Englishmen."<br/><br/>"I give you my word, sir."<br/><br/>Wazim ponders this. "Well, then, to hell with the Sheikh! I work for Freddie Blakely now!"<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414475/#Comment_414475" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-21T16:01:28+00:00" title="May 21, 2013  4:01PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I think you hit on something the group is still coming to grips with. With the exception of the original Call of Cthulhu game me, FP, and PP played in, we've been a d20 group. In d20, the social contract is that the opposition is ultimately not as powerful as the group combined (that's the meaning of Challenge Rating, after all.) And our CoC game was very heroic.<br/><br/>While I'm happy running a pulp game, where the PCs can have a reasonable expectation that they can settle all difficulties by beating them up, it's important to note that the opposition is <i>significantly</i> more powerful than the PCs, and not afraid to use that power. This comes up later in this session. It also means I finally stumbled on the way to keep FP's natural machinations working with, rather than overriding, the story.<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, this caused some mismatched expectations for us, as well.  The default Amber expectation is that characters with Amber blood can walk all over characters from a 'shadow' world like Earth.  The players did eventually figure out that the presence of Cthulu cultists meant that their real opposition wasn't actually from earth (we ruled that both Shakti and M'Weru had some otherworldly blood).  IIRC, we had to hint at this a bit harder than we had hoped to.  <br/><br/>Sadly, that campaign died of scheduling issues before they made it to the Far East.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414482/#Comment_414482" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-21T16:26:09+00:00" title="May 21, 2013  4:26PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pity.

I agree with Lisa, that sounds pretty epic.<br/><br/>Whether the players realize it or not, the power level I'm basically going for is that as a group they have a chance to take on Big Bads (albeit with risk), but <i>organizationally</i> the opposition is much stronger. Shakhti has, like, oodles and oodles of cultists and his group has penetrated both the Egyptian and British administrations; it's trivial for him to allocate a large amount of spies to watch the PCs and seek out any hidey-holes. (And he gets to use racism and imperialism against him, under the old "nobody notices the servants" method of intelligence gathering.)<br/><br/>FP is generally very good at moving the pawns around the chessboard, but here my basic stance is that when not opposed by POV characters, the conspiracy generally succeeds at whatever they want to do. FP hasn't quite grasped this, I think; or maybe he's used to the Pathfinder campaigns we've been in where magic allowed him to be in multiple places at once. (Curiously, they haven't tried using technology, although there's some obvious ways it could be used--radios to allow the PCs to be "in" multiple places at once, airplanes to allow for quick reaction and air superiority, etc.) Like I said, this comes up towards the end of the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414529/#Comment_414529" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-22T08:01:38+00:00" title="May 22, 2013  8:01AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Champagne and Battle Cries, Just in Time For Sunrise (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>With the help of Wazim, and Qusay, the remaining Bedouin, the truck is soon repaired and they all drive into Cairo together. The city is a hornet's nest of resentment and open riot: although the Wafd won a clear majority of the seats in Parliament, rumors are already circulating that the King will never allow a government headed by Zaghloul to take power.<br/><br/><i>[Actual historical event; the constitutional crisis dragged on for years, with several Royalist puppet prime ministers ruling by decree. We decided that thanks to Freddie, the election was even more one-sided and resentment obviously higher.<br/><br/>In case I haven't mentioned it, the campaign officially takes place in an alternate timeline, so I am not beholden to historical events, although the divergence is currently pretty low. (The one that I know about is that Walter Rathenau was not assassinated in 1921 and is currently a candidate for Chancellor of the Weimar Republic.]</i><br/><br/>Arriving at Shepheard's, they push into the salon, dust from the desert shaking off of them. Wazim glares at the soft Europeans, while the wounded Pearkes puts on his best stiff upper lip.<br/><br/><i>[I told the players to visualize the scene in every action movie where the heroes come striding in, filmed in slow motion.]</i><br/><br/>"Ah, Mr. Freddie!" says the bartender. "I heard you were dead. Good to see that you're still with us. There's somebody you should meet--"<br/><br/>Just then Sheila runs up to Freddie. "Mr. Blakely!" She grabs him into a tight embrace.<br/><br/>"I say, Abigail--"<br/><br/>She pushes him away and slaps him. "Don't ever do that to me again! I thought you were <i>dead</i>!" She breaks down.<br/><br/>"Hah!" shouts Wazim, in Arabic. "He cannot control his [gender slur]."<br/><br/>"She's not my concubine," replies Freddie in the same language. "She's my assistant."<br/><br/>"Ah, I do not hold with these 'Modern Women'. My daughter is one such. She lives in the city, studies at the university, has forgotten our ways."<br/><br/>Freddie quietly orders Sheila a drink. "So who is it I should meet?" he asks the bartender.<br/><br/>The bartender nods at a tweedy, donnish-looking man sitting at the end of the bar. He glances up at Freddie, light reflecting on his thick glasses and his bristlebrush mustache curling up into a smile. "I say, Freddie Blakely!"<br/><br/>"Indeed. And who do I owe the pleasure?'<br/><br/>"Clive, sir, Dr. Henry Clive, of what they're calling the Clive Expedition. Sent down here from Paris by the Penhew Foundation people, don't you know."<br/><br/>"Quite. What brings you to Cairo?"<br/><br/>"Just a bit of R &amp; R, up from the digs. I hear you're quite the man to talk to up here."<br/><br/>"Everybody says that, but I really don't know why."<br/><br/>Freddie studies Clive with the cold condescension of the gentry. Although the man affects a plummy Oxbridge accent, it's clear to Freddie that he's not well-born, however much he obviously strives to be perceived as such.<br/><br/><i>[Freddie's Credit Rating is absurdly high, so I gave this to him.]</i><br/><br/>Soon Clive and Freddie fall into reminiscences about Oxford; it turns out they were both at Exeter College. "I say, do you remember old Tolky?"<br/><br/>"You mean Jerry?"<br/><br/>"No, Johnny."<br/><br/>"Yes, John Tolkien. Called him Jerry from his initials."<br/><br/>"That's the one! Daft old chap.<br/><br/>"Always spouting off about Welsh and Finnish."<br/><br/>"Never amount to much."<br/><br/>A sandy-haired man in his twenties sits down next to Clive. He has a smug expression that Freddie and Pearkes immediately dislike.<br/><br/>"Ah, Blakely, this is my man Winfield. Dr. Martin Winfield, Freddie Blakely, Colonel George Pearkes."<br/><br/>"Charmed," says Winfield smoothly. Pearkes eyes him cautiously. It's obvious to him that this man is a killer, one who has killed before and will kill again--the type of man, in short, who relishes delivering pain.<br/><br/><i>[Gave this to free to PP based on his military career. Winfield is a piece of work, no doubt.]</i><br/><br/>"So how goes the dig, gentlemen?" asks Freddie.<br/><br/>"Smashing," says Clive. "We dug up in Giza first, you know. Found an ancient burial chamber for a queen near the Great Pyramid. Looks like it was a reburial, you know; scrolls indicated that the mummy wasn't anybody special. But, here's the damnedest thing, the mummy got stolen! Bloody grave robbers. Since then we've kept our security high, especially since we moved down to Luxor to work on excavating a temple.<br/><br/>"But you know, Freddie, I'm wondering what brings you here to Cairo?"<br/><br/>"Oh, the usual, seeing the sights, helping out Dr. Mwimbe there."<br/><br/>"I know her by reputation."<br/><br/>"Yes. Well, the thing is, I'm planning to marry her."<br/><br/>Clive looks agahast. "But, old man, that's simply not <i>done</i>!"<br/><br/>"Certainly not in England. Which is why, you see, I'm in Cairo."<br/><br/>Clive and Winfield boggle together. "That seems...quite <i>dubious</i>, old sport. Are you sure you know what you're up to?"<br/><br/>"I'm never sure, actually. Oh, have you heard about that railroad they're trying to build from Egypt to Persia?"<br/><br/>Clive blinks. "That...that would be of critical importance to the Empire."<br/><br/>"Quite. A man could get very rich, were he to invest in such a thing. Of course, I have no interests in such a venture. I understand the negotiations with Persia are very tricky."<br/><br/>"A railroad, you say," mutters Clive. He and Winfield exchange glances.<br/><br/>"I believe Dr. Mwimbe is part Persian," says Winfield.<br/><br/>"Is she? Small world. Well, we should probably let you get on. I hope you'll let me call on you down by the dig, if I'm ever in the area."<br/><br/>"Of course, sir! It would be our pleasure." Clive and Winfield excuse themselves and head to their rooms.<br/><br/>"Allison," says Freddie to Sheila, "Do I own any railroad stock?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>"Amazing. Do you think I could buy some more? Here in Egypt?"<br/><br/>"I...I don't know, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>"Could you find out?"<br/><br/>"I'll ask around to see if I can get you access to the Bourse, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>"Excellent."<br/><br/>Freddie goes to Mwimbe's room. <br/><br/>"Yes, Mr. Blakely?"<br/><br/>"Hello, Mwimbe. Hope you're relaxing after your ordeal. Oh, by the way, I may have given it out that you and I are going to get married. But if anyone asks, I need you to tell them that it's absolutely not true."<br/><br/>"That should not be very difficult at all, Mr. Blakey."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414530/#Comment_414530" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-22T08:06:32+00:00" title="May 22, 2013  8:06AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Incidentally, the Egypt to India railroad was an actual British ambition of the period; it was ultimately thwarted by Persia not granting thruway rights, mostly because of Russian interference.

in 1925. We weren't clear in play about whether he was a teacher or not, but for the transcript I've made it clear he was a fellow student.<br/><br/>I tend to stick in as many historical personage cameos as I can, because its a joy of historical RPing or historical fiction; you want to meet these guys. Provided it doesn't strain things too much, I think it adds to the game.<br/><br/>Of course, that could just be me. My first CoC character was an East Tennessee lesbian tomboy aviatrix (thus my handle) who had what I liked to call "Six Degrees of Joyce Summers" (that being her name.) I used to drop into casual conversation how she had met somebody who wasn't famous yet in the 1920s (or was famous, but she didn't recognize him), usually to the groans of the other players.<br/><br/>"Met a fella down at the speakeasy last night. Said his name was George, and he played for the Yankees, but I didn't believe him. Too fat to be an athlete."<br/><br/>"Ernie? Yeah, I met him in Paris at Scott's place when I was there for the airshow. Think he's compensating for something."<br/><br/>"Lindbergh? That peckerwood? That boy is in more dire need of a **** *** than any white man in history."<br/><br/>Und so weiter :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414571/#Comment_414571" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-22T19:21:59+00:00" title="May 22, 2013  7:21PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And hey, page 3!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414618/#Comment_414618" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T10:34:54+00:00" title="May 23, 2013 10:34AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Champagne and Battle Cries, Just in Time For Sunrise (Part 7)</b><br/><br/><i>25 March 1925</i><br/><br/>The next day Sheila reports back that she has located a man who can help Freddie buy stocks on the Egyptian Bourse: Nigel Wassif, the editor of the <i>Cairo Bulletin</i>, a local newspaper that focuses on celebrity gossip.<br/><br/>Freddie checks in on Wazim and Qusay. They have transformed their room into a fair imitation of a tent. <br/><br/>"Well, Wazim, are you enjoying yourself?"<br/><br/>"Bah. The son of a camel downstairs told me I could not bring my gun upstairs. I pointed out that his head would barely stop my scimitar."<br/><br/>"I could see how that might make him more amenable. I like what you've done with the room."<br/><br/>"It was Qusay. He is skilled in these arts!"<br/><br/>"Qusay, I'm impressed. If you ever decide to give up hitting people on the head as a trade, you could do very well for yourself as a decorator."<br/><br/>"That is such a stereotype of the Bedouin lifestyle! I am not a violent man. Although, if people insist on crossing our territory without paying the tolls, a man is justified..."<br/><br/>Wazim snorts. "They are too soft here. People should not live in cities. I could take fifty...no, fifty-two of these soft Egyptians."<br/><br/>"I think you'll find, Wazim, that even if you can take out fifty-two, the fifty-third will probably kill you."<br/><br/>"Bah. If it is written, what can I do."<br/><br/><i>[FP: I like Wazim.<br/>Me: Yeah, well, he kinda lives like a murderhobo PC. (in Wazim voice) "I killed your waiter. And took his wallet."<br/>FP: Just goes to show how psychopathic the average PC is.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston is feeling better by this point, so they motor down to the offices of the <i>Bulletin</i>. Nigel Wassif turns out to be a handsome man with impeccable English. He wears the most fashionable of suits. Offering his guests whiskey, he turns and toasts a large portrait of George V.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, the King."<br/><br/>"And to King Fuad," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Of course, although I must confess a certain affection for George. I was born in England, you know."<br/><br/>"We were all born in in England," says Pearkes, who is a Canadian immigrant.<br/><br/>Charleston shrugs.<br/><br/>"My mother was a chambermaid for the King," continues Wassif. "She got to know him quite intimately."<br/><br/>Freddie glances at Wassif, then studies the portrait for a long time. "You know, I think I knew your brother Bertie at school."<br/><br/>"I...have no brother."<br/><br/>"No, of course not, of course not. So I was wondering if you could help me conduct some business on the Bourse..."<br/><br/>"Yes, yes, my man of business is very capable. But it strikes me that this is not why you are in Egypt."<br/><br/>"No?"<br/><br/>"It strikes me that much like Jackson Elias, you are here following the trail of the Carlyle Expedition."<br/><br/>"Ah. Bit of a bunch of stuffed shirts, weren't they?"<br/><br/>"They were strange people, to be sure. I covered them extensively. They were good press.<br/><br/>"Carlyle was the strangest, him and the woman M'Weru. She always wore an Egyptian burial mask. Was most disconcerting."<br/><br/>Charleston thumbs through a set of clippings about the Carlyles. He notices something strange. "These pictures--they claim to have been taken a month apart, but the date on the calendar is the same! You recycled them?"<br/><br/>Wassif shrugs. "To tell the truth, Roger Carlyle ended up not being very useful to me. He spent a great deal of time sick in his hotel room. Often when I watched his hotel, I would see the shadow of a woman in the room."<br/><br/>"Miss Masters?" asks Freddie.<br/><br/>"Perhaps. Certainly they gave out that he and Miss Masters were involved with each other. As men of the world, however, I think you understand how unlikely that was."<br/><br/>"M'Weru, then."<br/><br/>"Perhaps; or perhaps a third woman. I do not know. In any case, one day the Carlyles were simply gone; nobody saw them for over a month, until they suddenly reappeared in Zanzibar, on their way to Tanganyika. I often reused photographs of them during this period."<br/><br/>"I see...and now the Clives seem to be following in the Carlyle Expedition's trail."<br/><br/>"Indeed. You do not believe, of course, Dr. Clive's ridiculous story about the mummy that was stolen. My sources tell me that Clive identified it easily enough--the remains of Queen Nitocris, of evil legend."<br/><br/>"Yes, we've heard of her. Why the deception, then?"<br/><br/>"The Cult of the Black Pharaoh no doubt has interest in her. They have been gathering of late, near the Sphinx; they seem to be planning something very big. And that is very bad news, gentlemen; it means Shakhti Bey himself is involved."<br/><br/>"We've enjoyed his hospitality."<br/><br/>"Then you are lucky to still be alive. I tell you, sirs: the man is pure evil."<br/><br/>When they get back to the hotel, Freddie asks the concierge to send Shakhti a bottle of champagne, with a note:\n<blockquote>Shakhti Bey,<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thank you for an unforgettable evening. I apologize for leaving without speaking to you, but I think you'll agree the circumstances left me little choice. I'm returning a bottle of champagne to you.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Roland Blakely, Esq.<br/><br/>PS If you're ever in New York, don't drop by.</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414666/#Comment_414666" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T21:04:53+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  9:04PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2013 9:07PM by Aviatrix.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Champagne and Battle Cries, Just in Time For Sunrise (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>When they return to Shepheard's, Mwimbe speaks privately to Charleston.

I just want a piece of whatever you're planning."<br/><br/>"Why do you think I'm planning anything?"<br/><br/>Anton languidly gestures at the tools with his cigarette. "Hey, it's all right, you ignore that I'm robbing the guests here blind, I ignore your little projects. But I'd like a piece. I can help out, drive or serve as a lookout."<br/><br/><i>[Anton is GP's Solace, so I was slightly uncomfortable using him to help Charleston. However, logically he'd be in on it, and Charleston definitely needed some assistance. I planned to give Anton some slight plot immunity.]</i><br/><br/>"Fine. You can drive. Just understand--I keep anything with writing on it."<br/><br/>Later that night, Anton pulls up in a late-model Rolls Royce. "Don't worry, I stole it."<br/><br/>"Real subtle! Everybody is going to see us!"<br/><br/>"Au contraire. They will see a rich Chinese businessman and his chauffeur. And people here are trained not to stare at wealth."<br/><br/>Charleston inspects the car. "Is this going to be big enough?"<br/><br/>"Big enough? It's a Rolls! Look, you steal the small stuff that is very valuable! What do you want, to steal a sarcophagus?"<br/><br/>"If it has writing on it--weren't you paying attention?"<br/><br/>"We can steal a sarcophagus, but I'll need more guys. I can get them for you..."<br/><br/>"Scope creep," sighs Charleston, shaking his head.<br/><br/>They drive to the Egyptian Museum and pull up at the kitchen. The door easily springs, and they slip into the museum. Evading the patrols is slightly harder, but for two such experienced thieves there is little danger.<br/><br/><i>[I only called for one check here; they're good at what they do, and Cairo is pretty chaotic at this point.]</i><br/><br/>They arrive at Kafour's office. A massive safe dominates one corner. Someone is moving around inside, very quietly.<br/><br/>"Would a mummy ransack an office?" mutters Charleston. <br/><br/>Anton creeps away. "Sorry, I am what you call, a coward."<br/><br/>Charleston steps into the office..<br/><br/>He sees a cloaked figure whose face is obscured with a scarf. Charleston gestures with his Thomspon. "Easy, easy. Who are you."<br/><br/>"I am Noor. I was Dr. Kafour's assistant!"<br/><br/>"And why are you here?"<br/><br/>"Because I seek truth. That is why I work for Dr. Kafour."<br/><br/>"And how did you get past the guards?"<br/><br/>"She's a Bedouin," says Anton. "Brigands of the desert."<br/><br/>"I am not a brigand! That is a sterotype--"<br/><br/>"Look, I was a hired assassin for the Triads. So we're all brigands here."<br/><br/>"Really?" says Anton. "Did you know Mr. Lee?"<br/><br/>"This is not the time," says Noor. "There are many dangerous books here. I came to make them safe."<br/><br/>Charleston gives her a searching look. "Have you found anything?"<br/><br/>"The most valuable items are kept in the safe. I have disabled the spell, I think, but I don't know the combination."<br/><br/>Charleston begins to work on the safe. With Noor's help, he manages to open it in a few hours. Inside are many talismans and obscure objets d'art, and several books. Noor grabs for one, but Charleston takes it from her.<br/><br/>The book has been rebound several times, but the pages are immensely old. The writing inside seems to be Arabic.<br/><br/>Charleston recognizes the book from his occult studies. The <i>Al Azif.</i><br/><br/>The Arabic <i>Necronomicon</i>, written by Abd al-Hazrad himself.<br/><br/>"Be very careful with that book, sir. It is very evil and very powerful. Dr. Kafour very rarely let anyone look at it. I myself only got a brief glance at it once."<br/><br/>Charleston practically drools over it. "We should go somewhere to read it."<br/><br/>"I could help. After all, you have the book, but I speak Arabic! Together we can decipher it."<br/><br/>"I have other books as well."<br/><br/>Noor brightens. "I would be delighted to see your collection."<br/><br/>"You're not frightened of me?"<br/><br/>"I am far more scared of that book."<br/><br/>As they begin to head back to the car, the sounds of a patrol heading their way can be heard. "Run!" says Anton.<br/><br/>Guards shout from behind them, but they dare not fire weapons in the Museum.<br/><br/>Dragging Noor along, Charleston dashes into the Rolls. Anton slides behind the seat and they peel away.<br/><br/>They abandon the car in the Old City. Anton parks it in the road and tosses the keys inside. A short walk later and they are back at Shepheard's. Freddie is playing ragtime at the piano, swigging from a bottle of whiskey in between tunes. Sheila is trying to get him to stand upright, but he valiantly resists.<br/><br/>Charleston takes Noor up to his room. He sweeps the corners, checks the balcony, locks the doors, and checks under the bed. He takes out the books he got from Erica Carlyle, desperate to show off to somebody who understands what they are.<br/><br/>"Ah! The <i>Livre d'Yvon</i>! And <i>Life as a God</i>! That is a very valuable source on the Cult of the Black Pharaoh."<br/><br/>"So let's translate this book into English."<br/><br/>"You cannot be serious! If you read the whole book, you will go mad!"<br/><br/>"I read all these other books."<br/><br/>"This one is worse than all of them put together."<br/><br/>"That's why I saved it for last!"<br/><br/><i>[This is quite </i>literally<i> true; 4-point Sanity loss for the </i>Al-Azif<i>. FP opined that this must be how all the translations happen--some idiot thinks nothing could go wrong.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if Charleston were to succeed at reading the book, his Sanity would drop to 3. However, as CP pointed out, he lost his Pillar of Reason as a result of reading the other books. So this is totally in character.<br/><br/>So: I gave the PCs the most dangerous and valuable Mythos tome there is. I'm actually not all that worried, though. It gives Scary Potter (Charleston) access to a lot of spells, but he still has to </i>cast<i> them and that's not easy. (And I generally require a Mythos spend to get access to a particular spell, rather than some less useful incantation.)]</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414680/#Comment_414680" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-24T08:03:05+00:00" title="May 24, 2013  8:03AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Champagne and Battle Cries, Just in Time For Sunrise (Part 9)</b><br/><br/><i>26 March 1925</i><br/><br/>The next day, Pearkes and Freddie decide to set out to investigate the Clive expedition. Cairo seems a bit too hot for them, especially as Freddie has received a reply to his note: a bottle of champagne, and the message "We will meet again." He forwards the bottle to Mustafa Pasha.<br/><br/>Freddie drops Saad Zahgloul a note telling him he can always count on him for a favor.<br/><br/>Charleston wakes up in his room; at some point during the night he must have finally passed out from fatigue. Half-finished sheets of paper with English and Arabic text litter the table. Noor is asleep, nuzzled up to his shoulder.<br/><br/>He sees a tall Bedouin pass by the door, and then suddenly stop. The man looks back and forth between Charleston and Noor. Then he draws his scimitar.<br/><br/>"You will die for making a [gender slur] of my daughter!"<br/><br/>Charleston picks up his Thompson from where he dropped it next to his chair. "She's not a [gender slur]. Call her that again and I'll perforate you."<br/><br/>"I admire your moxie!" says the Bedouin.<br/><br/>"Ah, Charleston, I see you've met Wazim!" says Freddie, rushing into the room.<br/><br/>"Why does he have my daughter with him?" demands Wazim.<br/><br/>"She's an academician," says Charleston.<br/><br/>"Bah! She left the desert, left our ways, for books!"<br/><br/>"That's because she isn't an idiot like you."<br/><br/>"I expect that she is working with Charleston to loot the museum," explains Freddie.<br/><br/>"These things need to be done properly," says Wazim. "He should have come to me, or her older brother. Or her husband--"<br/><br/>"I'M NOT MARRIED TO HIM YET!" screams Noor.<br/><br/>Freddie introduces everyone, defusing Charleston, who wants to hit the books again after breakfast, but Freddie tells him that he'll have to do it on the boat. "I assure you, Wazim, that Charleston has almost no interest in women at all!"<br/><br/>"Ah! He is like a Circassian!"<br/><br/>"I suppose."<br/><br/>"As your Paul says, 'some men are eunuchs by nature, others are eunuchs for Issa'!"<br/><br/>"Hey!" says Charleston.<br/><br/>"Not at all, Wazim. Charleston likes killing people and taking photographs and not much else."<br/><br/>"If he rode a horse instead of taking photographs, he could be a Bedouin."<br/><br/>Pearkes arranges for all of them to ride down to Luxor on a British military transport (basically, a contracted civilian steamer.)<br/><br/>On the way to the docks, they noticed they are being followed by four men, who wear inverted ankhs. Freddie stops at the harbormaster's office and speaks with the local garrison commander.<br/><br/>"Sir, there are four ruffians out there insulting the honor of both our Sovereign, <i>and the Queen</i>. You'll recognize them easily, as they wear this symbol."<br/><br/>"Right you are, gov. We'll round them up."<br/><br/>As the transport leaves the dock, British MPs grab the four men. Pearkes, displaying his best stiff-upper lip, waves regally at them.<br/><br/>"See you later, a**holes," says Charleston, who's American.<br/><br/>Freddie goes to the purser. "There's something wrong with my cabin. This room is supposed to be it, but it's clearly the walk-in closet! I mean, I can reach across it with arms outstretched!"<br/><br/>Noor and Charleston huddle together in their small stateroom, planning things to do to drive themselves mad.<br/><br/><i>[If you want a comic interlude here, picture Wazim walking by, seeing them sitting together close enough that their knees touch, drawing his scimitar and being restrained by Freddie and Pearkes--all while Charleston obliviously studies on.]</i><br/><br/><i>29 March 1925</i><br/><br/>Three days later, the transport ties up at Luxor in the late afternoon. As it turns out, they are close to a village called El Wasta. According to Warren Besart, this is the home of people who rescued him, an old woman named Nyiti and her son, Unbar.<br/><br/><i>[El Wata is actually much closer to Cairo, but this worked better narratively, especially since I moved the Clive dig from Dhashur to Luxor.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes commandeers some transport--an old British touring car--and they motor off. El Wasta is difficult to find, and the locals give contradictory directions until they finally meet a villager who knows them. <br/><br/>Pulling up at their hovel, they are greeted by a man whose entire right side has been horribly mangled. Using his most patient tones, Freddie manages to understand Unbar's Arabic (his jaw is in terrible shape.) Unbar says that they were expected, and takes them inside.<br/><br/>Nyiti is even worse. She has no jaw at all, and is horribly burned and scarred. Both her hands have been cut off. She looks at each of them in turn, finally settling on Charleston. She makes excited sounds.<br/><br/>"She says you have the eyes of a sorcerer," says Unbar.<br/><br/>Nyiti pulls a heavy basket out from a corner of the room and hands it to Charleston. A blanket covers the contents; when he pulls it back, he finds a strange symbol combining the eye of Horus with an inverted ankh.<br/><br/>"What is this?"<br/><br/>"It positively reeks of magic, Charleston," says Noor.<br/><br/>They motor back in the desert evening towards Luxor. As they pass through a canyon, Charleston suddenly gets a bad feeling. Senses honed by years of Triad warfare do not fail him--as he pulls into an hand brake spin, shots ring out. The windshield shatters and Wazim groans in pain.<br/><br/>Another shot rings out, winging Charleston, who grunts and floors it.<br/><br/>"ABBA!" screams Noor, as she rushes to help the old warrior.<br/><br/>"No fear," says Charleston. "Remember all life is a lie."<br/><br/>"I know that, but Daddy!"<br/><br/>"Relax! I can bring you all back now!"<br/><br/>They drive away in a cloud of dust. Soon they are back at the hotel in Luxor.<br/><br/>"I see you have had an accident," says the bellhop.<br/><br/>"We had a bit of weather," says Charleston. "Lead rain."<br/><br/>"It is an all too common occurrence around here." He glances at Wazim. "Oh. A Bedouin got shot."<br/><br/>Freddie hands him some Egyptian pounds. "Perhaps you can say that in a different tone of voice."<br/><br/>"Oh! A Bedouin got shot!"<br/><br/>"May I remind you that he is my servant."<br/><br/>"I will get a doctor."<br/><br/>Ensconced in a hotel room, being attended by a doctor, Charleston commends Wazim. "You did a great job, bullet sponge."<br/><br/>Wazim, who is in significant pain, mutters "Remind me to cut you when I feel better."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414819/#Comment_414819" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T07:34:02+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  7:34AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2013 11:00AM by Aviatrix.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Champagne and Battle Cries, Just in Time For Sunrise (Part 10)</b><br/><br/><i>29 March 1925</i><br/><br/>The next day, Freddie, Pearkes, Charleston and Noor motor out to the Clive Expedition dig. Officially the dig is excavating a large temple.<br/><br/><i>[Indeed, it's the Temple of Hatshepshut, the female Pharaoh, which was slowly uncovered throughout the 1920s and 1930s. I liked this better than the Dhashur site, and have moved the encounter with the Big N to another area.]</i><br/><br/>Surprisingly, the dig area is fenced in, and there are armed guards at the gate. Freddie tries to talk his way past.<br/><br/>"Sorry, but there is no admittance."<br/><br/>Pearkes narrows his eyes. By their accent, he knows them to be Boers, probably from the Rhodesian colony.<br/><br/>"I understand perfectly. Could you do me a favor and deliver my card to Dr. Clive? He did say that we could call on him at any time and I just want him to know we're in the area."<br/><br/>They motor away from the dig and tour the area, trying to see if there's another way in. There are other active excavations in the region, run by different expeditions; as they pass one such site, an older gentleman steps out of a tent, notices them, and waves.<br/><br/>Charleston stops the car. "Hello," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Howdy," drawls the man. "Can I help you?"<br/><br/>"You're an American!" says Freddie with delight.<br/><br/>"Yup. Dr. Abner Ravenwood. I was just going to have some coffee; why don't you come and sit a spell?"<br/><br/>"Thank you very much!"<br/><br/>They disembark and enter Dr. Ravenwood's tent. "Marion!" cries the old archaeologist. A woman in her late teens with dark hair enters, carrying a coffee service. "This is my daughter, Marion. I'd introduce you to my post-doc, Henry, but he's out in the field."<br/><br/>"Ah, Henry Ravenwood?"<br/><br/>"No, Henry Jones. Although I think maybe one day soon Marion's going to be changing her name to Jones--"<br/><br/>"Dad!"<br/><br/>"I'm just saying, you and Hank do get along..."<br/><br/>"You know he doesn't like to be called--"<br/><br/>"I say, not Henry Jones, Jr.?" interjects Freddie. "I believe I've heard of his father."<br/><br/>"Dr. Jones? Yes, Henry's a good friend, I work with him back in Indiana. Good Grail scholar."<br/><br/>"Well, we must all have a fixation. Personally, I think the Grail is lost forever, although the Germans seem to think they can find it."<br/><br/>"Ah, that's Wagnerian nonsense. The state of German archaeology has fallen off since Schliemann."<br/><br/><i>[FP sussed out who these folks are--Dr. Abner Ravenwood, his daughter Marion Ravenwood, and of course Dr. Henry Jones, Jr., better known as "Indiana." Pulp Fiction, baby!]</i><br/><br/>They talk on for a bit. Dr. Ravenwood explains that the Clives have been much more security conscious since the disappearance of the sarcophagus. Ravnewood knew the Carlyle expedition, although he has a low opinion of "that peckerwood" Roger Carlyle; he thought much better of Sir Aubrey, whom he describes as quite an excellent amateur Egyptologist. He also mentions that the Penhew Foundation finances quite a few digs all around the world, although they concentrate on "flashy stuff."<br/><br/>"Bernie--I can call you Bernie, yes?"<br/><br/>"Sure. Can I call you Freddie?"<br/><br/>"Of course! Everyone calls me Freddie."<br/><br/>"Yes sir, Mr. Blakely. We all do," mutters Charleston.<br/><br/>"Do you think you could get me up to see Clive?"<br/><br/>"I suppose so, as a professional courtesy. Ah, here's Henry! He can take you up."<br/><br/>"Ah, Dr. Jones, I presume!"<br/><br/>A rather dashing man enters the tent, an old gas mask bag slung over one shoulder. "Who wants to know?"<br/><br/>Abner introduces them all around, and soon Dr. Jones is leading them up to a side entrance. "I think I know your father," says Freddie brightly.<br/><br/>"Too bad for you. Dad and I don't get on."<br/><br/><i>[I just want to interject that I thought I did a decent Harrison Ford impression here.]</i><br/><br/>"Well, Indiana--can I call you Indiana?"<br/><br/>"Only my friends do. How did you know that, by the way?"<br/><br/>"Dr. Ravenwood said you were from there."<br/><br/>"No, Abner's from there. I just like the name. I guess I'll call you England, then."<br/><br/>They approach a side gate to the Clive dig site. A nervous looking man is standing there, chain-smoking. This turns out to be Dr. James Gardner, who explains that he's a Paleopsychologist, interested in the psyches of past civilizations. Freddie chats him up, and gradually Gardner begins to talk about recent events at the dig. <br/><br/><i>[Reassurance buy from Freddie.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes notices that he is armed, although he doesn't strike the Colonel as somebody who knows his way around guns.<br/><br/>According to Gardner, the sarcophagus they found was positively identified as Nitocris, a fact that Clive immediately concealed. He also says that he thinks it was removed via a secret passage to a space under the Pyramids. "In fact, I think there's a whole hidden city--"<br/><br/>He abruptly breaks off as an athletic-looking blonde man comes striding down the slope to the gate. "Good afternoon, gentlemen," he says, betraying a German accent.<br/><br/>"Dr. Johannes Sprech, I presume?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Indeed. Mr. Blakely?"<br/><br/>"The same. We were just chatting with James here and wondering if we might drop in on old Clivesy. I hear you're doing simply fantastic work out here."<br/><br/>"Well," says Sprech, obviously flattered, "it is fascinating what we are finding. I can't see any harm in bringing you up to the camp."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery buy by FP. He also did a quick CR buy to have some info on Agnes Broadmoor and Martin Winfield.]</i><br/><br/>As they climb the hill, Sprech describes his work. "I've always had a facility with codes and ciphers. Since I was a young boy, I have been able to read hieroglyphics on sight. This stood me in good stead during the war, where I had the honor to serve against men such as the Colonel."<br/><br/>"You fought well," says Pearkes, grudgingly.<br/><br/>"As did you. The Canadian infantry set a standard for excellence. I enjoyed listening to your coded transmissions on several occasions."<br/><br/>They come up to the main campsite, which consists of several semi-permanent tents rigged up on platform as well as some shacks for storage. As they enter Clive's headquarters, he and Winfield are poring over a map, which Clive quickly folds up.<br/><br/>"Why, Freddie, old man! What a surprise to see you down here."<br/><br/>"Just in the area, old sport, thought I'd drop in to take a look."<br/><br/>"Of course, of course! You're always welcome. Martin, why don't you show our friends around?"<br/><br/>Just then an elderly woman in a loose caftan, with a scarf tied around her head enters the tent. She goes up to Winfield. "I had a vision about you, Martin. You were alone, all alone in the darkness!" She suddenly seems to become aware of the strangers in the tent. "Why, Freddie Blakely! It's been a month of Sundays!"<br/><br/><i>[FP's spend pays off here; Agnes was a minor sensation during the War, when quite a few spiritualists were in vogue.]</i><br/><br/>"I'm surprised you remember me, Mrs. Broadmoor. Was it Elizabeths' where we met?"<br/><br/>"I believe so. How delightful to see you again. You must let me do a reading for you."<br/><br/>"Smashing! We're just in town, pop around tonight."<br/><br/>They spend the rest of the afternoon being guided around the dig carefully by Winfield. Charleston takes several pictures under the ruse of being portraits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414829/#Comment_414829" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T09:52:50+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  9:52AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>"ABBA!" screams Noor, as she rushes to help the old warrior.<br/><br/>"No fear," says Charleston.

(He's also brilliant in real life, a history and linguistics geek and I almost always learn something talking to him.)<br/><br/>His "Freddie" accent is perfect, BTW; I promise I'll try to get a clip of it up.<br/><br/>I should note that these write-ups do seem to have Freddie in most of the important conversations. This is a bit of an illusion--CP in particular is also quite vocal (I didn't include his whispered conversation with Noor wherein he proposed sacrificing Marion for a ritual, a suggestion Noor reluctantly turned down)--but FP is the party face and so does the lion's share of interaction.

"My dear Mr. Blakely," she says, taking Freddie's hand. "I was to give you this." She hands Freddie a note. "Do not read this unless you are alone," it begins:\n<blockquote>Your lives are in danger. Something terrible is going to happen at Giza. The Sphinx knows.<br/><br/>Meet me at midnight, in the dry wash north of the dig.<br/><br/>--Gardner</blockquote>\nFreddie whispers the contents of the note to the others as they settle down into the seance. "Is there anyone you wish to speak to in particular?" asks Agnes.<br/><br/>"Roger Carlyle?"<br/><br/>"I call upon thee, Horus, Anubis, gods of the dead..."<br/><br/>Her incantation goes on for a while, but then she falters. "I cannot seem to reach him."<br/><br/><i>[Dum-duh-DUM! Foreshadowing!]</i><br/><br/>"Is there anyone else?" asks Agnes. "I sense a great sadness in you."<br/><br/>"Well...Miss Jackson Elias. Er, Elisa Olney."<br/><br/>Agnes begins the incantation again, but this time something changes--about halfway through, she stops, and her eyes roll back into her head.<br/><br/>"Do not ask me to do such trivial things," she intones. "I am the Gateway. Ask me your questions."<br/><br/>Charleston watches uncomfortably, recognizing this an actual supernatural event.<br/><br/>"They are going to raise the Great Evil," continues Broadmoor in a strange, hollow voice.<br/><br/>"All right, what can we do to prevent it?"<br/><br/>"The Girdle. The Girdle of Nitocris. It is at the Mosque of Ibn Tulun. They search for it. Broadmoor and Gardner will be killed."<br/><br/>"She speaks to the Al-Mithal," mutters Wazim. "To the spirit world..."<br/><br/>"Do you know that mosque?"<br/><br/>"Yes, it is in Cairo."<br/><br/>"Damn. Seems a bad idea to go there. Agnes, one last thing: what is it about these serpents who breathe fire? The ones that attacked Nyiti?"<br/><br/>"They do not breathe fire. Shakhti summoned the fire to attack them."<br/><br/>"Interesting. Oh, and who is it who possessed our Mrs. Broadmoor?"<br/><br/>"I AM Agnes Broadmoor," the voice says. Shortly thereafter she snaps out of it.<br/><br/>"I say, Agnes, it seems the people you are working for are planning to do you in."<br/><br/>"Oh dear!" <br/><br/>"I think you should stay with us. Gents, we need to get out of here."<br/><br/>"We can ride," chime in Pearkes and Wazim.<br/><br/>"Right, let's get ready..."<br/><br/>"Gentlemen," says Pearkes. "We have a duty to Dr. Gardner."<br/><br/><i>[At this point an incredibly long planning session ensued, with the players actually making things seem much harder. FP assumed that it would be impossible for Gardner to evade Winfield and Sprech. This wasn't completely accurate--he had a plan--but FP managed to argue his point.<br/><br/>CP was absolutely against the rescue--"This is the sort of thing that ends up with people mowing down other people," he said, mostly in character.<br/><br/>PP just wanted to ride in, which I supported with the help of Wazim. (When CP objected that he wanted a motorcycle because he couldn't ride, Wazim merely said "It is not your fault you are not a man.")<br/><br/>I probably should have intervened, but I didn't want to make it look like I was short-circuiting the PCs. OTOH, I could have perhaps interjected that Pearkes didn't think much of the camp's overall security. (CP also kept insisting that they make some kind of plan, although I pointed out that Pearkes was a cavalry officer--"Having no plan IS the plan!")<br/><br/>I think next time I'll intervene--a gentle "this is an action movie scene" might have done the trick.]</i><br/><br/>It takes a while but slowly a plan emerges--Pearkes will ride down to grab Gardner, while Freddie and the Bedouin will lie in wait to ambush anyone following Gardner. Meanwhile, Charleston will ride a motorcycle around the camp, armed with dynamite bombs. The motorcycle is quickly provided by Qusay, following a healthy infusion of cash from Freddie. Charleston, remembering the rumbles he encountered in Chinatown, shakes his head over the recklessness of the plan, but reluctantly comes along.<br/><br/>As they approach the camp, they see that one of the tents is on fire. Men rush around inside it, trying to put out the blaze. Seizing their chance, the group sprint for the dry wash Gardner told them about. Soon they see him, running with his pistol out, bleeding from one leg.<br/><br/>Pearkes rears his horse and plunges down the canyon slope in the starlight. Riding at a level gallop, he grabs Gardner and slings him onto the back of his horse.<br/><br/>"Hurry," gasps the archaeologist. "They're after us."<br/><br/>Moments later, Sprech and Winfield, on horseback, rush into the canyon. Charleston lights a bomb with the cigar he keeps clenched in his mouth and lets fly. There is a loud report, and the horses throw their riders to the sand. They stagger around clutching their ears. Charleston guns his engine and soon meets up with Pearkes and the rest of the rescue party.<br/><br/>Gardner climbs into the sidecar of Charleston's motorcycle. "I hope you don't smoke," says Chiu.<br/><br/>"Hunh? No, I don't," says Gardner, already reaching for his pack.<br/><br/>Charleston gestures down at Gardner's feet, where several dynamite bombs lie, fuses ready to be lit. The doctor turns pale.<br/><br/>Grinning, Charleston taps the ash of his cigar to the sand and drives off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They are less than an hour from the landing on the river where a rented boat waits for them when a dark shape slides across the stars. A thin wailing seems to come from the sky.<br/><br/>"Hey Gardner, check out what's making that noise," says Charleston.<br/><br/>Gardner looks back and begins to scream.<br/><br/>"Oh, it's you," says Charleston.<br/><br/>"Incoming," screams Pearkes, sliding his horse around.<br/><br/>A great winged serpent rushes from the air and races past Wazim. Its tail flicks out and wraps around his neck, hoisting him up in the air.<br/><br/>Charleston halts the motorcycle and digs out the <i>Al-Azif</i>. Frantically flipping through the pages, he finds an incantation and begins to chant.<br/><br/>The serpent regards him with baleful eyes.<br/><br/>Then it blinks.<br/><br/>Then it bows.<br/><br/><i>[OK. This is probably not legal. There's some question as to how you could try to bind a bound Hunting Horror--I have no idea if that's even possible. On the other hand, the Al-Azif has some oomph to it.<br/><br/>Truth be told, I hadn't run a contest before (I do one later in the session much better), and I'm still picking up the magic rules. So I kind of blew it. However, the thing to do when you mess up, is to make it a plot point--Charleston succeeded here, so </i>somebody<i> or </i>something<i> helped him. Who? and Why? Play to find out!<br/><br/>In the future, I think I can grant a pool of magic points granted by the Al-Azif.]</i><br/><br/>"Put him down," orders Charleston. He turns to the others. "So, you want to ride back into town in style?"<br/><br/>"You will all die," says the serpent. At least, that's what Charleston hears; the others hear only a guttural muttering.<br/><br/><i>[Either the spell granted Charleston the ability to understand Aklo, or he's picking it up unconsciously.]</i><br/><br/>"Who sent you?" asks Charleston.<br/><br/>"Humans all look alike to me. His title in Aklo is Archaeologist. He had a mustache."<br/><br/>"Clive," mutters Charleston. "What were you sent to do?"<br/><br/>"Kill you all. It's generally what I do. The Dark Lord will feast upon your souls."<br/><br/>"I wouldn't know what that feels like."<br/><br/>"They say its a peaceful feeling, like an enema."<br/><br/>"Are you from the Outer Realms?"<br/><br/>"Do I look like a local?"<br/><br/>"Say, do you guys explode? Because I saw one like you once who we think exploded..."<br/><br/>"We don't explode."<br/><br/>"All right. Go eat Clive, then go to Hell or whatever. Just don't come back to me."<br/><br/>"I make no promises." The serpent vanishes.<br/><br/>As they finally crest a ridge and come sight the Nile, the wind carries the faint sound of explosions from the Clive camp. They ride down to the river, where the flickering lights of a steamer wait for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414881/#Comment_414881" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T21:49:03+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  9:49PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it'd be legit in Call of Cthulhu to have a POW vs POW if two dueling sorcerers tried to command a creature, bound or not.

The dark waters of the Nile flow past the boat.<br/><br/>"Hey Noor, leave the desert, come with us. You know too much. We're going to continue to search for more interesting things. I need a partner, I need somebody I can trust..."<br/><br/>"I don't like the desert!"<br/><br/>He tells the story of the encounter in the desert with the winged serpent. Noor is impressed. "You spoke Aklo? But how is it you bound this thing?"<br/><br/>"I don't know, but it obeyed my commands!"<br/><br/><i>1 April 1925</i><br/><br/>Early in the morning of April 1st they tie up just south of Cairo. Freddie makes some discreet arrangements and soon they are ready to rent a villa to stash Broadmoor and Gardner. As a precaution, they put it in Wazim's name.<br/><br/>"What? I live in a tent."<br/><br/>"Well, now you'll own a villa."<br/><br/>Grumpy at having been corrupted by the Europeans, Wazim stomps off to rest from his recent wounds.<br/><br/><i>[This is rather typical of FP's play style--misdirection and avoidance of confrontation are his hallmark. He was already planning to leave Egypt right after they returned from the Clive dig; only Gardner's note, and Pearkes' insistence that they help him, kept them from running.<br/><br/>Normally I'm happy to reward his cleverness, but it's less optimal for Masks, although I think quite a bit of my reaction is because I have Cool Stuff I want them to see. But on the other hand, if they want a pulp adventure, then they have to respect the conventions and confront evil. Freddie's Drive is Bad Luck, which is not so useful for me; I lack the direct handle other Drives give me.<br/><br/>OTOH, Bad Luck is the perfect excuse for his plans going awry, as they do in this case. Plus, I don't think FP has quite grasped the Rules of Engagement; it's very difficult, at this point, for them to escape observation by the Cult, even without resorting to supernatural means.]</i><br/><br/>The civil unrest in Cairo has burnt down to a simmering resentment by this point--mostly through the crushing application of martial law. The major European powers have cordoned off their section of town and actively patrol it.<br/><br/><i>[Not really historical, but I liked having a Boxer rebellion feel.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie arranges a meeting with Saad Zaghloul. The would-be Prime Minister is busy but takes time to speak to one of his biggest backers.<br/><br/><i>[Credit Rating spend by Freddie.]</i><br/><br/>"Saad, old man, I'd like to give you a large donation of British Railway stock. Please feel free to use it to found a fraternal order of your co-religionists."<br/><br/>"A Brotherhood...of Muslims?"<br/><br/>"Good name. In return, I'd like an introduction to the Mosque of Ibn Tulun."<br/><br/>"Oh, the madhouse? I see...you meddle with powerful forces, my friend. But take this to them, they will admit you to those you seek."<br/><br/><i>[So in Alt-Earth, Freddie Blakely founded the Muslim Brotherhood. And the short-lived Paris Soviet! I think at some point the Foreign Minister might take note...]</i><br/><br/>The Mosque is nearly a thousand years old, its magnificence having faded with the centuries; currently it is being used as an insane asylum. The faint screams of the patients mix with the distant cries of mullahs as they arrive. A young talib takes the note from Saad and then leads them deep beneath the earth.<br/><br/>They are introduced to an ancient man named Achmed Zehavi. "What can I do for you gentlemen?"<br/><br/>"We are looking for a belt."<br/><br/>"There is no belt."<br/><br/>"A <i>girdle</i>," clarifies Charleston.<br/><br/>"One that will prevent a great evil from returning," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"I will show you, the Girdle is in no danger," says Zehavi.<br/><br/>He leads them to another chamber, one locked behind a heavy iron door. Inside, a strange belt of linked gold chains sits on a pedestal under a crystal cover. The clasp is a single uncut ruby, which seems to pulse and change color as they stare at it.<br/><br/>Surrounding the Girdle are six ancient men, armed with enormous scimitars. One of the men steps over to meet him. His sword is made of a peculiar gray metal; it is one of those blades that appear so sharp that you fear you will cut your eyes looking at it.<br/><br/>"I am the Nessim."<br/><br/>"Nice swords," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"This one is particularly special. It is the Sword of Akmallah. It will cut any creature, be they from Heaven or be they from Hell."<br/><br/>"Ah, like those Irish swords that strike you dead with a single touch," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"No, no, you have to cut them more than once. But it will cut them."<br/><br/>The Nessim explains that in order to raise the evil queen, the cult must have the Girdle, Crown, and Necklace; because of this, they have been commanded by Allah to protect the Girdle with the Sword of Akmallah. And as they can see, it is quite safe.<br/><br/>Of course, Freddie and company disagree--they point out that Cult knows where it is, and that Shakhti can summon a jinn quite capable of tunneling through the earth to the Girdle. Freddie suggest various schemes; he asks if it is possible to modify the Girdle, so that it may be hidden in plain sight.<br/><br/>"The Girdle does not allow itself to be altered," says Achmed.<br/><br/>This throws everyone for a bit of a loop, but Freddie then proposes to copy the Girdle. The Nessim shakes his head. "It would be trivial for the Powers of Darkness to perceive the true Girdle," he says.<br/><br/><i>[FP, in his usual rerouting mode; but as this is a Mythos artifact of significant power with a major plot token value, I felt justified in shooting these ideas down. In any case, they would undoubtedly have been tried in the four thousand years the Ulama have been guarding the Girdle.]</i><br/><br/>"What should we do, English? Allah tells me to guard the Girdle. What does Allah tell you?"<br/><br/>"Unfortunately, Allah doesn't talk to me."<br/><br/>"We share a covenant," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"Ah, yes, the Christian god. We understand how that works with you. As People of the Book, it is forbidden to war with you; but you do not subscribe to a similar belief."<br/><br/>"Technically," says Freddie, "we all share a god. Unless you're a Buddhist or something, Charleston."<br/><br/>"Oh, I follow a <i>different</i> faith," says Charleston.<br/><br/>Freddie finally prevails upon them to speak with Saad and move the Girdle around from place to place, so as to hide it from the Cult.<br/><br/><i>[FP with a Reassurance buy, I think.<br/><br/>FP: I like how I keep coming up with mundane solutions for paranormal problems.<br/>Me: Yes, but those don't always work...]</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414954/#Comment_414954" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T21:05:59+00:00" title="May 29, 2013  9:05PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Champagne and Battle Cries, Just in Time For Sunrise (Part 13)</b><br/><br/>Not content with just moving the Girdle, Charleston begins to research a way to destroy it.

As Freddie turns to go, he says: "It's very easy."<br/><br/>"What, old man?"<br/><br/>"Destroying the girdle. We just need a dagger. A magical dagger."<br/><br/>"Well, we happen to have one, don't you know!"<br/><br/>"No, not that one. We must make it. Of a single element. The same kind of dagger as can be used to summon a creature of the outer world."<br/><br/>"Oh....is that all..."<br/><br/>"Yes. I can cast the spell. I will, later."<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos spend by Charleston; no major revelations, so just a 2-point Stability loss. They looked at what kind of metal to use; CP pointed out that Aluminum is Atomic Number 13, so they were interested in that--albeit, Aluminum is very reactive, so that's hard to do.]</i><br/><br/>"Great, old sport, I'll work on getting us the dagger."<br/><br/>"One other thing. We have to kill a human being with the dagger. I'll let you work that out too."<br/><br/>"I...see. I say old man, is there any way we could just hide the Girdle? Conceal it from the Powers and that sort of thing?"<br/><br/>"I will see if I can find out. Come back later."<br/><br/><i>[Not verbatim conversation, but in the spirit of CPs description. This spend was a bit troubling to me. It seemed clear to me that this question could reveal that Nyarlathotep is planning to essentially wreck the planet, and that everything Charleston believes to be true is only the tiniest piece of the real world. As one of Charleston's Pillars is "Belief in Science," this could be a Pillar-shattering moment that would cause his Sanity to circle the drain.<br/><br/>I dithered for a while, but decided it was too early to blast him out of the water, so charged 4 Stability and 1 Sanity. In any case, as far as Charleston is concerned, this </i>is<i> science.]</i><br/><br/>Later, Freddie drops in again. Charleston is sitting facing the wall, gently smiling.<br/><br/>"Any luck, old man?"<br/><br/>"The great god Nyarlat-hotep is behind it all. He sees All, knows All. You cannot hide the Girdle from him, if he so wishes. Eventually he will devour our souls. What is for dinner?"<br/><br/>"Uh...Beef Wellington, I think."<br/><br/>"Excellent."<br/><br/><i>2 April 1925</i><br/><br/>The next day, Freddie, Charleston and Pearkes head out to get a dagger made. Freddie finds a silversmith.<br/><br/>"What you ask, it makes no sense. It will tarnish if I make it of pure silver, and cannot hold an edge."<br/><br/>"It won't need an edge," says Charleston. "The knife is not what cuts."<br/><br/>"Look, old man, it's crucial we get this. Can you do it?"<br/><br/>"Come back in a week."<br/><br/>"Let me emphasize how urgent it is," says Freddie, handing over a bushel of Egyptian pounds.<br/><br/>"Come back tomorrow."<br/><br/>To throw off the scent, Freddie stops in different stores, ordering forks and other utensils of silver, Egyptian pottery plates and crocks, and other dinner service items. Finally, he stops at a clothmakers and orders a banner with the sigil of Shakhti Bey's family.<br/><br/>"I will not make such a thing," says the shopkeeper. "And I will not do business with one who asks."<br/><br/>Soon Freddie discovers that nobody in the bazaar will sell him anything anymore. He heads back to the hotel. Soon they realize they are being followed by people wearing the Cult emblem.<br/><br/>Freddie passes out some coins to the local urchins. "Throw these at the feet of these men following us. Do this until you run out or they stop following us."<br/><br/>Sure enough, scattering money at the feet of ruffians causes some to stop, and others to be mobbed by beggars. Whistling nonchalantly, Freddie and company head back to the hotel. Along the way, however, Freddie notices that several small children have begun to follow them.<br/><br/>Somewhat disturbed by this sign of a powers battle, he arrives at Shepheard's.<br/><br/>"Ah, Mr. Blakely. We missed you. Of course, we kept your rooms and billed you for them."<br/><br/>"Very well!"<br/><br/>As he walks into the bar, Freddie finds Shakhti standing there.<br/><br/>"Shakhti Bey!"<br/><br/>"Mr. Blakely. Shall we step outside?"<br/><br/>As they reach the terrace, Freddie says, "So Shakhti Bey, did you know that Dr. Clive is in the most interesting sort of business."<br/><br/>"Really? I am not surprised. He sends his regards, by the way."<br/><br/>"Oh, so he does work for you."<br/><br/>"Not at all, I merely help coordinate things for him. He wired me from the dig yesterday."<br/><br/><i>[Oddly enough, FP thought they weren't working together and was planning his usual tactic of setting his enemies upon each other.]</i><br/><br/>"Too bad. I was rather hoping he'd develop a headache."<br/><br/>"No, he is quite good at keeping his head."<br/><br/>"As are others," says Pearkes, knowingly.<br/><br/>"And this must be Mr. Chiu," says Shakhti.<br/><br/>"Must it?"<br/><br/>"I am sorry you were indisposed when you visited us. It is a terribly feeling, not being disposed of."<br/><br/>"Shakhti old man, you wouldn't happen to know anything about a mummy of Nitocris that was discovered?"<br/><br/>"Nitocris is an ancient legend."<br/><br/>"Well, sir, you are an Egyptian historian."<br/><br/>"Or Egyptian history," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"Ah. If we are to drop pretense, I did not get along well with Nitocris. She was an alien and not even Egyptian. Of course, neither am I, but I have lived here for millennia."<br/><br/>"Well...I suppose my only question is, why? How do you keep interest?"<br/><br/>"I have a role to play."<br/><br/>"Well, I'm barely thirty and I'm usually bored to death."<br/><br/>"That is because you do not perceive, sir. I see a larger world than you."<br/><br/>"Well, why come to us?"<br/><br/>"I just wanted you to know that you cannot possibly win."<br/><br/>"I assure you, I really do not know what is going on."<br/><br/>"I begin to suspect that, yes. However, I will give you this last chance. Leave Egypt."<br/><br/>"We were planning to do so. Could you do me the smallest favor?"<br/><br/>"Probably not."<br/><br/>"Could you give us safe passage to the Canal."<br/><br/>"Ah, do you bargain with your god, Mr. Blakely?"<br/><br/>"All the time."<br/><br/>"That is why you fail. Oh, Mr. Chiu, aluminum is very clever. Too bad about the silversmith. His wife will mourn him."<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414956/#Comment_414956" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T21:09:29+00:00" title="May 29, 2013  9:09PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Champagne and Battle Cries, Just in Time for Sunrise (Part 14)</b><br/><br/>"So much for the dagger," says Charleston after Shakhti leaves.<br/><br/>"Wait a moment," says Freddie. "Audrey?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Mr. Blakely?" says Sheila.<br/><br/>"Did we bring that silver? The wedding set I had made up for when I was going to marry Miss Elias? The one that was pure silver?"<br/><br/>Put out, Sheila leaves and returns with a battered box. "Here you are, sir," she says coldly.<br/><br/><i>[Massive Preparedness buy here by FP.]</i><br/><br/>"This work for you, Chuckles?"<br/><br/>Charleston examines the knife, and finding it workable, he leaves to go begin the spell.<br/><br/>"Now for the murder," mutters Freddie. "Perhaps one of the guardians will agree to make this sacrifice." He arranges with Saad to set up a meet, and is told to go to one of the markets later that day.<br/><br/>In the afternoon, Freddie and Pearkes make their way to the tent they were told to go to. Inside, they find one of the Ulama, lying on the floor, a horrible head wound providing clear cause of death.<br/><br/>A crowd gathers outside.<br/><br/>"You should call the religious authorities. An Ulama has been killed," says Freddie in Arabic.<br/><br/>"Shakhti...Shakhti..." chants the crowd.<br/><br/>"Hetep!" says Pearkes imperiously.<br/><br/>"That's the apostate we were supposed to kill first!" says someone in the crowd. They produce spiked clubs and advance. Pearkes and Freddie take off.<br/><br/>As Freddie sprints down the alley, Pearkes on his heels, the crowd momentarily is blocked by the narrow space. Pearkes takes advantage of this to roll a grenade he keeps in his satchel at them.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness by PP.]</i><br/><br/>Several fall down, but others swarm over them. Pearkes runs out into the marketplace. Freddie has already run far ahead, another band of cultists hot on his trail. As they run, the cultists shout, "Kill him! He raped a girl! Death to the white devil!"<br/><br/>Freddie yells back at them, in Egyptian Arabic, "They work for the King! They betray you all!"<br/><br/>Bemused, the onlookers decide not to help either group.<br/><br/>Pearkes sprints down another alley. He flips a grenade into a flour basket as he tears by. A tremendous explosion knocks him down. Pearkes gets up, dusts himself off, and makes a final sprint and running leap onto a tram that is just leaving its stop. He waves regally at his frustrated pursuers.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Freddie dashes down another alley. At one end is a large awning, spread out to block the alleyway. As he burst through it, he discovers that the reason it was rigged like that is to prevent people from running into several large water jugs. With a drunkard's grace honed by years of running from the bobbies, Freddie slides through, tripping on them and knocking them over. He slips, lands on his feet, and keeps running as the cultists slip and flounder through the wet pavement.<br/><br/><i>[I'm using the "narrate cool stuff for a point refresh" rule from Night's Black Agents; FP narrated this bit, and it was great.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie dashes up to several French Gendarmes guarding the European quarter. "Never been so glad to see a gendarme in my life," he says jauntily, sauntering past them.<br/><br/>*  *  *<br/><br/>Meanwhile, down at a villa on the Nile, James Gardner is working in his upstairs bedroom, resting his wounded leg.<br/><br/>Downstairs, Agnes Broadmoor is laying out Tarot cards. She crosses the Hanged Man with the Tower.<br/><br/>"Oh dear," she says. A shadow falls over the table.<br/><br/>"Hello, Agnes old girl," says Clive.<br/><br/>Upstairs, Gardner hears the smack of leather on leather. "Took you long enough," he says resignedly, as Winfield steps into the room, slapping his gauntlets together.<br/><br/>*  *  *<br/><br/>"Note for you," says the bartender.<br/><br/>"Thanks a bunch for taking care of our friends! Very best, Henry Clive" the note reads.<br/><br/>"Damn," says Freddie.<br/><br/>Charleston finishes the dagger and begins to clean his Tommy gun. He and Noor discuss their plans, and what spells may help them.<br/><br/>In his room, Pearkes lies next to his elkhound, MacDonald. He looks at his VC. He'll never get a citation for it, but he thinks attacking the Sphinx will earn him a bar for his medal.<br/><br/>Freddie sits at the bar, remembering the night Jackson told him she was going to the front.<br/><br/>"You can't be serious."<br/><br/>"I am. I want to find out what is going on up there, to find out who I am and what kind of a writer I can be."<br/><br/>"It's insane!"<br/><br/>"It's my duty. Don't you believe in anything larger than yourself?"<br/><br/>Freddie lit a cigarette, then stubbed it out in anger.<br/><br/>"One other thing," said Jackson. "It will be easier if I have a member of the gentry sign the order."<br/><br/>"I suppose that's me."<br/><br/>"Will you do it?"<br/><br/>Freddie grimaces, remembering that moment. He'd signed, of course. Damnit, maybe Jax was right. Maybe there were bigger things than yourself. He asks Sheila to join him for a bottle.<br/><br/>"I'm very fond of you, old girl," he says.<br/><br/><i>[Final refreshes before the end of the session, and all pretty darn good!]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414962/#Comment_414962" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T22:32:40+00:00" title="May 29, 2013 10:32PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as having a villa and a quick Get Out of Egypt go, I'm totally fine with FP doing that. There's plenty of stuff to see and do elsewhere, and Masks is one of those campaigns where a) you can go back to a place you've visited earlier and b) odds are good no party is going to be able to see everything.<br/><br/>This won't keep the cultists from being able to track them. In other words, it isn't a Get Out of Plot card. And Freddy's Bad Luck is very, very useful. You don't even need the PCs to make a mistake in trying to stay off the radar; you just need Freddy's Bad Luck. Sure, reward folks with a Stability refresh, maybe an ability refresh or three as well (as you're sweeping up the whole group in Freddy's Bad Luck) -- this won't hurt a thing and will let the group continue on, which is what you probably want.<br/><br/>Nitocris's Girdle is a tricky call. I like that FP's player is trying solutions that don't involve "and then the PCs loot the place, like they always do, because PCs know best, and everything can be done by PCs, and nothing can be done by NPCs". This is a combination of cleverness and lack of hubris, and one would like to reward it.<br/><br/>But, as you noted, one doesn't want cultists or protectors being idiots. All of these ideas would have been tried before. And, one also doesn't want the players going, "*Eyeroll* Sigh. No matter what we do, the bad guys will get the thing and resurrect the big bad."<br/><br/>It's a tricky call. I think what I might do is have the guardians try what Freddy suggested and have it work for a while -- and when it ceases working, then have the last survivor manage to send it off to the PCs. They're not forced into becoming thieves. The good guys aren't being morons. The best bet is to send it far away. Yes, this only buys time, but right now, that's what they need. And, this means you add more bad guys to follow the PCs around, since Freddy's Bad Luck will ensure that the Egyptian Cultists find out about this sooner than one might expect.<br/><br/>Hm... if there is still stuff in Egypt you want them to see, if the bad guys manage to capture the PCs (I don't know how likely this is -- if it's a thing you want, a) tell the players this is the inevitable "get captured and moved to lair so you can learn bad guy plot and be in position to thwart it" trope, b) give them a seriously good chance to have the PCs escape and do just that, and c) maybe bribe them -- in Fate, I hand out Fate Points for this. In Trail, maybe Refreshes will do the trick. But it's all in keeping with Pulp mode), they can ship them and the Girdle back to Egypt so that the PCs can thwart what needs a-thwarting (or not, depending on how things go) and see more of what you want them to see.<br/><br/>(Hm. If the PCs fail to thwart Nitocris's resurrection and you don't want to go all Purist, there might be something to be said in having her try to cut deals with them, but that's an odd path for a very, very different day.)<br/><br/>Mind, given that there are ways to destroy the thing, the guardians do have a certain lack of imagination or information, or both.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's easy to babble from the outside, where I'm not running it. I'm having a lot of fun hearing about how you're running it. (And tomorrow, I run a CoC adventure from Cubicle 7's Scotland book for my Kerberos Club Fate book -- one of my players explained how one does an instant death attack if one really wants one in Fate.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414963/#Comment_414963" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T22:33:21+00:00" title="May 29, 2013 10:33PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My last post was written just before part 13 went up.

Lisa :-) In any case, we're all caught up, just in time for Saturday's next session!<br/><br/>I do appreciate what you wrote. Generally, I reward FPs clever thinking; the history of my Pathfinder game was one of him maneuvering all the NPCs like pawns, and then setting them up for a horrific fall. When we played "Masks" together, he solved the JuJu house problem by having his character, a mob hitman, drop in on the cops and use his contacts with them to get them to raid the place. The Keeper rewarded his cleverness, as he should have. (I might have been a bit crueler and not handed over the Mask of Hyama etc., but I'm a bit more genre-aware.)<br/><br/>In this case, however, the solutions ran smack into the problem of dealing with the supernatural in any Cthulhu game--it's hard to do, unless you use the supernatural against it. There's essentially no way to conceal the Girdle that a clued in cultist (or ultimately Shakhti) can't see through. His plan of moving things around was the best option, and I didn't give them too hard a time on making the means to destroy it.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I do want the bang of having them at the resurrection scene. It's a great moment, and I have some major reboot stuff in it. (Plus it serves as the gateway to some of my own content, and I'd like them to get there.) I've basically got that scenario, but I'm going to give them a bone or two for being clever. I haven't said how many of the Ulama are dead, and the Sword of Akmallah is still out there--I plan to give them an opportunity to have it.<br/><br/>As for the snatch of Broadmoor and Gardner, well, if I want the rez scene, I need them in Shakhti's hands. Some good plot will come out of it (basically, the lead to the Sword), so it wasn't a complete failure. I mostly wanted to use it as another example of something I'd been trying to get over to them: things are different when viewpoint characters are involved. If one of the PCs had been at the villa, I would have given them a real chance to escape with B &amp; G, or even just whack the oppo. What I emphatically DON'T want them to do is to rely on offscreen help to handle their crises. This game must, in my opinion, be about sacrifice--about the price you're willing to pay to save the world--and that involves some real hard choices. <br/><br/>I'm of course not claiming this as original--it lies at the heart of all fiction, but especially American pulp fiction. Ken Hite very brilliantly caught this in his essay "The Man Who Shot Joseph Curwen", but you can see it any genre. What are the Chandler novels if not the tale of a man who gives up his own happiness and satisfaction in pursuit of truth and idealism? As cynical as Marlowe claims to be, he clearly sacrifices connection to get the truth. (It goes deeper, of course--part of his problem is his fear of the weakness that he finds in connection--but it's still mostly the story of the man who puts himself outside the normal world in order to win Truth.)<br/><br/>And from a practical viewpoint, it simulates the power of the Cult. They can be everywhere at once, and are more than capable of dealing with ordinary opponents.<br/><br/>I found what you wrote about Freddie's Luck to be really, really useful. The main issue I've had with Bad Luck as a drive is that I a) can't use it as a handle and b) it doesn't give the player a lot of choice. I basically have to hose Freddie from time to time, and that feels like it is just going to frustrate a player like FP, who needs to feel like his plans work.<br/><br/>What I'm thinking of doing is to use Bad Luck more like a standard Drive. So what I might do is offer a bit of a *World kind of option for Freddie. When I think one of his ideas is a significant plot point, I'll offer him a choice, something like:<br/><br/>--The plan fails (minor Stability refresh)<br/>--The plan partially succeeds (Stability LOSS)<br/>--The plan succeeds, but there are major consequences (minor stability loss or even a stability refresh)<br/><br/>...and then use some moves. (Maybe, 1 move and 1-point of Stability refresh? 2 Moves and 2 points? Or 2 point loss and one move, or 4 point loss and no move?) <br/><br/>I'll have to see how it plays out, but I think it will work--will preserve some player autonomy without allowing FP to simply outflank everything. And it will reward creativity. I hope.<br/><br/>Thanks much for the commentary, Lisa. I'll have to really think hard about it. I'm finding fighting my own storyTELLER feelings to be one of the harder parts of GMing this...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415255/#Comment_415255" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-01T20:35:20+00:00" title="June  1, 2013  8:35PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that was interesting, and I have nine hours of recording to sort through.

Not very nice people at all."<br/><br/>"I think I know who to ask about this," says Freddie. He heads upstairs to Dr. Mwimbe's room. "Wife? Are you in?"<br/><br/>There is a crash, and then Mwimbe cracks the door. "We are not married yet."<br/><br/>"Well, just trying to keep up appearances."<br/><br/>"I <i>am</i> keeping up appearances, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/><i>[FP wondered about using Dr. M as a Source here. I had to remind him that since nobody wanted to use the old system (ahem), I had streamlined it.]</i><br/><br/>"What do you know about Shakhti Bey's wives?"<br/><br/>"Can we talk somewhere else?"<br/><br/>"Of course! We are married."<br/><br/>In Freddie's room, Mwimbe addresses Freddie and company. "They are not just his wives. They are also his children, if you understand."<br/><br/>"Ah, they are bloodsucking vampires like him."<br/><br/>"He is not a bloodsucker, although they are. Shakhti promotes women who interest him to wife, and gives them great power."<br/><br/>"Mwimbe, Shakhti didn't promote you, did he?"<br/><br/>"No. They did not try to marry me."<br/><br/>"Ah, they tried to eat you."<br/><br/>"It was...a dark time."<br/><br/>"That's very mysterious."<br/><br/>"<i>I'm</i> very mysterious, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/><i>[Verbatim exchange.]</i><br/><br/>"I'd thought you academic types would be more freely disseminating of information."<br/><br/>"Have you read your Wittgenstein, Mr. Blakely? 'That which we cannot speak of we must pass over in silence.'"<br/><br/><i>[There followed, IRL, a ten minute discussion of Wittgenstein (FP finds him derivative), Russell (FP doesn't have a high opinion) Rousseau (anybody surprised PP isn't a fan?) and my own defense of the French Revolution. Immersion be damned.]</i><br/><br/>The group prepares to make their assault on the Mosque. Theorizing that wolfsbane may serve as an anti-vampiric agent, Freddie drops in on a German pharmacy. They're all out.<br/><br/><i>[FP failed the roll, but I thought I might throw in some consequences.]</i><br/><br/>Informed by Gilbert that they're trying to kill vampires, the pharmacist calmly points out that a stake of ash is more traditional and sends them to his brother's wife's cousin, who owns a high-end carpentry store. There they acquire some ash stakes. Meanwhile Freddie picks up a "souvenir" scimitar and a sawed-off shotgun from Anton's more disreputable friends.<br/><br/>They arrive at the mosque at sundown. It is a Thursday, so except for the call to prayer, many of the stores are shut for the weekend. The many pillars of the mosque cast blue-black shadows in the red rays of the setting sun.<br/><br/><i>[FP: Perfect time to go vampire hunting!<br/>Me: Yes, strange how that worked out.]</i><br/><br/>A young Taleb meets them at the entrance to the sanctuary. The dim sounds of inmates screaming mix with the calls of the muezzins.<br/><br/>"What ho, young student."<br/><br/>Without looking up from his Qaran, the student says with a resigned air, "Visiting hours end at sundown."<br/><br/>"Well, it's not sundown yet."<br/><br/>"Ah, you speak the language of the Prophet."<br/><br/>"We're here to learn about your religion. I'm tired of being an apostate."<br/><br/>"Come by tomorrow for lessons."<br/><br/>"Was hoping to pray tonight."<br/><br/>He heaves a sigh. "Very well."<br/><br/>As they enter the sanctuary, Freddie asks about the Nessim.<br/><br/>"I do not know what you mean."<br/><br/>"Well, we think the wives of a certain gentleman are after him."<br/><br/>"Women are not allowed."<br/><br/>"They don't tend to ask for permission."<br/><br/>"You speak in riddles. Can you not speak plainly?"<br/><br/>"Yes. They're vampires, and the wives of Shakhti Bey."<br/><br/>"Shakhti Bey is a powerful man and a bad Muslim, but vampires do not exist."<br/><br/>"Well, they certainly think they do!"<br/><br/>"I must return to my studies."<br/><br/>"I'll come with you!"<br/><br/>Pearkes heads upstairs into the asylum area. Carefully searching, he finds a blood trail and marks it. He turns to head back to the sanctuary.<br/><br/><i>[Outdoorsman spend by PP]</i><br/><br/>Billy is nervous. "Billy don't like this. Billy was in a madhouse once. Lost his head."<br/><br/>Freddie is sitting with the Taleb, annoying him, when a knock comes on the door. "I must get rid of this pest," says the young man. Freddie tags along with him.<br/><br/>The student opens the door. "The mosque is--"<br/><br/>A shotgun blast drops him.<br/><br/>Freddie snaps up his sawed-off and shoots off both barrels, sawing the gunman in half. Two men with pistols drawn are standing behind him. "It's Blakely! Kill him!" they shout in Arabic. He slams the door shut and latches it. <br/><br/>Gilbert heads towards the front, slamming hard into Freddie, who is dashing into the sanctuary while staring back at the entrance. Gilbert's gun goes flying.

He recognizes it immediately: his fiancee Constance.<br/><br/>He finds her chained to the wall in a cell. "Billy, what do you see."<br/><br/>"Pretty white lady. Got black hair..."<br/><br/>"Help me, George! They took me! They said something about Jackson! Help!"<br/><br/>Billy quickly unlocks her, and Pearkes embraces her.<br/><br/>"Don't worry. We'll get out of here."<br/><br/>Down in the sanctuary, Freddie hears the singing too now. Gilbert sidles towards what he thinks is the source. Suddenly he stops.<br/><br/>His gun comes up as he turns to face Freddie.<br/><br/>Blakely dives behind a column, as Gilbert shoots at him.<br/><br/>"Of course, Gilbert," purrs a feminine voice in the Frenchman's ear, "you must kill him. He is against our Love."<br/><br/>As Pearkes, Constance, and Billy head towards the stairs, he sees four or five men with rifles, wearing inverted ankh necklaces, coming  towards them. Pearkes fishes his last grenade out of his pack and flips it at them. Several drop, but the rest continue to rush up the stairs. Pearkes gathers his charges and heads the other way.<br/><br/>"Billy's excited, sir! This is just like fighting in Iraq!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Down in the sanctuary, Freddie calls out: "Alphonse, can you hear me?"<br/><br/>"Yes. Yes I can."<br/><br/>"Could you shoot that singer, not me?"<br/><br/>"No, Alphonse," whispers the voice. "That would be against our Love."<br/><br/>"Really, Gilbert, a man like you? A Soviet commissar? Helping a monarchist?"<br/><br/>Gilbert fires. "That's why I have shoot the capitalist!"<br/><br/>"All we be equal and shared in our love, Alphonse! Now kill him!"<br/><br/>Pearkes leads his group into a room that is clearly a holding chamber for some of the asylum's more unfortunate charges. They babble to themselves from the wall where they are chained.<br/><br/>As they try to dash for the door, the chains suddenly all fall off. All the inmates suddenly look, in unison, at them.<br/><br/>"Shakhti...Shakhti..." they chant.<br/><br/>In front of the door, a figure drops from the ceiling to the floor.<br/><br/><i>[At this point I gave PP a point of Stability for defending his fiancee, and for being a good sport about the inevitable reveal.]</i><br/><br/><br/>"Bertie!" calls out Freddie. "Would you like a raise?"<br/><br/>Gilbert shoots the pillar again, then pauses to reload.<br/><br/><i>[Both FP and GP were trying to figure out ways to break the spell. FP threw out a Bargain attempt here, but no go. I ruled that anything GP did to resist would be a Hard Driver--he could do it, but it would be an effort.

I warned that eventually it would be a Hard Driver to resist the command to use Firearms spends.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie squints through the gloom. He thinks he sees, perched up on the pulpit, a beautiful woman with pale skin--Turkish, or maybe Circassian. The way she sits on the pulpit--crouched forward, like a gargoyle--disturbs Blakely, but he decides to take advantage of Gilbert reloading to sneak closer to her.<br/><br/>Gilbert tries to resist the unrelenting command to shoot his boss, but the unearthly singing continues to sap his will.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Upstairs, Pearkes confronts one of the wives. "I'm just here for my fiancee. I have no quarrel with you."<br/><br/>"I have no quarrel with you either. So I just think I'll kill you."<br/><br/>"Couldn't we just call it a draw?"<br/><br/>"I tell you what. You have a point."<br/><br/>She throws a dagger at Constance's heart. Pearkes twists himself over, but fails to block it. Constance slumps to the floor.<br/><br/><i>[Athletics contest vs Al-Lamia, Shakhti's wife. And also a Stability check.]</i><br/><br/>The inmates pounce on Billy as he tries to flee. There is a flash of steel, and his kukri begins chopping at the limbs holding him down.<br/><br/>Pearkes dashes at her, drawing his sword as he does, and slashes at her throat. The vampire moves incredibly quickly, trying to block his sword, but his blow slashes right through her wrist, severing her hand.<br/><br/>"That hurt," she growls. "My turn."<br/><br/>She picks Pearkes up and throws him against the wall.<br/><br/><i>[I'm using the NBA critical hit rules, and I gave PP a refresh to weapons for the cool visuals.]</i><br/><br/><br/>Downstairs, Freddie lets both barrels off against Aaliyat, the vampire. He blows her off her perch.<br/><br/>Gilbert blinks. "Our Love abides," rasps the woman. "Slay Blakely."<br/><br/>Desperate, Freddie remembers the picture Gilbert keeps of him and his comrades from the Paris Soviet, the one he takes out and fingers sometimes.<br/><br/><i>[We found Gilbert's Symbol! "Le Sovi\xe8te du Paris, Novembre 1918" I had ruled in the past that refreshing Stability gives at least a chance to break a domination.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie begins to sing, in broken French, the Internationale.<br/><br/><i>[I couldn't resist singing most of it; I know it in French, but not English.]</i><br/><br/>As Freddie reaches the chorus, Gilbert's eyes fill with tears. He fishes out his photograph and unfolds it with trembling fingers.\n<blockquote><i>C'est la lutte finale<br/>Groupons-nous et demain:<br/>L'Internationale<br/>Sera le genre humain!</i></blockquote>\n<i>[Refresh accomplished! New Stability check. GP spent himself below zero, and got exactly what he needed; Aaliyat was out of magic points.]</i><br/><br/>Gilbert sprints forward suddenly. He grabs the woman's arm just as she, with unearthly grace, flips up in the air from a supine position. As she flips around, he jams his shotgun at just the right angle--the one he honed during his year with the Soviet commisariat--and fires both barrels at her neck.<br/><br/>Her head flies off and she collapses. Blood drenches Alphonse.<br/><br/><i>[Athletics spend, Scuffling roll, Forensics spend to get a bonus on the Firearms roll. Then he did boxcars for damage.

Faster than his eye can follow, Al-Lamia is by his side. She flips him over her head and across the room. As he rolls over her head, Pearkes slashes out but she simply moves out of the way with blinding speed.<br/><br/>She yawns. "You English are so boring."<br/><br/>Billy, covered with gore, continues to make quick work of the pile of inmates on top of him.<br/><br/><i>[I generally don't bother running combat for NPCs and just narrate it; in this case, the inmates were all Health 0 and as cracked as Billy is, he's more than their match.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes rolls over and draws his pistols. Standing up, he marches towards Al-Lamia, firing continuously. She rocks back as the Colts bark out, but continues to walk towards him.<br/><br/>"That was uncivil," she says, knocking the pistols out of his hand. "Look into my eyes."<br/><br/>Pearkes stiffens, his will sapped.<br/><br/>"Sister, shall we feast?"<br/><br/>Constance rises up behind him. "Don't worry, George. We'll live forever, together."<br/><br/>Pearkes embraces her. She begins to feed on his neck.<br/><br/>"Get back," snarls Al-Lamia. "I want to drink."<br/><br/>"He's mine," says Constance. "My husband."<br/><br/>They begin to fight.<br/><br/><br/>Billy comes downstairs. He laughs maniacally, while muttering in Pashto.<br/><br/>"Billy, stay here with Gilbert."<br/><br/>Billy eyes Alphonse with a demoniacal glint in his eye.<br/><br/>"No! Keep any women from coming. Gilbert..."<br/><br/>"Hrum?"<br/><br/>"Comrade Gilbert!"<br/><br/>"Yes!"<br/><br/>"Stay here with Billy." Freddie turns to the stairs.<br/><br/>Gilbert follows. "I'm Billy," cackles Billy, and follows them as well.<br/><br/><br/>Freddie steps into the hall. He sees a one-handed woman fighting with another woman, who does not look like Constance. He shoots the one-handed woman, and drops her to the floor.<br/><br/>"George, he killed our sister! Kill him!"<br/><br/>"...you don't have a sister!"<br/><br/><i>[Made this a Hard Driver as well: do what "Constance" said and gain 2 points, or don't and lose 4 points.

Pearkes raises his own sword.<br/><br/>Billy vanishes again.<br/><br/>Gilbert clubs his gun and rushes Pearkes, who he sees attacking his boss.<br/><br/><i>[Blasted Stability forced flight or fight; Pearkes was the obvious threat.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes swings at Freddie, and then falls unconscious.<br/><br/>"Hello," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Look into my eyes."<br/><br/>"No thanks. Mwimbe has spoken quite highly of you, and warned me."<br/><br/>Faster than the eye can track, she is next to Freddie. "Tell the doctor I said hi," she says, and throws him across the room.<br/><br/>Gilbert draws a stake and begins to slowly walk up behind her.<br/><br/>"You know my dear," says Freddie through bloody lips, "you're really quite beautiful. I can see why you're Shakhti Bey's favorite."<br/><br/>"Well, I'm certain I'm his favorite now."<br/><br/>"Yes, that Turkish girl didn't have anything on you."<br/><br/>She shrugs, and slams his head into the wall. "Father can always make more wives."<br/><br/>"Yes, well, this is a real opportunity for you. I'd be entirely delight to speak with the Bey. I understand that he's focused entirely on Egypt. I do have contacts..."<br/><br/>"Egypt is where the Dark God has assigned us. But I agree with you, Mr. Blakely. We could use a new ally."<br/><br/>And she bites his neck deeply.<br/><br/><i>[Flattery spend by FP; it did allow Gilbert to get up behind her.]</i><br/><br/>Gilbert jams the stake into her heart. She shrieks, and then turns around.<br/><br/>"That hurt. But I am not European!" she hisses.<br/><br/>Freddie staggers up, and slams his stake into her. She hisses, falls down, and dessicates before their eyes.<br/><br/><i>[Health spend by FP to keep conscious.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie cuts her head off. "Bertie?"<br/><br/>"Blarrrgh?"<br/><br/>"Right. I'll just bandage my own wounds."<br/><br/>Soon the sound of people speaking French and English comes up the stairs. Freddie drags Gilbert, Billy, and Pearkes into a cell, and closes it behind them. French military police, led by a British lieutenant, find them.<br/><br/>"I say, you're jolly well covered in blood!"<br/><br/>"It seems some crazy women got in here and began attacking people with knives..."<br/><br/><br/>As the MPs sort things out, Pearkes asks Freddie, "Where's Constance?"<br/><br/>"She went back to the hotel old man. Did you find anything up here?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes. Do you think she's all right?"<br/><br/>"Right as rain."<br/><br/>They find the blood trail again. In a cell, the door slightly ajar behind him, they find the Nessim, bleeding heavily.<br/><br/>"You were right, Mr. Blakely. They took the Girdle and killed the Ulamma. I will join them soon in Paradise."<br/><br/>He hands Freddie the Sword of Akmallah. Freddie holds it limply in one hand and gives it to the Colonel.<br/><br/>The Nessim grasps Pearkes' hand. "Beware. The sword has only one edge, but it cuts both ways. The sword cuts in the direction of its owner. Be very sure of what you are cutting."<br/><br/>Pearkes buckles on the sword.<br/><br/>"I'm sorry, Freddie. I'm very tired now. I think I will sleep." <br/><br/>Blakely closes his eyes as the Nessim breathes his last.<br/><br/><br/>At Shepheard's, Lord Allensby meets them "Well, Pearkes, this is pretty much a disaster."<br/><br/>"I should think so," says Freddie. "Cults running around Cairo!"<br/><br/>"I don't know anything about that, old man, and if you were smart you wouldn't either."<br/><br/>Pearkes convinces the front desk to put a call in to Montreal, where Constance is staying with the wife of another officer on overseas duty. He sinks into his bed with relief after speaking with her.<br/><br/>At midnight, while Alphonse and Anton are drinking wine and winning money from the other guests in a fixed game of poker, there is a tremendous row outside. "Blakely!"<br/><br/>Freddie finds Shakhti Bey being held back by MPs. "You think you can take something from me? I will take something from you. You have made a mistake tonight. Before, we were two players at the chessboard. Now, it is personal."<br/><br/>As he leaves, Freddie mutters "I thought it was already personal.

He rushes to Noor's room. Inside, Dr. Mwimbe knocks an antique oil lamp to the floor and covers it with a blanket.<br/><br/>"Foolish girl!" she hisses. Noor lies mumbling on the floor. "She has lit the Oil of Alhazrad," says Mwimbe. "It gives visions..."<br/><br/>Noor sits up. Her eyes are spinning aimlessly. "Nyarlathotep," she intones. "The Black Pharaoh. The Bloated Woman..."<br/><br/>She sits for some time, reciting hundreds and hundreds of words--names?--before finishing, over an hour later.<br/><br/>"Yog-Sothoth. <i>Yog-Sothoth!</i> YOG-SOTHOTH! <b>AZATHOTH!</b>" She collapses into Freddie's arms.<br/><br/>After some mint tea to brace her, she says what she saw in her vision. In two days, the star Algol--<i>al-Ghul</i>, the Ghoul's Head--will be in the correct position. Then the ritual will happen at the Sphinx. She saw a stele in her vision, near the Sphinx, that somehow leads to the city beneath the sands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Sheila!"<br/><br/>"Yes, Freddie? I mean, Mr. Blakely?"<br/><br/>"I have a sneaking suspicion that Shakhti Bey wants to kill you. I think the thing to do is that you should spend as much time with me as possible. At least that way I'll be there to die heroically trying to save you."<br/><br/>Sheila mists up. "I...I think I'd like that Freddie. I didn't know you cared about me like that."<br/><br/>"Well, you're the only one who's stayed with me--most people have run off, or are like Pearkes. I mean, the three people closest to me are a French psychopath, a Chinese sociopath, and you. You're the only one who isn't...violent."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Colonel Pearkes pays a visit to the fort to speak with Lord Protector Allensby. "What is it this time, Pearkes? We've got a bloody riot all through the old city."<br/><br/>"We'll have another riot if you don't send troops to the Sphinx."<br/><br/>"Old man, let's talk. You were a good commander in the war, but I don't think you're all there anymore. You were in a bit of a tiff at Shakhti Bey's, last night we found you covered with blood in an insane asylum, and then there was that riot in Alexandria. I've seen it happen, men come back from the front and they're fine for years, but slowly they just...slip. I mean, I still have nightmares about Iraq, and look at Lawrence--fine soldier then, now a total crackup! Have you heard the latest? He wants to drive a tank!"<br/><br/>"Just give me two platoons."<br/><br/>"With the city in riot? I can send you a squad with Enfields. Eight rather jolly fellows, just the thing."<br/><br/>"Couldn't you send a machine gun car?"<br/><br/>"To an antiquities site? Really old man, really. You can requisition anything reasonable from the motor pool. Now one other thing. This Blakely fellow--I'm afraid the Foreign Office is very interested in this man. Seems he's making a habit of bankrolling revolutionaries and enemies of the Crown. Spending time with Blakely may be deleterious to your career. There are plenty of officers on the inactive list, after all."<br/><br/><i>[Bureaucracy spend by Pearkes, and not a bad idea although I gave him a bit of a hard time. I had decided before hand that I wasn't going to get in the way of PP drawing upon British military resources; he has the Credit Rating, and it's in his character concept. Plus, I felt I had neutered him a bit before, and the Alexandria incident was a GMing low on my part.<br/><br/>That said, I had to tread a fine line here, although maybe I should have just given him the two platoons and seen what happened, after charging an appropriate amount. Of course, what is an appropriate amount for pushing other PCs out of the spotlight? I'm not sure. If we had been closer to the final bit of the Cairo arc, I probably should have handed over the soldiers; but as it was, I think it wasn't genre-appropriate at this beat.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes makes sure to requisition sabers for his soldiers, although they are puzzled about why they need a "wrist-breaker."<br/><br/><br/>Back at the hotel, Gilbert gets a hypnotherapy session from Dr. Mwimbe which leaves him feeling great.<br/><br/><i>[Eight-point psychoanalysis spend by Mwimbe.]</i><br/><br/>While Pearkes rests (except for breaking up fights between Billy and the other soldiers), Freddie heads to the embassy, where he is ushered in to the Ambassador.<br/><br/>"Rummy!"<br/><br/>"Why, Roly-Poly, how are you! What can I do for you?"<br/><br/><i>[CR spend by FP to make the Ambassador another Oxford man.]</i><br/><br/>"I'd like to speak to your...your man of intelligence affairs..."<br/><br/>"Ah, the spook! I can do that for you. However, I've received this strange notice from the Foreign Office--detain in country, do not allow to pass, all kinds of rubbish."<br/><br/>"Do you know Shakhti Bey? I think he's pulling strings."<br/><br/>"Impossible. It says something about you meddling in Egyptian politics. I'm going to tell them that Freddie couldn't meddle with his socks without a servant. Though you should stay out of politics, you know."<br/><br/>The intelligence attache proves to be one of those ramrod-straight, bloodlessly competent British officers. "What ho, Colonel!" says Freddie. "Shakhti Bey wants to kill me because I killed his wives."<br/><br/>"You shouldn't have killed his wives then."<br/><br/>"Well, he sent them to kill me! They're some kind of extra-dimensional killers! My God, man, aren't you the spy? Don't you know what's going on around here?"<br/><br/>"I am in charge of maintaining Imperial secrets, and what I know or don't know doesn't concern you."<br/><br/>"Well, what should I do about Shakhti?"<br/><br/>"My normal advice to Europeans who want to interact with Shakhti is to not interact with Shakhti. And in your case, if you go poking an anthill, it is best not to coat your arm in honey."<br/><br/>"Well, that's why I came to the types who can hire an anteater! So where's your anteater?"<br/><br/>"Our resources are rather strained."<br/><br/>"Well, howabout just letting me out of the bally country?"<br/><br/>"Ah, yes, that. It seems you're an intimate with Saad Zaghloul, who is opposed to our interests here. And you have a history of sympathy to Red causes. However, I can't but admit that many parties will be happy to see you leave Egypt. So keep your nose clean and I'll see what I can do..."<br/><br/>"Well, dash it all, you lot should really stop giving me contradictory orders! I mean, really, ask your superiors!"<br/><br/>Freddie leaves the Colonel bemused, happy that he may have succeeded in getting M's attention.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They prepare. Pearkes tests the Sword of Akmallah and discovers that it slices through bricks like reeds. Freddie finds himself disturbed by how obsessed Pearkes is getting with the weapon. Alphonse uses his contacts to get some firebombs. The soldiers amuse themselves while on guard duty.<br/><br/><i>Sunday, 5 April 1925</i><br/><br/>They motor out to the Sphinx. The local security patrol tries to keep them away but Pearkes waves them away. Nestled between the paws of the Sphinx they find the stele that Noor told them about, but Mwimbe's translation of the inscription leaves them unenlightened.<br/><br/><i>[With CP late, nobody had Cthulhu Mythos, and if Mwimbe noticed the incantation that activates the magic gate she didn't tell them.]</i><br/><br/>Gilbert searches around for evidence. He can tell that there have been gatherings here in the past, and he doubts that they are tourists. He seems to be able to make out a faint trail leading to some nearby ruins. With no other lead to go on, they drive out them. In the foundation of one of them, they find a stone slab that looks like it has been moved.<br/><br/>"Should we open it? We ain't supposed to mess with the antiquities," says the squad's corporal.<br/><br/>Gilbert gestures with his cigarette for them to lift the slab.<br/><br/>Beneath it, a narrow stair leads down into the earth.<br/><br/>"Any volunteers?" asks Pearkes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415645/#Comment_415645" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T20:50:20+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  8:50PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2013 8:56PM by Aviatrix.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: You Know Who I Am (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>"Now sir," says the squad's corporal, "I was an infantry officer on the Western Front--"<br/><br/>"An <i>officer</i>?"<br/><br/>"Yes sir, got demobbed and reupped, but there ain't much call for first lieutenants what got a battlefield commission. And what I learned, sir, was that there are times to advance, and times to sit in a ditch trying to keep from having your head blown off. And this is a ditch time, sir. Proper ditch time!"<br/><br/>Pearkes insists. After a last cigarette, the soldiers take a pistol each from Gilbert for close quarters fighting. One private elbows another. "I told you this would be a bleeding bug hunt."<br/><br/>They descend the stairs fifty or sixty feet at least down into the earth. They find a constricted tunnel that slopes gradually down. After a while, they reach an intersection. One passage slopes up, while the main passage continues down. Pearkes, studying the ground, determines that something heavy has been dragged down the upward-sloping passage and down through the main tunnel. They follow the trail.<br/><br/><i>[I actually did roll out a few of the random encounters on the list, but they proved to be as boring as I feared they would be, so I won't waste your time relating them.]</i><br/><br/>The main passage eventually opens out and a monumental staircase of glistening black marble leads down to a pair of enormous ebony doors. Seven wooden statues, carved to resemble the traditional half-human, half-animal forms, stand alongside the stairs.<br/><br/>Pearkes begins to descend the stairs, following the drag marks.<br/><br/>The statues spring from their niches and begin to attack!<br/><br/>One grabs Gilbert, knocking him down. The wiry Frenchman pulls his sawed off and fires. Bits of the statue fly off--and Gilbert shrieks, as he realizes that they are not statues, but mummies--and not mummies sewn together as a taxidermy project, but the actual mummies of some unknown and long-forgotten race.<br/><br/>Pearkes draws his pistol and fires into a mummy grappling him, disintegrating it in a shower of dust. Then he unsheathes the mighty Sword of Akmallah. It catches the light eerily as he swings it at two mummies, neatly separating their heads from their necks.<br/><br/>Freddie fires his sawed off shotgun at a mummy as it bites him. To his left, a hippo-headed monstrosity's fangs slice into Gilbert. The soldiers concentrate their fire on one mummy, destroying it, even as two of their own are ripped to pieces.<br/><br/>Pearkes slices the head off of another mummy, and the remaining soldiers kill the last one. Freddie gathers their remains and sets them on fire.<br/><br/>The corporal grabs Pearkes. "Right, none of us signed up for this. It's suicide, and we're leaving."<br/><br/>Pearkes puts on his iciest stare. "You leave now, and you're finished! I will hunt you down!"<br/><br/>The soldiers look at one another uneasily. "You can take that colonelcy and jam it up your arse," says the corporal, but three of the soldiers fall out and remain with the group.<br/><br/><i>[It didn't seem far-fetched that the soldiers would want to bug out after their first encounter with the supernatural. PP made a 3-point Intimidation buy, so he kept three of them.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie pushes the doors open. It is difficult to see inside, but the room is vast, and made out of the same reflective black marble. The walls on either side are so far away that he cannot see them in the light of his torch. Cyclopean pillars hold the vast vault up. Staring at the ceiling, Freddie notices that their tops seem to sway in the wind.<br/><br/>Far off, they see a dim glimmer of torchlight. As they approach it, they pass some steps that lead down into an unwholesome red light. Beyond that they encounter a black, still reflective pool.<br/><br/>Gilbert notices that the surface seems to ripple slightly. The pool is alive with leeches. Much to his disgust, he finds a small skiff tethered near some steps leading into the pool. Using the skiff's pole, he discovers that there are shoals of some kind of material in the pool. He prods one with the pole.<br/><br/>A human skull floats up. The shoals are the bones of the leeches' victims.<br/><br/>Beyond the pool they find a huge altar of some eerie, alien green stone. A broad walkway leads down from high on one wall to an enormous throne made of the same green stone.<br/><br/>On top of the altar, they find a sarcophagus. They try to open it with all their might, but the lid stubbornly refuses to move. Pearkes swings the Sword at it, but it is deflected harmlessly away.<br/><br/><i>[I was a bit railroady in this session, starting with the House Call To Adventure and continuing through the ritual. Folks seemed happy to board the train, but I'm not happy about it. I wish I could say it gets better later...]</i><br/><br/>Beyond the altar is an enormous hole in the wall. Pearkes throws a pebble at it but doesn't even hear it hit the ground. Freddie takes one of the fire bombs and uses it to set the leech pool on fire, which has the beneficial effect of illuminating the room; unfortunately, the room fills with a sickening smell.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415646/#Comment_415646" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T20:51:02+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  8:51PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2013 8:54PM by Aviatrix.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: You Know Who I Am (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>Suddenly they hear the sound of footsteps coming down the stairs, along with voices speaking in Arabic. The group scatters behind pillars as men wearing yellow robes and carrying torches march in. "What a terrible smell," one says. "They must not have taken out the last victim!"<br/><br/>"Usul probably set him on fire, he likes to do that."<br/><br/>They seem to be setting up for a large gathering, laying out priestly robes and roping off sections of the hall. "I can't believe we got stuck with this duty," one grouses. "I had to take off work for this ritual!"<br/><br/>Soon a large crowd of yellow robed cultists have filled the hall, including two high-ranking British officers, Starr and Barret, that Pearkes recognizes. The crowd is tensed up and anticipatory.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the horrible clangor of drums and trumpets is heard! Shakhti Bey appears at the top of the processional walkway, leading priests of the Cult who bear the Girdle, Crown, and Necklace of Nitocris.<br/><br/>Next come an honor guard of warriors stripped to the waist. In the middle of them is Broadmoor, clearly drugged to the gills, and Gardner, smoking a cigarette and trying to put on a bold face but clearly terrified. Behind them come the Clive expedition: Henry Clive, wearing the look of a man who has committed to do something but now is clearly over his head; Winfield, grinning like a maniac in anticipation of the evening's blood entertainment; and finally Sprech, his face open in mystic wonder.<br/><br/>And then, the trumpets blare again! An African woman in regal robes, wearing an Egyptian burial mask, descends the walkway. "M'Weru! M'Weru!" the crowd chants as she takes her place next to the altar.<br/><br/>Shakhti holds up his arms, as if embracing the moment. "NYAR GASHANNA!"<br/><br/>As one, the crowd shouts back, "NYAR SHTHANT!"<br/><br/>Shakhti continues in Arabic: "Tonight we are gathered to bring our Lord one step closer! For tonight, Nitocris will rise! Nyar Gashanna!"<br/><br/>The soldiers nervously look at Pearkes. "Steady men," he says.<br/><br/><i>[Actually, he started with a threat; I tried to remind him that he really needs to start doing this in the fiction, rather than just spending points--I was trying to do some Apocalypse World principles this session, and several times said "If you want to do it, do it." ]</i><br/><br/>Shakhti sweeps his hands to one side, and the lid of the sarcophagus falls off. Freddie shakes his head. It was just that easy?<br/><br/>"Decorate the body," says Shakhti. As the accouterments are fastened to the mummy inside, Sprech injects Broadmoor with another drug.<br/><br/>"I'm coming...I'm lost in space but I'm coming...I'm close...so close that I can see you! <i>I can see you</i>!"<br/><br/>Freddie and Gilbert throw their fire bombs at the altar. As flames splash on to the mummy, Broadmoor's voice changes. "Well, what shall I call you now? Gilgamesh? Al-Jiljamish? I know! I'll call you Jilly!"<br/><br/>Fire erupts around Shakhti as the look on his face changes from triumph to shock. "You never understood, did ya Jilly! Yeah, in Budapest in 1502, that was me projecting my mind forward in time! But the rest was me! You stupid, stupid man!"<br/><br/>The mummy stands up out of the sarcophagus. "You'll never believe what I put in there," says Broadmoor. "What the hell am I speaking, anyway? English? It's been a long time since I spoke that!"<br/><br/>Freddie shoots at Winfield. "Master?" he cries, as the mummy--still on fire--begins to attack Shakhti's priests.<br/><br/>M'Weru begins to laugh uproariously, continuing as she dashes up the processional ramp. Shakhti says some kind of spell on the mummy, which vanishes--only to reappear nearby, attacking.<br/><br/>Shakhti brings down his hands. Many people in front of him simply drop dead and fall off the processional. Pearkes' soldiers begin firing into the crowd. "Shoot the Europeans first," says Pearkes. They advance in fine form.<br/><br/><i>[Someday I'll write about how the Milgram/Stamford Prison Experiment keeps getting repeated in RPGs.]</i><br/><br/>As Clive and Sprech sprint away, Freddie and Gilbert dash up to rescue Broadmoor and Gardner. "Not so fast, this time," hisses Shakhti when he sees Freddie. A coruscating beam of black light lances from his hand towards Freddie, who shrieks in agony as he feels himself withering under the spell.<br/><br/><i>[Shriveling spell. Shakhti is old school. FP passed it off as "all my baby fat drops off, and my hair gets salt-and-peppered." Which I liked!]</i><br/><br/>"You keep swinging, and keep missing, Jilly!" taunts Broadmoor. In the crowd, Charleston drops the hood of his yellow robe and begins to head towards the altar.<br/><br/><i>[CP finally arrived, so we wrote him in as having attended the crowd in disguise. Me: "Well, you really did want to see the resurrection ceremony."]</i><br/><br/>Freddie hears a pistol cock behind his head. He turns to see Winfield, a gloating look on his face, which slowly changes to one of shock and surprise. He crumples to the ground. Behind him stands Gardner, with a bloody knife in one hand.<br/><br/>"Let's go," he says.<br/><br/>"You cannot hid from me, [gender slur]!" shouts Shakhti into the air. "I know where to find you! The City of Pillars cannot hide you forever!" He grabs the sarcophagus lid and crushes the mummy with it. "Come with me," he shouts at his priests, and they run down the stairs into the red light. There is a horrible cry and the head of one of the priests bounces up into the hall.<br/><br/>"So long, Jilly!" says Broadmoor, and then like a puppet with the strings cut she collapses into Freddie's arms.<br/><br/>The soldiers lead the charge up the processional bridge. They follow the tunnels back to the entrance in the ruins, blasting anything that gets in their way.<br/><br/>As Pearkes pulls himself out of the ground, a rifle is cocked in his face. A man wearing a uniform that resembles British battle dress, but with no insignia visible, straightens up. "It's all right, ma'am, it's the Colonel."<br/><br/>Freddie, Sheila, Gilbert and Charleston are soon standing in the ruins. A small group of soldiers rings a woman in a rather out-of-date white dress, leaning on her parasol. She has a scarf tied tightly around her neck. "Well, Colonel, you seem to have done all right for yourself."<br/><br/>"Thank you, M."<br/><br/>"I see you got my message," says Freddie. He hands her the Girdle, Crown and Necklace.<br/><br/>"These were not as useful for our friends as they thought," says M with a grim satisfaction. "It seems Shakhti knows his next destination--Irem, the lost city."<br/><br/>"Very good," says Freddie. "Well, I'm sure you can find some other operatives to--"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid I'll need your help on this, Colonel." Freddie smacks his head.<br/><br/><i>[Well, it's a train. But it's a Peace Train, right?]</i><br/><br/>"So far you haven't done too badly," continues M, "in that nobody very important is dead."<br/><br/>"Just where is it we're supposed to go?"<br/><br/>"The Lost City is supposed to be in the Empty Quarter of Arabia."<br/><br/>"You want us to go to bally <i>Arabia</i>!"<br/><br/>"There is a matter of time," says M, opening a pocketwatch.<br/><br/>"Um, M, you do know I seem to be unable to leave Egypt..." says Freddie.<br/><br/>"The way we're going, that won't be a problem."<br/><br/>"I was afraid of that."<br/><br/>"I think we need to be there in...say, twenty-four hours."<br/><br/>"How are we going to get there in twenty-four hours?" demands Pearkes.<br/><br/>*                     *                           *<br/><br/>The unrelenting sun beats down on an arid and rocky mountain range. Below it, the vast desert stretches out to the horizon. A small tan scorpion makes his way along the rocks under the watchful eye of a falcon.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the bird takes to the air. The scorpion scuttles for a hiding place.<br/><br/>A thrumming comes from beyond the mountains, growing ever-louder until with a roar an enormous dirigible plunges over them and out across the desert, heading towards a distant destination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415827/#Comment_415827" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T17:56:35+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  5:56PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So a couple of thoughts before I pick up the story again:<br/><br/>I've expressed some discomfort in my comments with how railroady this session got. I feel fairly bad about this, even though the session as a whole hummed and everyone, me included, enjoyed themselves. And the irony is, I had been reading a lot of stuff on Dungeon/Apocalypse world about letting players control the fiction more! Why, the next bit of the session I barely prepped at all--I went under the idea that I would "draw maps &amp; leave blank spaces" and they would tell me what was on the map.<br/><br/>But in the end we went with what had basically been in my head about where and what everything is. Plus, I nakedly railroaded them with M showing up.<br/><br/>So, lessons, maybe learned. One thing that occurred to me after the fact is that when you're dealing with a group like this one, that is used to more traditional GM/player interactions (GM states fact, players react), it's not enough to just ask plenty of questions: you have to structure those questions even more meticulously than you might in a more story-game oriented crowd. And occasionally, at first, I might need to break immersion temporarily in order to get the Players (not the PCs) to work on building the fiction.<br/><br/>Take Pearkes and the soldiers. If I just say something like, "what do you want?" or even "How many troops does Allenby give you?", the player may respond in a more trad way and go for the most stuff possible--a D&amp;D, "most toys" approach. (I have privately grumbled to myself that the only genre of storytelling where you go from victory to victory and just get better and better without confronting any tough choices is D&amp;D--not all D&amp;D, but it's in the bones so to speak.) But if I had stepped back and said, "Do you, PP, think that Allenby would give you two platoons? You were in the military, does that make sense? If he did, what might he expect? Would he give you any restrictions?" etc.--or even, since I notice that already I'm pruning back his request, something like "What will you do with that many soldiers? How do you plan to use them against the cult? What do you think the cult might do?"--to help the players keep inside the fiction. It's a bit odd, having to think about breaking immersion for the sake of strengthening the fiction; but on the other hand, I've seen that sort of thing happen a lot in Fiasco, at least in the early going, when folks are spitballing.<br/><br/>Of all the members of the group, FP gets the idea that he can introduce elements into the fiction the most intuitively, and he applies the most social pressure on the other players when they go a bit off-script. PP gets it but still likes to go for the power-play; CP more or less still relies on me to cue things, and GP tends to follow whoever's in the scene with him. This is a good sign, I think; in any case, they are a very good group and we've been playing together (except for GP, who was recruited for this campaign) for almost three years now, so we do tend to know how to work with each other.<br/><br/>Now back to the session!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415828/#Comment_415828" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T18:54:01+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  6:54PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: You Know Who I Am (Part 7)</b><br/><br/><i>Monday, 6 April 1925</i><br/><br/>A large, fluffy, white cat regards Freddie. "Mee-reow?"<br/><br/>"Go away, you furry pest." He shudders for a second, then turns back to watch Qusay paint the canvas walls of the dirigible. "M?"<br/><br/>From the "study", a few rooms away, a woman says in a measured tone, "We will have tea shortly, Mr. Blakely. Please don't bother me til then."<br/><br/>Freddie shrugs. Across the lounge from him, Dr. Mwimbe and Sheila are chatting; they have grown very tight over the last few days. Another cat walks by, and Freddie wonders just where the crew for the blasted airship is hidden.<br/><br/>Noor tells Charleston about her lighting of the Oil of Alhazred: "I had a vision! And it helped everyone! Also, I saw the Dark Lord and he threatened to drink my soul!"<br/><br/>"Let us talk about how we can bend him to our will," whispers Charleston. Freddie shakes his head again, takes out a cigarette, and then remembers at the last second not to light it.<br/><br/>The fluffy cat walks in, and nods its head--the signal for tea. "You do know you're absolutely terrifying, don't you," says Freddie.<br/><br/>They sit down around M. "Irem of the Pillars was a legendary city, now only remembered in fragmentary glimpses of the Quran and the 1001 Nights. We do not know where it is, but an explorer recently found a site we call the Nameless City. We believe Irem to be nearby. It is my personal belief that Irem is also closely associated with the City of Brass."<br/><br/><i>[If you know your Lovecraft, that's the nutter who found the titular city in "The Nameless City."<br/><br/>In prepping the campaign, I came across the story of the City of Brass in the 1001 Nights--and that sucker's practically a Cthulhu story, what with the madness and supernatural events.]</i><br/><br/>"M, just what do we do?"<br/><br/>"Simple. Find the city, find the queen, and prevent Shakhti from bending her to his will. As it so happens, we have a weather station in the area, and you can start your search there."<br/><br/>"I see. M, how can we get in contact with you?"<br/><br/>"I believe Colonel Pearkes knows the answer to that."<br/><br/>"She'll be in touch with you," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"Precisely. Now, gentlemen, time to hit the silk."<br/><br/>The dirigible begins to climb.<br/><br/>"We'll be at jumping altitude shortly," says M.<br/><br/>"What?" says Freddie. M nods towards a set of parachutes that have been neatly packed against the wall.<br/><br/>"You want me to jump out of a perfectly good dirigible?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"It's perfectly safe."<br/><br/>"Then you do it!"<br/><br/>"I have on a number of occasions."<br/><br/>"No, I mean now!"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid my business does not lie here. Two minutes, please."<br/><br/>Later, standing on the gangplank, looking uncomfortable in his harness, Freddie shouts back at M: "Just one question: what in God's name do you have on my Aunts to make me do these things?"<br/><br/>"You ask the wrong question, Mr. Blakely: it's what do your aunts have on me that you should wonder. Adieu."<br/><br/>They tumble through space. As he drifts down, Freddie spies some smoke coming from the hills to the north. Pearkes, with MacDonald strapped tightly to his chest, can detect sure signs of caravan trails leading to the north and west. Sheila tries to keep near Freddie as she floats down. Charleston sees a large salt pan to the southeast, and a large dust cloud approaching from the west--whether a storm or a group of people is impossible to tell. The weather station itself is almost beneath them--just a few tents, some water tanks, and a small biplane.<br/><br/><i>[Simple Athletics test for the jump.]</i><br/><br/>They spend some time regrouping. As they crest a dune, they see someone who Pearkes believes to be a soldier with a terrible sense of uniform discipline--he is wearing shorts, a bush hat, and a shirt with a garish Polynesian pattern.<br/><br/>"Hello, you'd be the Colonel?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"G'day, then. Name's Jakes. I have the honor of being a sergeant in His Majesty's Australian Army Corps."<br/><br/>"Were you in the war?"<br/><br/>"I was sir, I was at Gallipoli."<br/><br/>"That was a good fight."<br/><br/>"No it wasn't, sir, it was a bloody turkey shoot and we were the turkeys! If you don't mind the pun."<br/><br/>The weather station is even less impressive close up. In addition to the water and gas tanks, there is a beaten-up desert touring car. A sandy-haired man with a small blond mustache is working on the biplane. He introduces himself as Maxwell, the pilot.<br/><br/>After some discussion, they decide to send a small group north at evening to investigate the smoke they saw on descent--it is probably a Bedouin camp, and they may be able to get information about the area. So as the sun sets, Freddie, Pearkes, Gilbert, Charleston and Wazim set out in the car. <br/><br/>The dust cloud peters out around this time, still distant from the camp.<br/><br/>As the stars come out, they approach what is indeed a Bedouin village. The delicious smell of roasting lamb fills the air. As they walk in, the sounds of rifles being cocked surround them.<br/><br/>A tall man with an enormous beard walks up. "What ho," says Freddie in Arabic.<br/><br/>"You talk like an Egyptian idiot."<br/><br/>"I learned my idiocy in Egypt."<br/><br/>"That is unfortunate. Egypt is a terrible place."<br/><br/>They sit down to eat. Wazim and the Bedouin sheikh circle each other cautiously. "You are looking for something in the desert?" asks the sheikh.<br/><br/>"You wouldn't know anything about a city of pillars?"<br/><br/>Everyone stops talking at once.<br/><br/>"You should not go there. It is haunted by the jinns. Anyway, you will not find anyone who can help you. Why, certainly no foolish young boy would resist the word of his sheikh."<br/><br/>A rather jaded looking boy looks up. "No, it would certainly not be me!"<br/><br/>"And could we hire him?"<br/><br/>"No," says the sheikh. "He is our best goatherd, I cannot spare his labor."<br/><br/>"This is a rather poor box," says Freddie, offering the sheikh a set of pistols.<br/><br/>"No, I cannot accept. However, the Colonel has a very fine rifle."<br/><br/>"It is not a good rifle."<br/><br/>The sheikh takes the rifle and fires off a round. "You are right, it is not a good rifle. However, I will accept these gifts as a sign of the peace between us. And I will give you the boy Abdulqasir as a slave."<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll by FP to have the pistols, then Bargain.]</i><br/><br/>"Congratulations," says Freddie. Abdul puts down his comic book. "Thank you kindly master," he says in English.<br/><br/><i>[Abdul is not properly an Arabic name, although I used it in session; I've added "qasir"--"Slave of the powerful" is the full meaning of the name--for the writeup; now that he's with the Anglos, I'll just use Abdul, as they did.]</i><br/><br/><i>Tuesday, 7 April 1925</i><br/><br/>The next day they motor back to the station. "This is really dangerous," says Abdul from the back of the car.<br/><br/>"I say, did the sheikh send you to get a better education, or to get rid of you?"<br/><br/>"Probably the latter. Nobody in the tribe likes me."<br/><br/>"You have an American accent, Abdul."<br/><br/>"I learned English from American oil survey crews."<br/><br/>Once they reach the camp, Freddie tells Abdul that as he's on sovereign British territory, he is now free. The twelve-year old boy lights up a cigarette in response. "Will you still work for us?" asks Pearkes.<br/><br/>"Well, I could go back to my uncle who sold me into slavery. What do you guys do?"<br/><br/>"Well," says Freddie, "I'm a dilettante, Porgie there is a British soldier, Gilbert is a French valet, and Charlie is an American sociopath."<br/><br/>"I changed my mind.

Hm. I think one possibility is to decide the most you're willing to give or to come up with two or three options, e.g., "You can have two men and a rocket launcher, four men and a tank, or two squads of men, but no special equipment." (Or whatever -- I am not up on this sort of thing.)<br/><br/>Another, as you said, is to trust the player to be honest when he's slowed down and ask him, "Realistically, now, what do your military experiences tell you that your PC could get from this situation, and what would it cost you?"<br/><br/>Another is to let things go way, way off track, let him go hog-wild with All The Toys, and have mythos stuff show that it doesn't matter. I'm not sure you want to do that. It takes very good calibration, and may also involve railroading. It's a tricky, tricky call.<br/><br/>Hm, there's also the "I will give you all the toys, Mr. Jones, if you will do me a big favor first..."<br/><br/>But, with all of this? You may want to make sure that GP gets a scene somewhere in there where he can have his troops be wonderfully effective and things can go right.<br/><br/>I think a lot of this comes from differing ideas about how the game world works. You can reiterate your ground rules (Magic trumps science; cultists are everywhere; anything else I'm forgetting) and keep the dialogue going. And you can take a deep, deep breath and ask people, as a group and as individuals, what's working for them, what isn't, what could be done to make the game more awesome for everyone.<br/><br/>If you've got them looking out for each other on the meta-level -- making sure each player gets spotlight time and awesome time, everyone being a fan of everyone else -- then you're doing great! Let the game world burn!

Ah, but there's many a slip between...adventure design and rolling the dice...uh...aphorisms are hard :-)<br/><br/>A minor caveat: while I agree that reminding the players occasionally of How the World Works is a good thing (and I did in my last after-action report), I think there's also a disconnect between how the <i>storytelling</i> works. If you come from a trad D&amp;D, video game background, you're going to expect to accumulate All The Toys and never lose, not really; so whenever you're offered a chance to Upgrade Power, you'll take it.<br/><br/>Telling a different kind of story is an adjustment process under those conditions.<br/><br/>I do tend to agree that it is vital that players get to see their PCs succeed. I can speak from experience: nothing is more frustrating than building a character to express something or be able to do certain things and then not get to do them. (My ex played a martial PC in a homebrewed D&amp;D 3 game that made the caster-martial disparity <i>worse</i>; needless to say, she was pretty frustrated.) So Pearksie absolutely needs his moments to shine, to lead his platoon of tough-as-nails soldiers into battle.<br/><br/>In fact, this was the reason I had resolved to allow PP to draw upon the resources of the Empire, and gave him a squad to play with. Maybe I should have even let him have the Maxim gun (hey, what's a Stability check for if not to measure the results of gunning down hundreds of people?) Taking away a big chunk of the squad was a tough call for me--on the one hand, realism and the setting pretty much demanded that the soldiers try and quit after fighting mummies; on the other hand, we're back to nerfing PP. I suppose there's some question of what interpersonal skill you use--is Reassurance better than Intimidation there? Should I treat them as mechanically equivalent, or does the fiction interact with them? My judgement was that trying to frighten frightened people didn't work very well, but was that me letting my agenda take precedence?<br/><br/>These are tough questions :-) There does seem to be some kind of agenda conflict here and I have to think about it and how to respond in a more player-centric way.<br/><br/>Anyway, more adventure to come. I lost internet at my place last night, and I don't have the writeup work I did offline, so your patience while I sort that out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416029/#Comment_416029" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T19:38:58+00:00" title="June 11, 2013  7:38PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: You Know Who I Am (Part 8)</b><br/><br/><i>Wednesday, 8 April 1925</i><br/><br/>They have little trouble reaching the salt pan\u2014a vast expanse of white, rime-encrusted sand. It strikes Charleston as unusual that there is evidence of so much water in the past.<br/><br/>The dust cloud suddenly is seen once again to the west, closing leisurely.<br/><br/>\u201cAbdul, how long until we get there?\u201d<br/>\u201cIf we drive all night we can be there at dawn. Just in time to all die. We should not go any farther.\u201d<br/>It takes most of the day to cross the pan. The dust cloud is still visible, much closer.<br/><br/>In the late evening light, they discover a region of low, extremely weathered and ancient buildings. Most are barely higher than the waist of Freddie. The entire area has an air of extreme age, even when compared to Egypt.<br/><br/>\u201cHere we are, kindly master. THE NAMELESS CITY. As you can tell, it\u2019s a real going concern. They say Irem was nearby. Maybe they were built on top of one another.\u201d<br/><br/>Various sinkholes or pits exist between the buildings. Freddie lowers himself to the bottom of one. There is not much to see except six low openings\u2014maybe three feet high--leading off the shaft. A cool wind blows through them, chilling Freddie eerily.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat ho, Nitocris!\u201d he shouts into one of them. <br/><br/><i>Tocris\u2014tocris\u2014tocris\u2026</i> whispers the echo.<br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile the rest set up camp. Abdul sits smoking a cigarette, shaking his head.<br/><br/>\u201cAbdul, what do you expect to happen here?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh, not much kindly master. We\u2019re going to die tonight. The jinn usually come at night.\u201d<br/><br/>They have finished the last of the leftover lamb when suddenly Charleston gets a funny feeling. Something is moving out in the dark. They all stand up. Freddie catches a glimpse of something vaguely human, crawling around as if on all fours.<br/><br/>\u201cHello?\u201d he says?<br/><br/>One leaps on him. It bites him savagely as he levels his shotgun and fires.<br/><br/>Three of them charge out of the darkness at Charleston. His Tommy gun barks out, shredding them. He begins to circle the camp, spraying the darkness indiscriminately.  In the strobelight of his muzzle flashes, the ground seems to be crawling with creatures.<br/><br/><i>[I let CP just spray here, making one roll a turn while doing great execution, as they say. When he finally missed, that was when the drum\u2014Charleston uses the 50-round drum magazine\u2014ran out.]</i><br/><br/>The one on top of Freddie pulls out a bronze knife. In the dim firelight, all Freddie can make out is a noseless face with enormous crocodilian jaws and a pair of devil-like horns jutting out of its head.<br/><br/><i>[Our friends from \u201cThe Nameless City,\u201d the Masqut.]</i><br/><br/>Another pounces on Gilbert, who jabs his sawed-off into its guts and fires, causing it to collapse into dust.<br/><br/><br/>Pearkes draws the Sword of Akmallah. He leaps on top of a wall and swings at two of the creatures, neatly separating their heads from their shoulders. He pounces on the other one\u2014another swing and another head drops to the ground.<br/><br/><i>[\u201cYou separate its head from its shoulders\u201d became the Sword of Akmallah catchphrase.]</i><br/><br/>Meanwhile Charleston continues his Chicago Typewriting course. A few more blows of the Sword of Akmallah and the assault is over.<br/><br/>Pearkes sheathes his sword and saunters over to Freddie.<br/><br/>\u201cAh, Colonel\u2026the sword is still out.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIs it?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes, old man.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWell, you have nothing to worry about. I mean, we\u2019re friends, right? We are friends\u2026right?\u201d<br/><br/>Freddie gulps. \u201cWell, it\u2019s just that in camp, you shouldn\u2019t have weapons drawn\u2026\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d  Pearkes walks away, murmuring to the weapon.<br/><br/><i>Thursday 9 April 1925</i><br/><br/>The next morning they track creatures back to another sinkhole. They are discussing what to do next when the dust cloud suddenly appears in the morning sun, much closer.<br/><br/>Pearkes pulls up his binoculars. In the midst of the dust cloud, Pearkes sees a half-tracked vehicle, with a rather threatening looking cannon mounted on the back.<br/><br/>\u201cI need a rifle,\u201d says Pearkes.<br/><br/>\u201cWe traded it to the Bedouin!\u201d says Freddie.<br/><br/>Pearkes studies the vehicle more. The driver is wearing some kind of brown uniform. \u201cI think they\u2019re military,\u201d he says.<br/><br/>The cannon on the half-track barks, and a shell drops behind the group\u2019s camp. Pearkes frowns\u2014that was a message that they are already in range of the gun.<br/><br/>Freddie pulls out a white handkerchief, while Charleston and Gilbert run for sinkholes and leap in. (Slipping and sliding, they both reach the bottom unscathed in their respective holes.)<br/><br/>Soon the half-track pulls to a halt in front of Pearkes and Freddie. Two men step out and cock heavy Tokarev pistols.<br/><br/>\u201cAre you armed?\u201d one says with a heavy Russian accent.<br/><br/>\u201cYes.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cPlease give us your weapons. Or we will shoot you.\u201d<br/><br/>While Pearkes hands over his pistols and his Sword, a man in a fedora, with a handkerchief tied over his face to block out the dust, steps out of the vehicle.<br/><br/>\u201cAh, Colonel Pearkes,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Blakely.\u201d<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416127/#Comment_416127" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T19:29:12+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  7:29PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: You Know Who I Am (Part 9)</b><br/><br/>"Haven't seen them in a while," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"I find that rather hard to believe. They seem attached to you at the hip. <i>Tovarischii...</i>"<br/><br/>"Hello!" says Freddie, stepping out from behind a low wall.<br/><br/>"Ah, Mr. Blakely! You may remember me. I am Mr. October. Where is Mr. Gilbert?"<br/><br/>"Funny thing that--you know in Egypt, he tried to shoot me? Something about raises and capitalism. I'm being honest."<br/><br/>"I find it hard to believe you are ever honest. What is it that interests you in these ruins?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I was told to go here. Something about the F.O. being unhappy with me messing with the locals."<br/><br/>"I take orders too, from the Central Committee, who tell me to be interested in <i>you</i>. And I am interested! Now, <i>where is Mr. Gilbert</i>?"<br/><br/>Freddie shrugs. Some Russians tie his hands behind the back. He sits down on the halftrack next to Abdul, who is chatting in Russian with the guards.<br/><br/>Looking at the four sleeping bags on the ground, October asks Freddie who his companions are. "Well, Pearksie, Bertie, and my driver..."<br/><br/>"Where is your driver?"<br/><br/>"I imagine he's hiding from you, reloading his machine gun."<br/><br/>There is a surprised shout. Two soldiers reappear, dragging the corpse of one of the creatures who attacked the camp the night before.<br/><br/>"What is that thing?" says October.<br/><br/>"Oh, you've found the jinn. Some kind of mummy."<br/><br/>"That is not a human being."<br/><br/>"No, I guess it's not."<br/><br/>Soon the sinkhole the creatures emerged from is discovered. October orders the halftrack moved over and the winch set up to lower everyone inside the pit.<br/><br/>"So, is it Comrade or Mister October?"<br/><br/>"Mr. October is fine."<br/><br/>"What is it you want from Bertie?"<br/><br/>"Mr. Gilbert was ordered to appear before the Central Committee of the Internationale. He instead fled to America to engage in petty brigandry."<br/><br/>"Well, he did do that."<br/><br/>"He also absconded with books, treasury, and military secrets we entrusted with him."<br/><br/>"That does explain how he got to America so easily."<br/><br/><i>[FP made a Flattery buy to engage October.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Three guards stand nervously around the winch, smoking. The entire area creeps them out, which is saying something for active-duty NKVD troopers.<br/><br/>There is a noise of dragging from further out, near one of the sinkholes. The guards look at each other and finally one decides to check it out. He approaches the edge of the pit and suddenly stops short.<br/><br/>One of the desiccated mummies is sitting up on the edge. <br/><br/>The soldier stumbles forward, trying to see into the darkness below. Suddenly, there is a blinding flash of light. Stunned, he gropes forward.<br/><br/>A hand seizes his wrist.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>[Photography buy to give a bonus to Scuffling.]</i><br/><br/>The two guards remaining at the winch jump in shock as their comrade suddenly falls into a pit. One rushes out while the remaining guard cocks his Thompson gun.<br/><br/>He hears something behind him. He whips around, jerking the machinegun around.<br/><br/>Nothing.<br/><br/>Relieved, he turns back and nearly bumps into a man with glowing red eyes.<br/><br/><i>"Wouldn't it be nice to take a dip in this pool next to us? Just take a step..."</i><br/><br/><i>[CP blew all his magic points and a chunk of his Stability to cast Dominate.]</i><br/><br/><br/>The scream brings back the last guard. He looks around wildly, and then throws himself against one of the ruined buildings, back to the wall.<br/><br/>Someone drops to the ground from the top of the wall. Before he can get his gun up, a fist smashes into the back of his neck and the world goes black.<br/><br/><i>[Intimidation buy by CP, then a called shot to the head. GP had to leave at this point, which is why Charleston went all ninja solo.]</i><br/><br/>Leaving Gilbert to guard the winch, Charleston lowers himself into the ground.<br/><br/><br/>At the bottom of the sinkhole, October, the NKVD, Freddie and Pearkes find a low opening that was probably quite a tall hallway for the denizens of the Nameless City. They advance down it, past strange wall murals that resemble no human style of art.<br/><br/>Suddenly, two of the Russian soldiers are seized by the ankles. Strong inhuman arms drag them into low holes at the base of the wall. Their screams don't last long.<br/><br/>"Maybe we should leave," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"Maybe we should keep going as fast as we can," counters October.<br/><br/>Far away, they hear a faint noise like the roaring of the sea.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416174/#Comment_416174" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T10:22:31+00:00" title="June 13, 2013 10:22AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry the last two have been so short--haven't had as much time to work on them at night. We're fairly close to the end, although there's about two and a half hours of recording remaining in this session. Some big revelations to come, and a couple of fights.<br/><br/>Been meaning to mention this, but you may have noticed that I reference songs in the episode names (after the first, "The Passion of Jackson Elias" which kind of suggested itself.) This is a crochet of mine--I like allusions--but it also probably has some unconscious meaning in how I frame the episodes, as I usually have a good idea what the title will be before the session.<br/><br/>For the record:<br/><br/>Session Two references the first line of the French version of the <i>Internationale</i><br/><br/>Session Three quotes the title (and chorus) of <i>Night Comes On</i> by Leonard Cohen<br/><br/>Session Four was a reference to David Bowie's <i>Aladdin Insane</i>. (I'd been listening to a lot of Bowie at the time. Still figuring out how to work in <i>Life On Mars</i>.)<br/><br/>Session Five returns to Leonard Cohen, somewhat fitting as it closes the Egypt arc. Also, while <i>You Know Who I Am</i> probably references Big-G God, some of the words fit the Big N pretty well: "I am the one who likes changing/From Nothing/To One"...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416232/#Comment_416232" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T19:02:02+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  7:02PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: You Know Who I Am (Part 10)</b><br/><br/>Charleston spends a moment rigging the winch so that he can detonate it from the bottom of the pit if necessary, then has Gilbert lower him down.<br/><br/>He soon hits the trail of the Russians, passing a puddle of blood in one long corridor. Up ahead, he hears voices and begins to rush towards them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie, October and company emerge from the long gallery into an enormous cave. Gigantic pillars fill the space, holding up the vaulted ceiling.<br/><br/>"Irem of the Pillars," whispers October. "I did not believe it existed..."<br/><br/>The faint sound of the ocean seems louder.<br/><br/>"Comrades!" someone shouts from behind them. Charleston sprints up to them. "I think I was being followed."<br/><br/>"Nobody is coming now," says October. "And what happened to the three guards I left up there?"<br/><br/>"This is my driver," says Freddie, explaining nothing.<br/><br/>"I'm a <i>journalist</i>," says Charleston.<br/><br/>October cocks a pistol and holds it to Freddie's head.<br/><br/>"Hey, wait, you need me," says Charleston.<br/><br/>"Indeed," says October. "Just give us your gun."<br/><br/>"Well, just a moment..."<br/><br/>"May I offer a compromise?" says Freddie. "You give them your gun, and they don't shoot me in the head."<br/><br/>Charleston hands over his gun, but keeps his camera. He begins to take pictures. "Mr. October, here's one of you! 'The Hero' we'll call it."<br/><br/>October turns away; Charleston notices he is still keeping his mouth covered with a bandanna. (Freddie has speculated this is because of World War I wounds.) "No, Mr. Chiu. I must work from the shadows. Darkness becomes me, don't you think?"<br/><br/>The area around them, while showing signs of having been made by some completely unknown human civilization of great antiquity--predating all of recorded history--is still obviously of human construction. The next section, however shows no such sign. Whether it is the angle that stones have been cut at, or the subtly misshapen archway, the entrance they come across now is clearly alien or at least non-human. And it does not resemble the ruins they found on the surface at all.<br/><br/>The roaring noise is closer. Charleston feels a mental pressure on his mind, as if something was pressing in on him.<br/><br/>They follow Charleston's lead deep into this strange complex. The black stone of the walls seems to reflect the light...wrong, somehow. Guided by his sense of <i>presence</i>, Charleston leads them at last to a strange archway. Some kind of enormous room lies beyond.<br/><br/>The sound of the ocean is very loud now.<br/><br/><i>[Right about now I gave CP a point of Stability for following his new Drive, "Thirst for knowledge."]</i><br/><br/>"Men, stay back and guard," says October.<br/><br/>Charleston studies the archway. Alien characters are inscribed there. He remembers, dimly, having seen something like them in the <i>Al-Azif</i>...<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos buy by CP; 1 Sanity and 3 Stability was the cost</i><br/><br/>"Here...lies the High Priest...waiting the end of days...when the stars are right...when that which is dead...awakes and returns..." he reads, but in Aklo, so no one can understand it.<br/><br/>"Why don't you go in," suggest October with a wave of his gun.<br/><br/>"Certainly," says Charleston. He turns around and walks in backward.<br/><br/>"Very amusing Mr. Chiu."<br/><br/>Charleston feels a force boring at the back of his neck.<br/><br/>"Turn around, Mr. Chiu, or I will just shoot you. I grow tired of your escapades."<br/><br/>"All right." Charleston spins around, closing his eyes as he does. "Yes...yes...riches and knowledge," he says, walking forward, eyes still sealed.<br/><br/><i>[I had to think very hard right here as to whether CP would get a Sense Trouble roll. He finally convinced me he should.]</i><br/><br/>Suddenly he stops, one foot poised in the air. He has suddenly realized there's no more floor in front of him.<br/><br/>He looks down and cracks open one eye...<br/><br/>He sees a great, slimy, scaly, green leg, of enormous size. It stretches below him, as if some gigantic figure was standing at waist-height in front of him. Slowly, as if compelled, he lifts his eyes, looking at the gigantic torso, the flabby bat-like wings, to a great tentacled head...<br/><br/>The tentacles lash at him, but strangely Charleson realizes that it is somehow imprisoned and if he just stand still he is safe.<br/><br/>Words form in his mind:<br/><br/>I AM GLAD THAT ONE WHO CAN HEAR ME CAME TINY MIND SO LACKING IN KNOWLEDGE I WILL GIVE YOU KNOWLEDGE IF YOU SET ME FREE<br/><br/>Everything except the roaring noise of the ocean is drowned out. Charleston grimaces under the mental onslaught, like a spike being driven into his brain.<br/><br/>He turns around to see if the Russians are still there. They start at the sight of his terrible visage, twisted with more than human knowledge.<br/><br/>Charleston looks around. There is a freizework surrounding the great circular pit the creature is standing in. For some reason, although the symbols are nothing alike, it reminds him of the pink stone Nyiti of El-Wasta gave him. He suspects that breaking the inscription would somehow free the monster.<br/><br/>DO NOT DELAY RELEASE ME<br/><br/>"Wait, how do I do that?"<br/><br/>YOU ARE AS FOOLISH AS THE OTHER HUMANS BREAK THE INSCRIPTION FREE ME<br/><br/>"I think we should just shoot him," says October to Freddie.<br/><br/>"You should probably check to see if it is warded," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"How? I see only air?"<br/><br/>"Trust me. Just shoot a little off to the side."<br/><br/>October fires his pistol. The bullet passes easily through the archway and close to Charleston's ear.<br/><br/>He turns around. "Now who did that? That was rude!"<br/><br/>"What is you see, Mr. Chiu? Perhaps you better step outside."<br/><br/>Something seems to reach inside Charleston's mind and his will snaps like a twig. He whips around and drops to his knees.<br/><br/>DO NOT MAKE ME FORCE YOU<br/><br/>"Force me to do what?"<br/><br/>FREE ME FREE ME FREE ME<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie asks October for a rope. The NKVD agent pauses, and then asks one of the guards to give the Englishman what he wants.<br/><br/>Freddie makes a simple lasso, tosses it around Charleston, and drags him back through the archway. When he is almost through, Charleston stands up and walks in without resisting.<br/><br/>October comes up and puts his pistol at Charleston's head. The sometime journalist rolls forward suddenly, kicking the pistol out of October's hand, spins around, and catches it.<br/><br/>"All right Comrades, everybody put your guns down."<br/><br/>Pearkes grabs the Sword from the guard near him.<br/><br/>KILL THEM KILL THEM ALL<br/><br/>Charleston shoots Freddie.<br/><br/>"For God's sake, man!"<br/><br/>The Russians dive for their guns. Pearkes comes up behind October and cross-checks him through the archway. He falls back, stumbles, then looks up.<br/><br/>He stands up, and then kneels and bows.<br/><br/>Then he begins to attack the freizework with his knife.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Charleston shoots Pearkes. The colonel shrugs it off and decapitates two of the Russians with the Sword of Akmallah.<br/><br/>The other Russians pause for a second, staring wide-eyed at Pearkes.<br/><br/><i>[2 point Intimidation buy from PP.]</i><br/><br/>The archway suddenly collapses behind them. There is a tremendous rumbling and the corridor begins to collapse.<br/><br/>"Well, don't just stand--" shouts Freddie as he sprints past them.<br/><br/>Taking the hint, the Russians take off after him.<br/><br/>Charleston, the mental control relaxed, sticks the pistol in his belt, scoops up his Thompson gun, and follows them.<br/><br/>Chaos ensues. As they rush through the hallways, arms snatch at them from--the mummies have returned. Two more Russians fall to them. <br/><br/>Freddie, running in sheer terror, finally manages to find a passageway sloping up. He burst through into daylight, followed closely by Pearkes.<br/><br/>Charleston rushes after them, but pauses frequently to look at the strange murals. They seem to show a city in the sands, a city that somehow is there and not there. He begins to slow even as the corridors shake and walls buckle.<br/><br/>He is standing there, enraptured, when the mummies find him.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416387/#Comment_416387" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T20:42:24+00:00" title="June 15, 2013  8:42PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: You Know Who I Am (Part 11)</b><br/><br/>Freddie looks at Pearkes.

Cruelty? Betrayal, dishonesty?"<br/><br/><b>POWER</b><br/><br/>Both Charleston and the creature begin to dematerialize. Charleston stares in horror as the building blocks of the universe seem to fall away. For a moment he has a vision of a great city in the sands, and a strange formula suddenly fills his head...<br/><br/><i>Friday, 10 April 1925</i><br/><br/>The next morning at dawn, they find Charleston, arms folded neatly across his chest, sleeping peacefully on top of a dune--a dune in a place where Freddie is sure there was a sinkhole the night before.<br/><br/>Charleston sits up suddenly. He looks in very good health. "I know a new spell," he says. "The Dho-Hna Formula. I need Noor. Bring her to me."<br/><br/><i>[I should mention in passing that I took much of the details of Irem/the Nameless City/The City of Brass not only from Lovecraft, but from the 1001 nights, especially the next section.

So it worked nicely.]</i><br/><br/>"You see," continues Charleston, "sometimes there's a city here, and sometimes there's not. Sometimes there's another city, I think. Maybe its three cities. Anyway, I can bring it here."<br/><br/>He writes something in the sand. "Here, you went to college, you should be able to follow this."<br/><br/>"Old boy, I don't even know what numbers you're using."<br/><br/>"Numbers? You can't write this in <i>numbers</i>. Like...you know how 2+2=4?"<br/><br/>"Yes?"<br/><br/>"Sometimes it doesn't!

Noor gets out.<br/><br/>"Charleston, you look different?"<br/><br/>"Thank you. I haven't bathed in three days."<br/><br/>They rig up a tent, and Charleston explains what happened to him.<br/><br/>"Charleston, you have done a terrible thing! You should not have done it!"<br/><br/>"You are correct. However, we are going to cast a spell. You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and there you have it."<br/><br/>They begin the ritual, which seems to consist of writing things on a long strip of paper. Then Charleston says a Word, which resounds like a thunderclap in everyone's mind. A wind springs up, blowing down the tent, and kicking up a sandstorm. The sand seems to hang in the air, solidify...and suddenly a wall is there, with a gate in it.<br/><br/>Freddie pulls up the halftrack and uses it to clamber up to the edge of the wall and peek over. He freezes for a moment, then stands up and walks forward.<br/><br/>He falls off the wall on the other side, vanishing from sight.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416388/#Comment_416388" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T20:43:12+00:00" title="June 15, 2013  8:43PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: You Know Who I Am (Part 12)</b><br/><br/>Pearkes rigs a rope to Charleston, who climbs up to the top of the wall. At first he sees nothing. Then, suddenly, a man in a black suit is standing next to him.<br/><br/>"Hello, Charleston."<br/><br/>"Hello. Are you who I need to see?"<br/><br/>"Me? I'm just the Messenger. Why do you wish to go into the city? There's nothing here for you. Forget your friend. He's lost. We'll take care of him."<br/><br/>"Well, that's just it, I need to find him. We need him."<br/><br/>"What do you think you'll find in the city?"<br/><br/>"Freddie Blakely."<br/><br/>"You may find Freddie there. I can't guarantee it. You'll find many things in the city."<br/><br/>"Is that your message?"<br/><br/>"No. My message is, Give up now, your cause is lost, you should just go home--I here you have a lot of things to do, now. In return, I'll tell you a few things about the universe."<br/><br/><i>[CP wanted to Assess Honesty, but I had to tell him that it wouldn't work on a non-human entity. For a spend, I told him that he was an extra-dimensional being, and that he was lying, but there was no way to know what he was lying about.]</i><br/><br/>"I'm going over, I'm going to find Freddie."<br/><br/>"Okay...I could have told you some things. But you don't want to know, no problem for me."<br/><br/>Charleston topples over the wall. The rope pulls him up short and he is able to drop down near Freddie. He gives the Englishman a kick in the ribs. "Freddie, are you awake? You seem to have landed on your ribs!"<br/><br/>"You're not three beautiful women..."<br/><br/>Charleston helps Freddie up. The area is beautiful--the buildings are furnished with gold and silver fittings, the wood is made of teak, pleasant fountains of alabaster stand in broad marble-tiled squares.<br/><br/>Together, they open the gates from the inside, and Pearkes and Noor enter the city. "This is out of the Arabian nights!" says Noor. "If I remember my stories, in the center of the city, you will find a mummified queen!"<br/><br/>The city is truly astonishing, like something out of the Quranic stories of Paradise. The craftsmanship is literally supernatural. They notice, however, that the city is extremely quiet--even the fountains have a hushed sound.<br/><br/>At the center of the city they find a fabulous pillared pavilion that rises into the sky.<br/><br/>At the center of the pavilion, inside a tower, they find a catafalque covered in rubies on a dais. Four enormous statues of armed guards, carved out of a mysterious black stone with scimitars raised, stand on each corner of the dais. In the center of the catafalque, in a shaft of blinding sunlight that obscures her features, is a woman in a white gown.<br/><br/>"What ho, Nitocris? We're here because of this Shakhti Bey fellow."<br/><br/>There is no response.<br/><br/>Pearkes raises his sword in salute. The statues bow their heads in response.<br/><br/>Freddie fishes into his pocket and comes out with a pair of dark spectacles.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness buy by FP.]</i><br/><br/>Putting them on, he can finally see the face he is staring at:<br/><br/>Hypatia Masters.<br/><br/>"Hypatia, old girl! What are you doing here?"<br/><br/>She makes no response. Her eyes are closed and she remains as immobile as if she was dead.<br/><br/>Freddie cautiously ascends the dais. Hypatia's eyes fly open, and she steps out of the light. She says something that only Freddie can make sense of, and only dimly--it's been a long time since he'd studied Koine Greek:<br/><br/>"What year is it?"<br/><br/>"1925. Do you still speak English?"<br/><br/>"<i>1925</i>?" she blinks, and suddenly seems to recognize who she is talking to. "Why, Freddie Blakely, as--well, mostly live, and mostly breathe."<br/><br/>She looks at Pearkes, Charleston, and Noor: "Don't know you...don't know you, but I want to...silly little girl, I don't care about. Freddie Blakely! 1925! Wow, I knew it would happen eventually, but I really never thought I'd get past 1919 again. Been a very long time."<br/><br/>"Indeed. By the way, were you talking to us the other day, during some kind of resurrection ritual?"<br/><br/>"Was there a mummy?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Oh, yeah. I left that. It's kind of like a recording."<br/><br/>"You've met Gilly then?"<br/><br/>"What? Jilly's around? Oh, he's always good fun. I hate that son of a bitch. I've hated him since I first met him. Do you know what it's like to hate somebody for 3500 years?"<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes, I met him around...2500 BC? I didn't have a calendar."<br/><br/>"Hypatia, when I last met you, you didn't seem like somebody who was 3500 years old."<br/><br/>"Oh, I wasn't. I was about...19 back then?"<br/><br/>"Don't think about it too hard," says Charleston.<br/><br/>"Your amusing little friend, he has the right of it. It's nine-dimensional."<br/><br/>"I assume you're some mystical creature," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"No, I'm human. Mostly."<br/><br/>"I see. Well, can you do anything about Gilly? He seems to be bent on hurting you."<br/><br/>"No...not now, not when he's already in the city."<br/><br/>"He's in the city?"<br/><br/>"About five minutes away."<br/><br/>"Fantastic! Do you know any way to stop him?"<br/><br/>"Cut of his head? That usually works for a while."<br/><br/>"A while? A human lifetime?"<br/><br/>"Depends on the Dark Lord. When did I last see him? Muscovy, 1722. Boy, he was an ***hole in Russian too..."<br/><br/>"I'm afraid you've left me a bit behind, Hypatia."<br/><br/>"Well, sorry Freddie. I think differently than you do. I like, use my brain. He gets it." She looks at Charleston curiously. "When did you Awaken?"<br/><br/>"Just recently!"<br/><br/>"Oh...oh, you're so young! Poor baby!"<br/><br/>"I say, Hypatia," continues Freddie, "is there anywhere we could go while you and Gilly have it out?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I don't want to talk to him, actually, so if you can find a way out, we should take it."<br/><br/>"Could we just leave?"<br/><br/>"Walk out? Sure, we could try that. I mean, I know some tricks, but I don't want to have to bring the Dark Lord into this, that's always a drag."<br/><br/>"Oh, him again," mutters Charleston.<br/><br/>"Hey! There's no <i>him again</i> when it comes to the Dark Lord. Hey Freddie, give a girl a drink."<br/><br/>Freddie hands her his flask. "Ah! I don't know if it was worth waiting 1500 years for, but it was pretty good." She pets him on the head. "He's like a puppy dog!" she says. "Why, I could just eat you up!"<br/><br/>"I'd prefer if you didn't!"<br/><br/>At that moment, Omar Shakhti strides in.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416437/#Comment_416437" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T19:32:29+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  7:32PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2013 10:05AM by Aviatrix.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: You Know Who I Am (Part 13)</b><br/><br/>He coolly looks around the chamber. Then he glances back. "Dog!"<br/><br/>Henry Clive scampers in. "Yes, Master!"<br/><br/>"Shakhti Bey, how good to see you again," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"I wish I could say the same."<br/><br/>"I was just having the most interesting conversation with Hypatia..."<br/><br/>"Ah, yes. My queen. How marvelous to see you again."<br/><br/>"Look, I'll just let you two talk things over..." says Freddie.<br/><br/>"No, I really don't want to say anything to him," says Hypatia.<br/><br/>Nobody moves for a second. Pearkes twitches.<br/><br/>Shakhti turns towards him with a snarl. Black tendrils wrap themselves around Pearkes' head, and he shrieks as his life force is pulled out of him.<br/><br/>"Strange," mutters Shakhti. "My children <i>need</i> to drink blood, where I just <i>enjoy</i> it."<br/><br/>Pearkes staggers up from his knees. As he reaches for his sword, a tongue lashes itself around his neck. Hetep growls as it begins to change in to its humanoid form.<br/><br/>"Really, Shakhti? Really?" drawls Hypatia. A coruscating beam of light lances out at the wizard. He raises a hand and it splashes away from him, but Hypatia continues to hold the beam on him.<br/><br/>Freddie skulks into the shadows and comes up behind Pearkes, who is struggling to keep from choking. Blakely neatly slides the Sword of Akmallah out of its sheath.<br/><br/>Pearkes draws his revolver and fires a shot at Shakhti and a shot at Hetep. The bullet bounces away harmlessly from the Egyptian, but Hetep snarls as the shot hits home.<br/><br/>To Charleston's nine-dimensional sight, the shield of power surrounding Shakhti is weakened slightly by Pearkes' bullet. He cocks his Tommy gun and sprays the Bey indiscriminately. Bullets pool at the base of Shakhti's feet.<br/><br/>Bleeding, the humanoid Hetep slashes viciously at the Colonel, who screams in pain as he reaches down to his belt and slashes at the tongue with one of Billy's kukris, but the blade can't cut through the otherwordly fibers of the strange appendage.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll by Pearkes to have a knife.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie nonchalantly walks up to Shakhti. "Blakely, your death will come soon!" growls Shakhti.<br/><br/>"God, you're melodramatic," Freddie says, and slices at his neck.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance buy by FP to get a bonus, followed by a critical hit! Unfortunately, he rolled snake eyes...]</i> <br/><br/>The sword stops at the edge of the shield, and then to Shakhti's astonishment it begins to slide through. There is a snapping noise and the shield breaks.<br/><br/>"You'll pay for that," says Shakhti.<br/><br/>"You've been saying that for weeks--"<br/><br/>Shakhti picks up Freddie and throws him into a wall. The Englishman staggers up for a moment, and then collapses.<br/><br/><i>[As FP is fond of saying, Freddie is not a combat character, although he mixed it up in this game. He tried to make a health spend to stay conscious, but failed and collapsed.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston raises his Tommy gun.<br/><br/>"Now wait! We can talk about this!" says Shakhti. "I can teach you so much--"<br/><br/>The gun blazes at him. Shakhti is hit multiple times, staggering back. Charleston takes a step forward, and then stop as the Bey looks up at him, eyes flashing red.<br/><br/>Pearkes drops to his knees. "Hypatia--" he says thickly.<br/><br/>"Oh...oh....all right." She flicks a bolt of black light at Hetep's tongue, severing it, and then kicks the Sword of Akmallah over to him. Filled with bloodlust, Pearkes slowly stands up using the Sword as a prop, then he leaps in the air, slashing down viciously at Shakhti.<br/><br/>The sword slices cleanly through his neck. He vanishes in a puff of dust as Hetep shrivels up into a mummified cat corpse.<br/><br/>"Nice work, Pearkesie," says Hypatia.<br/><br/>"Thank you."<br/><br/>"Yeah, you owe me one. Hey, Chuckles," she says to Charleston, "tell me what the world is like. It's been...three thousand four hundred and...eight-six years since I was around."<br/><br/>"Let's see. It's the 1920s. Things are  booming. The economy cannot possibly go wrong..."<br/><br/>"How long is hair worn?"<br/><br/>"Shorter."<br/><br/>"I knew I left too soon."<br/><br/>Charleston waves his hands seven-dimensionally. Hypatia nods, staring at an image only she and Charleston can see.<br/><br/>"I mean, it all depends on what you want to be," says Charleston.<br/><br/>"I'm Hypatia. Haven't you seen my work?"<br/><br/>She waves her hands and the light comes up in the room. Behind her are mosaic portraits on the walls, of Nitocris, of Cleopatra, of Hypatia of Alexandria. All bear a strong resemblance to her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Together Hypatia and Charleston revive Freddie. A strange music begins to filter through the air.<br/><br/>"Where's that music coming from," says Freddie groggily.<br/><br/><i>[It was "In the Mood" by Glen Miller, actually, which makes is an anachronism--wasn't written until the 30s.]</i><br/><br/>"Down the hallway," says Hypatia.<br/><br/>"Are we correct in assuming that you're Nitocris."<br/><br/>"Yup. That was my first job, back when I went to Egypt. Just the bunch of us back then--me, Sir Aubrey, Roger...yeah. Roger, he was...well, he was something last time I saw him. Something else, that's for sure."<br/><br/>"Am I correct that you've lived an entire life?"<br/><br/>"A life?"<br/><br/>"Well, multiple lives."<br/><br/>"No, I just didn't stop living."<br/><br/>"How long will Shakhti be gone?"<br/><br/>"Not up to me, friend. Above my pay grade--that's up to the Dark Lord. He'll probably be a bit ticked--I think Jilly was off playbook here. He was probably told to bring me back, but he wanted to make sure he could order me around because he was--well, it's ungenteel to say what he was."<br/><br/>"So you work for the same person?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"You work for opposing interests?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"You work for different--"<br/><br/>"I don't work for anyone, honey. People work for me."<br/><br/>"Well, you say 'The Dark Lord' and the people we've met who say that usually are working for him--"<br/><br/>"Well, I mean we're <i>friends</i>. He was very good to me."<br/><br/>More music begins to play.<br/><br/><i>["Moonlight Serenade", another anachronism.]</i><br/><br/>"That's an interesting tune," says Freddie.

There is no sign of the room the were just in. People begin to mill around them, dressed in evening clothes.<br/><br/>A waiter crashes into Pearkes, spilling a tray of drinks on him. "I'm so sorry sir! Let me clean you up."<br/><br/>They go into a nearby men's room. "Let me just get a towel, sir," says the waiter. As he approaches, Pearkes stares at him shock: the waiter is his old attache, Sam Steele, murdered two months previously in New York.<br/><br/><i>[Stability check, obviously. I am not ashamed to say I stole part of this from "The Shining".]</i><br/><br/>"Been a while, Sam."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry, have we met?"<br/><br/>"What's your name?"<br/><br/>"Sam sir. Have you been here before? You look familiar."<br/><br/>"I think so. Maybe we'll meet again soon."<br/><br/>"Just keep coming to the club, sir. We can always use your patronage, Colonel."<br/><br/>"You should look into joining the Canadian Army. Military life probably becomes you."<br/><br/>"Oh, I'm not a military man, sir. I'm--I'm through with my fighting, sir."<br/><br/><br/><br/>George rejoins the rest in the main room of a bustling night club. Freddie can't place it--it looks familiar, but he can't tell if it's because he's been here before, or if it just looks like a standard New York nightclub.<br/><br/>They suddenly realize they are all dressed for evening. "What is this I am wearing?" says Noor.<br/><br/>"Come on, I'll teach you to dance," says Charleston.<br/><br/>An Asian man approaches Freddie. "This is a strange place," he says.<br/><br/>"It is."<br/><br/>"You are not speaking Mongolian."<br/><br/>"I'm going to guess that you are not speaking English."<br/><br/>"I am not. My name is Timur. Would you mind sitting down? I'm a bit lame."<br/><br/>"No, I think I'll be sitting way over here." Freddie strides away, and then realizes that he hasn't seen Hypatia since they entered the club. As he scans the crowd for her, he suddenly recognizes his aunts sitting at a table.<br/><br/>"Freddie!"<br/><br/>"Hullo, aunties."<br/><br/>"Roland. This is a most disreputable place."<br/><br/>"If you don't mind me asking, what in the blazes are you doing in a nightclub?"<br/><br/>"Just taking in the sights," says Dahlia.<br/><br/>"It was her idea," says Agatha.<br/><br/>"Let me rephrase then. What in blazes are you doing in a night club in a city in Arabia?"<br/><br/>"We're not in Arabia," says Dahlia. "It's complicated, Freddie. Anyway, the singer is about to arrive. This is a great moment for us all."<br/><br/>"That sounds rather ominous. Am I sitting with you?"<br/><br/>"If you wish. Dinner is about to be served."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Noor and Charleston are still on the dance floor when the music stops. "Ladies and gentlemen, the Arabian room is proud to present--our very special guest--you know him--you love him--NY! AR! LAT! HOOOOO-TEP!"<br/><br/>A man in a tux strides out on to the stage and takes the mike. "Imagine me and you..." he begins:\n<blockquote>I do...<br/>It's only right...<br/>To think about the world you want...<br/>and crush it tight...<br/>So happy together....</blockquote>\n"Hi folks, so great to see you all tonight. It's really going to be a wonderful evening. I've been looking forward to meeting some of you for so long--Adolf! Could you please stand up?"<br/><br/>A short man with a stubby mustache stands up. A spotlight catches him, leaving him looking uncomfortable.<br/><br/>"That guy--he is going to do some amazing things for us! Seriously, seriously. It's a night like this that reminds me that...\n<blockquote>I can't see me loving nobody but you, world...<br/>For all of Time...<br/></blockquote>\n"...because when we're together, oh baby, the Stars will be right!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>"You work for this man?" demands Freddie of Dahlia.<br/><br/>"Work for him? I should be so lucky! Oh, good, the dinner is here!"<br/><br/>A huge salver is placed on the table. The cover is lifted and the parboiled corpse of Jackson Elias is revealed.<br/><br/>"Do eat up, Freddie."<br/><br/>"Roland, for the love of God, don't do it," says Agatha. "You know I hate you as I hate few people. But you should not do this."<br/><br/>"Freddie," says Dahlia impatiently, "you must eat."<br/><br/><i>[OK. So I designed this part to go after some Pillars of Sanity, thus Pearkes and Sam, and now Freddie's core Pillar coming under assault.]</i><br/><br/>"Aunt Agatha, if I were to walk out of here where would I end up?"<br/><br/>"I don't know, but I don't think it would be someplace you'd want to be. But if I were you, I'd run away from us as fast as possible."<br/><br/>"Cheerio."<br/><br/>Freddie leaps up, vaults a railing, and slides out the secret entrance to the speakeasy...<br/><br/><br/>Pearkes sees Freddie run out. He starts to follow him when he is spun around by someone putting his arm around his shoulders. "Hey, Pearkesie! Call me N. I understand you have a thing for initials. Let's talk, you and me."<br/><br/>"Nyarla--"<br/><br/>"Hey, hey! Just N. No need to get all formal. Take a look at this."<br/><br/>N waves languidly at a map of the world carved in bas relief high on one wall. Five uncut rubies dot areas around the Indian ocean. "Isn't that beautiful?"<br/><br/>"As long as the British flag waves over it--"<br/><br/>"You are such an amusing little insect! I see why they keep you around. Listen, you want to find out about the Carlyles. Let me tell you about the Carlyles, let me show you what happened to the Carlyles."<br/><br/>A screen unfolds and a color moving image begins to play on it. Before Pearkes can react to the novelty of color images, he is shocked by the scenes of horror that unfold. The Carlyle expeditions, all its members easily recognizable, are moving through the bush in Africa. Nightmare monsters descend upon them. A five-headed horror shreds each of them horribly.<br/><br/>"So," says N. "What you should do is stop. You think you can stop? I hear," he whispers, "that you're good at taking orders."<br/><br/>"I don't take orders from the likes of you."<br/><br/>"Oh. Well, okay then. You're free to go. Go on. Right through that door."<br/><br/>Pearkes walks over to the exit, turns, and gives a salute with his sword. He steps through the door...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416440/#Comment_416440" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T20:29:31+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  8:29PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: You Know Who I Am (Part 15)</b><br/><br/>Charleston and Noor are still dancing when suddenly the singer appears next to them.

What would you like to do. Give me one thing you'd like to do. Anything at all. I'll give you the power to do it. One-time offer, no strings attached."<br/><br/>"I decline."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry, what?"<br/><br/>"I respectfully decline."<br/><br/>"Wait, I thought I just heard you say no."<br/><br/>"It's the most chaotic choice."<br/><br/>"Oh, man, you have to work for me!

There came a point where they stopped saying my name when they did their little rituals and cast their little spells.<br/><br/>"Me! I'm the guy who talks to Azathoth. I'm the Conduit! People don't do s*** unless they say my name. So I picked up that city and shoved it into another dimension.<br/><br/>"And you know what he did? The Great Squid?

It seems to be winter, and he shivers inside his thin evening clothes. He looks around.<br/><br/>London seems to have been bombed. Houses and apartment buildings lie shattered in the street.<br/><br/><i>[In my Pathfinder game, towards the end the PCs managed to end up vanishing for 20 years, so immediately the group assumed I had done the same here.]</i><br/><br/>A man passes by. "Look at you! You look quite the toff! Is this fancy dress?"<br/><br/>"Um, yes, it was."<br/><br/>"I didn't hear anything about that on the televisor. Is this a party thing? Because I don't like to get mixed up in party things. In fact, I think you're dangerous to my health, and I'll be going along."<br/><br/>"Now, now, my good man," says Freddie. "No need to worry."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance use by Freddie.]</i><br/><br/>"You've got a weird accent," says the man.<br/><br/>"I'm from a different part of England."<br/><br/>"England?"<br/><br/>"This is London, isn't it?"<br/><br/>"Of course it is! Capital of Airstrip One!"<br/><br/>"I'm from a different part of Airstrip One. You wouldn't happen to have the paper, would you? Was on a bit of a bender last night..."<br/><br/>"No, I don't go for the papers."<br/><br/>"Where could I get one?"<br/><br/>"At the party store, I guess, if you're in the party. Down on Chatham Square."<br/><br/>Freddie follows his directions and reaches a part of London that has been rebuilt, it seems, but in some horrible utilitarian style. As he walks, he sees banners hanging over the street:\n<blockquote>WAR IS PEACE<br/>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY<br/>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</blockquote>\nA large person in a black uniform checks Freddie into a wall with his truncheon. "What are you wearin'?"<br/><br/>"Party clothes."<br/><br/>"That's not party clothes. That's thoughtcrime I see. That's crimewear I see. Think I'll take you down bout the Ministry."<br/><br/>"Who do you think you are! What's your rank?"<br/><br/><i>[Bureaucracy buy by FP.]</i><br/><br/>"Constable."<br/><br/>"Well, if you don't want to go back to scrubbing toilets, you'll take your hands off of me."<br/><br/>"I think we should go and see my sergeant."<br/><br/>"I think we <i>both</i> should go see your sergeant."<br/><br/>"Lead the way, <i>sir</i>," says the constable, jabbing Freddie in the back with his truncheon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pearkes steps out of the door...<br/><br/>...and lands in the ocean.<br/><br/>Seconds later, a ship explodes behind him. Wooden splinters rain down around him, and he blacks out.<br/><br/>When he comes to, night has fallen. He is clutching a plank, all alone on the ocean. Looking at the stars, he guesses he is near the equator.<br/><br/>Far away, he hears the sound of a violin, and as the waves lift him up, he makes out some lights. He begins to swim towards it.<br/><br/>The ship proves to be a square-rigged frigate of some kind, flying a naval ensign that he dates to the Napoleonic wars.<br/><br/>A sailor on the deck of the ship catches sight of Pearkes. "Man overboard!" he shouts.<br/><br/>The music stops, and the door to the great cabin opens. A tall, heavyset blond man steps out, strips off his shoes, and dives into the water. In a few powerful strokes he is next to Pearkes, whom he drags to the side of the ship and helps up on to the deck.<br/><br/>"Sorry about that," he says as Pearkes flops to the deck. He holds out his hand. "Jack Aubrey."<br/><br/>"George Pearkes. I'm an officer in His Majesty's army."<br/><br/>"Really! Well, sir, welcome to His Majesty's Ship <i>Surprise</i>. You look a bit rough, if you'll pardon me. Send for Doctor Maturin!" he shouts at a sailor.<br/><br/>"I see you took care of a friend earlier," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"Too bad we couldn't take her as a prize," says Aubrey, leading him into the cabin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Charleston and Noor step through the door...<br/><br/>...and onto a street in a city. They are on a high hill, and have an excellent view of a beautiful bay. Sunlight sparkles off of it. In the distance, they can see a long suspension bridge, painted an unusual red color.<br/><br/>A man bumps into Charleston. "Oh, I'm sorry, so sorry, I didn't mean...oh. You're Chinese."<br/><br/>"What of it?"<br/><br/>"Hey, back off. I don't have to take anything from a [racial slur]. Get lost before I report you to the Kempeitai."<br/><br/>"What the hell is that?  Some Japanese word?"<br/><br/>"Whatever. Why don't you go run a rickshaw?"<br/><br/>As if on cue, a few rickshaws come dashing down the street.<br/><br/>"Where are we, Charleston? This doesn't look like any city I know."<br/><br/>"Let's find out." They walk up to a newsstand. A Chinese man regards them listlessly from inside the kiosk.<br/><br/>"Pardon me, sir. Konnichiwa--"<br/><br/>"Don't worry, man, I'm Chinese too," says the man in Chinese.<br/><br/>"Can I pay for a paper with one these?" says Charleston, slapping down a 1924 penny.<br/><br/>"If you give me another nine."<br/><br/>"<i>Ten cents</i> for a newspaper?"<br/><br/>"What can I tell you? It's the economy. Hard for an honset [racial slur] to find work."<br/><br/>Charleston looks at the front page:<br/><br/>April 4, 1962<br/><br/>GERMAN CHANCELLOR BORMANN REPORTED CRITICALLY ILL<br/>President of Pacific States of America to Meet German Ambassador<br/><br/>"Hey, you new in town?" asks the newsseller. "Your accent is weird--doesn't sound like you're just in from the mainland, but you look new."<br/><br/>"Yeah, well its hard out here."<br/><br/>"Don't have to tell me, man. I thought it was bad back home, that's why I came to the Pacific States, but its the same everywhere, the [racial slur for Japanese people] run everything. I guess it's better than being in the Eastern states--they have to deal with the Germans. Hey, is your friend Arabian?"<br/><br/>"Sort of."<br/><br/>"Didn't think there were many of those left. Anyway, if you need a place, why don't you stay at my cousin Wu's? He owns a boarding house, has a female dorm too for your friend."<br/><br/><i>[And somewhere, in some other plane, the laughter of the Dark Lord rains down on them...<br/><br/>This was the end of the session, and an interesting pickle.

Let's just say that the passive baby incubator version of Hypatia wasn't really to my taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416477/#Comment_416477" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T08:57:04+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  8:57AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, that annoyed me -- to be fair, as written, Roger Carlyle is also a shattered non-entity. But, I mean, Hypatia's not even interestingly insane as a baby incubator. She's just a sack. An alternative would have been having her active, determined to defend her unborn child against all comers, including pesky investigators. But, I like her having been Nitocris and Cleopatra. Does she have the dies-but-gets-brought-back deal that Shakti has?<br/><br/>I like what you did with N. It's much more interesting than the pyramid scene as written, especially as, while it makes sense to be utterly brutal and have him kill anyone dumb enough to sit in his throne, as written, this is problematic in actual play. In your game, I'd put money on it being Freddie sitting in the throne, and bumping him off for that breaks the tone you're going for. I mean, yes, things can get much darker and likely will, but that's a line you can't uncross. If not Freddie, I'd guess Charleston, but bumping him off for that would be boring. Showing him sanity blasting visions would be much more fun, but he's already doing that to himself. I suppose you could have an NPC like Alphonse in the hot seat, but again, it's a sudden shift in tone.<br/><br/>I look forward to the analysis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416480/#Comment_416480" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T09:40:07+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  9:40AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa,<br/><br/>Thanks! I have some interesting plans for Roger as well. As for N, well, I have a thing for trying to play deities with a sense of jokey menace. I mean, the Big N is so vast and incomprehensible, just showing up and doing a powers test isn't that big a deal or even that frightening. (And it practice, it tends to make players even more belligerent.) But making an extradimensional nightclub? That allows the PCs to access him on terms they sort of understand, and lets him get to them insidiously.<br/><br/>You're dead on about the tone. If the overall shape of this reboot owes a lot to Ronald Moore's <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> reboot, it's getting pretty clear that the tone of the campaign owes a lot to Joss Whedon. That is, smart, jokey, very capable heroes who shrug off most of the horror around them--but every now and then get hit by stuff that even makes them scared. So I have basically invented <i>Buffystar Galactica</i>, which come to think of it is a game I would play. Play so hard :-)<br/><br/>More anon...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416484/#Comment_416484" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T10:03:43+00:00" title="June 17, 2013 10:03AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and about Hypatia: I'm not really sure, but I think she just picked up the secret of immortality somewhere and has been just living on and on. At least some of the time she uses the Great Race ability to swap minds with people, but she also just flits from time to time. She's been hiding out in Irem for a while now, using the Great Race spell to check on the world, but mostly hiding from Shakhti/Gilgamesh. (This was part of her taunt to "Jilly" under the Sphinx; he thought she used the Great Race spell exclusively, and thus could resurrect her from her body; she just never stopped using her body.)<br/><br/>Inasmuch as I think about it, Shakhti's plan was to resurrect her in such a way as would allow him to control her. In this he seems to have been, as Hypatia put it, "off-playbook" and working his own schemes; the Dark Lord certainly wants Hypatia back for the conclusion of his great scheme, but that didn't include her being the puppet of his second-favorite servant. Hypatia must have figured that Shakhti would eventually try something like this, which is why she left the mummified Dimensional Shambler for him to find, along with some artifacts to make sure she could gloat when he did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416487/#Comment_416487" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T11:58:42+00:00" title="June 17, 2013 11:58AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was a mummified Dimensional Shambler?

I checked my notes, and I have an entry saying to use Hypatia as Nitocris from back in November. As I said above, the Hypatia-as-incubator thing is my least favorite part of Masks, so it's not any surprise that changing her fate was one of my earliest ideas.<br/><br/>Having made that decision, I now found myself with another problem: assuming I wanted to keep the Nitocris Resurrection plotline, how was that going to work? I toyed around with the idea of having her just get resurrected as per the original, but by this point I was already beginning to move stuff around and had begun to plan to have Irem be part of the Cairo section. The Arabian Nights bit about a mummified queen worked perfectly for this, so I decided to have Hypatia show up there.<br/><br/>But then what the hell was in the sarcophagus? It took me about two months to figure that one out; it wasn't until very close to the beginning of the campaign that I finally hit on the idea that Hypatia left a trap for people who wanted to try and bring her back. Given that I'd already established in my notes that Shakhti and M'Weru didn't get along, it didn't seem much of a stretch that Hypatia would also be uncharitable towards Omar. Somewhere along the line I decided that she would leave the mummy of a Dimensional Shambler inside her sarcophagus, and that Broadmoor would channel her mockery of Shakhti during the ritual. It was great, if railroady, theater.<br/><br/>(There are hints in the resurrection scene of just what the mummy is--it consistently teleported away from attempts to throw it or immobilize it.)<br/><br/>In my retelling, Hypatia is a bit of a free agent. She's not going to take over the leadership of the cult like Nitocris is supposed to do in the canon Masks. She clearly quit the Big N's project a long time ago, but she wouldn't be around if she hadn't figured out a way placate him. (Nyarlathotep has another mother for his child; I haven't cut that bit, just mixed it up some.) I pretty much planned to have her be a potential ally of the PCs, if not a very reliable one (or one particularly interested in helping them all the time.)<br/><br/>While the rather fudgey nature of the fight with Shakhti offends me, in retrospect (in addition to freeing him from Hetep and kicking him the sword, Hypatia transferred four points of Pearkes' Stability to Health--I feel bad about that one), with a bit of perspective it makes a lot of sense for Hypatia to help the PCs there. They're her catspaws; she uses them to get rid of Shakhti, whom she hates, without it being the case that she took out one of the Dark Lord's minions on her own.<br/><br/>That brings us to Nyarlathotep, and the encounter in the nightclub. I knew I wanted to do something different with that encounter, especially since I suspected I would move it. (In fact, I planned to have it available in any of the locations, depending on where the PCs went. It actually occurred slightly earlier than I wanted, but seemed to fit organically--in any case, Irem was always the best place for it.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how I settled on the nightclub act; it's not in my notes, so it may be a fairly old idea, although I kept refining it. The plan to attack the PCs' Pillars of Sanity was a very recent idea--I didn't come up with it until after episode IV. Nyarlathotep's song was a direct result of me messing around with "Happy Together" during my piano lessons; I realized that with a few word changes it would make a goofy/creepy theme song for the Big N's appearance. (I also toyed with the idea of having a cleaning woman show up at the end of the show and prove to be the <i>real</i> Nyarlathotep, but it didn't work out that way in play; but I'm keeping that one in my pocket.)<br/><br/>Okay, okay: Nyarlathotep as a lounge singer isn't exactly cosmic horror. I don't think it was exactly comic relief, though; I tried to keep up the subtle sense of menace throughout his appearance. (I couldn't transcribe it, but I made him talk in a kind of run-on manner, with his sentences following so fast they almost overlapped; that and a lot of changes to dynamics gave him what I hoped was a kinda supervillain demeanor.) I'm hoping that in some way the PCs pick up that N is so powerful, so confident, that he can even afford to look a bit silly--just don't laugh to his face.<br/><br/>The idea of pushing the PCs into fiction had its germ in a very old idea that got refined over time and didn't take its final form until the campaign started. I had toyed early on with the idea of the PCs not getting sent back just to Egypt, but other times; Pearkes seemed a natural to go back to Napoleonic days. While the ground rules of the campaign's fictional world were still in flux, I thought about making the events of the Aubriad actual history. Somewhere along the line I decided that it would be more interesting to have the worlds N could put the PCs be <i>fictional</i> even in the campaign's world. This eventually led to the idea of each PC (possibly Freddie and Gilbert as a unit) going to their own world.<br/><br/>The Aubriad was the first one I came up with; not sure when the meeting with Pearkes takes place, but probably either after <i>HMS Surprise</i> or <i>The Wine-Dark Sea</i>. Not sure when I settled on <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>, but it seemed natural to shove FP's toff into the crapsack dystopia.  <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> was the last one, chosen mostly because I re-read it for a book club. But in fact it has a lot going for it (I mean, in my game, not just as a novel!) as the whole reality vs fiction motif and the ultimate derivation of <i>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</i> let me play with metafiction on a grand scale.<br/><br/>In terms of Lovecraft's fiction, the book-worlds are manifestations of the Dreamlands--although they may also represent possible futures/pasts for the campaign world.<br/><br/>In terms of how I ran the session, I think it was a bit too railroaded. I'm glad I got the bangs in and fun was had, but I was clearly running the circus. I'm going to try and cycle back a bit on that now; I've got the biggest bits of my reboot mythos in play now, and I'm hoping the temptation to be such a "Classic GM" will abate. Also, I talk it out here, and I'm my own worst critic, so I think things will look up now :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416594/#Comment_416594" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T13:10:43+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  1:10PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I missed the teleporting bit -- I need to reread that.

FP gets it the most, as I've noted, and GPs lack of experience helps him get more in the spirit, I think.<br/><br/>I have no idea what Hypatia did. Must have been something, right? If this comes out at all, it will come out in play &amp; I hope the players have a hand in creating the explanation. I'm going to stick with the "we're just friends" explanation for now--if the group meets Hypatia again (they probably will), they can ask her--just make sure to know who the session players are in her band, as the Big N may occasionally drop by for a set...<br/><br/>I didn't see any reason not to make the nightclub a movable feast. Encountering the Big N should just <i>happen</i>. There's absolutely no good reason to hold that encounter back from the PCs, nor is there any reason why Nyarlathotep should be limited by pesky things like the space-time continuum. (I have some ideas on what N is, or at least what he <i>says</i> he is, that may come out in the next session, which is theoretically this Saturday.) My general feeling in this campaign is that I'm going to try and give them all the content possible.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416621/#Comment_416621" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T20:58:53+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  8:58PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, once you point it out, it's obvious that it should be a moveable feast and that, dramatically, the PCs should absolutely meet him.

Ton of good stuff, but sadly I've broken too many things to make much use. The Shanghai stuff will probably be okay. It's interesting to see just how tied to simulation CoC tries to be. I am quite comfortable that I didn't end up running this campaign with it.<br/><br/>Still in negotiations, but I'm pretty sure I'll be running the next session on Saturday. I finally found the title: "The Windmills of Your Mind." I was going to go with something book-themed--I had tentatively decided to look at "My Back Pages." However, last week I decided, as I do sometimes, to use Spotify to acquaint myself with artists I remain shockingly unexposed to; this time it was Dusty Springfield. Her rendition of this-trippy-even-for-Michel-Legrand ballad is so amazing that I knew I'd found the theme for the next session.<br/><br/>So it's interesting--I mentioned that when I choose a title, it tends to influence my thinking about the next installment. Certainly I'm now thinking along the lines of lost love, and surreal dream imagery. Which I was headed for anyway, but it does focus the mind some.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416748/#Comment_416748" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T19:49:45+00:00" title="June 20, 2013  7:49PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think through writing, with pen and paper.

Generally, for any game, I let my brain kick out what I think might be cool scenes. I try hard not to think how they'll play out, just things that make the scene interesting: a location, a situation, a confrontation. If I'm on my game, I subconsciously frame them a bit like Robin Laws does in DramaSystem: get a grasp on the conflict, who's the petitioner and who's the granter.<br/><br/>In the Pathfinder game, I had two steps at this point: first, I would do a wireframe of "nodes" (see Justin Alexander's very interesting "three clue" rule &amp; <a href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach" rel="nofollow">node based design</a>), with the connections between each scene plotted out. I usually just did a basic key, writing down a quick summary of the clues and where they led to.<br/><br/>Then I would plan the encounters. This took the most time, partly because I could never efficiently read the Paizo monster stat blocks. I ended up grabbing a spreadsheet from the SRD site and built a Word merge document that put everything in a place where I could read it. (I also blocked out hit points in groups of 5, so I could just cross off boxes &amp; not do much math.) Beyond the formatting, setting up balanced encounters was always a pain in the butt, even with me reskinning monsters frequently.<br/><br/>For the Masks campaign, I don't usually bother with doing wireframes, as the campaign book already has done most of that kind of work. I sometimes make a few brief notes on the major NPCs for that session, and jot down some ideas for extra scenes--for example, the raid on the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in the last session. (I had actually prepped the three vampires for Session IV, but they never came in play.) I tend to run things on the fly anyway, so I can get away with a low amount of prep. (And since I record the sessions now, I'm not likely to forget stuff later.)<br/><br/>The musical "inspiration" I sort of blundered into operates on a very subconscious level, but it is in there somewhere; I'm kind of interested to see if it will play out in this session, given how I've been obsessed with the title song for a while now, and that I'm actually conscious of trying to use it as inspiration.<br/><br/>I'm actually trying to do a "credit sequence" for this session; if I manage to finish it, I'll see if I can find a way to post it here. (I also owe you guys some clips of the sessions themselves; again, it's finding a place to host it that's the main issue right now.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416850/#Comment_416850" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-22T21:21:27+00:00" title="June 22, 2013  9:21PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Didn't finish the credit sequence, but if I get a tiny bit of time I'll try to (I'm off on Wednesday for my Four Capitals whirlwind tour of Europe.)<br/><br/>We didn't have GP, so my thought that Gilbert would jump through the various novels didn't come to pass.

And Jack Brady makes a passable PC :-) <br/><br/>I do have a couple of people from the Tuesday group I'm in who might make a good match.<br/><br/>We had another one interesting incident, and since the writeup will be piecemeal, I'll discuss it briefly here:<br/><br/>The PCs get in to meet Edouard Gavigan, the head of Fondation Aubrey Penhew, the Paris-headquartered charitable foundation created by Penhew's estate. They make some inquiries. FP mentions that he's talked to Hypatia, but Gavigan seems unflappable. (As will be revealed, his suave exterior belies a pretty tough inner core.) They mention Jackson Elias, and he flinches a bit but says he barely remembers talking to her.<br/><br/>Having run out of threads, FP suggests that PP use Interrogation. I point out that for Interrogation to work, you need to at least convince the target that he is in your power. I also mention that he can tell there's some kind of way through the closets in Gavigan's office to a room beyond--he can see the light coming in.<br/><br/>So Pearkes locks the door, draws his gun, and demands that Gavigan answer some questions.<br/><br/>Gavigan very obviously presses a hidden button on his desk and smoothly says that the interview is over.<br/><br/>Pearkes punches him, Charleston secures him, and they go into the storage room next door. Gavigan tells them that everyone in the Expedition is dead except possibly Brady, and that Elias was insane. Then the police arrive and arrest the PCs.<br/><br/>I am of a couple of minds about this and how I handled it.<br/><br/>From a purely narrative/fictional stance, I don't think I was all that unreasonable. Gavigan is a hard nut to crack, and pulling a gun in his own sanctum isn't going to scare him or let him think that he's in somebody else's power--all he has to do is hold out for a little while, and the law and his own servants will arrive to help him.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Pearkes has the skill, and interrogation is a bit difficult to use in a lot of situations. Plus, there are plenty of examples in fiction where this kind of thing can work.<br/><br/>I'm just not 100% convinced this was one of them. Against a lesser target, it might well have worked.<br/><br/>But on the gripping hand, am I being too hard on the players? This is one of those fine line questions.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that what keeps getting me is that there seems to be an expectation that the PCs can act like this and then resume normal life, even though I telegraphed in the New York chapter that naked violence would have consequences, if precautions weren't taken. Had they grabbed Gavigan off the street &amp; then spirited him away somewhere, I'd have been happy to let it work. But threatening a guy who regularly has dinner at the Elysee Palace, in his office, in broad daylight? When the guy in question has a very shady past and is extremely well-connected? I dunno.<br/><br/>I'll probably give them some leads from this, so that I didn't nerf the skill, and FP &amp; PP made some buys (Credit Rating from FP to find a suitably-connected <i>avocat</i> and then Bargain from PP to pay the exorbitant civil settlement that resulted) that will allow the heat to die down somewhat. But it was still a tough situation and I'm ambivalent about my response--but also about what to do with the inevitable future recurrences of this situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417041/#Comment_417041" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T19:22:11+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  7:22PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So a couple of things before I begin the writeup.<br/><br/>I had one of those fridge moments just now. I was near the fridge, but not actually using it. Anyway.<br/><br/>I've been striving, with spotty success, to change up how I run games. To be less railroady in general, to allow more narrative control. To that end, I prepped practically nothing for the session. I had a couple of cool "this might be an interesting element" scenes in mind, but I told my players that I was interested in seeing how they got out of their situations, and I meant it; I honestly didn't know.<br/><br/>In practice, however, there was a lot of deus ex machina. Now, given that there's an actual deus involved, maybe that's not unexpected. But still.<br/><br/>The other thing that happened is that I made a hard, threatening move against one PC. I think it was justified in the fiction. In practice, it channeled him towards a choice (the next destination) that I was happy with. So: did I railroad? Is there a difference between a hard move and railroading in this case? (Yes, I know the common distinction between hard &amp; soft moves, plus I just ordered Vincent's pdf package to read on my trip, so I'll have an even better idea shortly.)<br/><br/>If you give a player a shove, without taking away their ability to move or not move, and they move (because you shoved them), did you rob them of agency? Or are they harmonizing with the fiction?<br/><br/>I honestly don't know. So I'll try to write it up and see what you guys think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417046/#Comment_417046" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T19:39:24+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  7:39PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: The Windmills of Your Mind (Prelude)</b><br/><br/><i>December, 1947</i><br/><br/><i>[This was a scene that played out between me and FP.

So it goes.]</i><br/><br/>Waves pound the shores of Jura, in the Hebrides. The day dawns with sunlight filtering through a ragged sky, and cold winds lash the moors.<br/><br/>In a small cottage, a large, bustling housekeeper enters a darkened room. She opens some blinds, revealing a man sleeping in a tousled bed. The sunlight illuminates a large typewriter.<br/><br/>"Guid morning, sir.

He gestures to some constables, and they shove Freddie into a chair. Freddie leans back, relaxing.<br/><br/>The clerk goes into a back room. Glancing around, Freddie notices that people are staring at him. One young clerk nearby picks up the phone and seems to be in an animated conversation with someone. Freddie tries to read his lips:<br/><br/>"No, he doesn't...yes, he does...No, he isn't...I'm not sure. Younger." <br/><br/>Then the clerk gets up and leaves.<br/><br/>Freddie takes out a notepad and begins writing.

How do you explain your reaction to it?"<br/><br/>David Warner nods at the Thought Police thugs. They pull Freddie out of the chair. At that moment, two more constables walk in.

If you're allowing a spend, it must be effective. Otherwise, don't allow the spend. If you're allowing the roll, make sure everyone is clear about what success and failure mean. If what the players want from a success is not something you are prepared to permit, don't allow the roll.<br/><br/>This may mean slowing down and saying, "Okay, wait. What do you want to happen?" Then, once you have the details, figure out whether you're good with that or not. If not, "No, that won't happen because [insert explanation, perhaps countersuggestion]." If so, "Okay, and this is what a failure means." Right now, in my arrogant opinion, you need to slow down because communication is not 5 by 5 here, and I think you're both frustrating each other.<br/><br/>Another thing to keep an eye out for is the X-Y problem. That is, if the player wants to do X to get Y outcome -- e.g., threaten Gavigan to learn where the next ritual will take place (or whatever), don't focus on threatening Gavigan, on what it will do, on why it will or won't work. Look at Y. What does the player hope to get? This will help you countersuggest if the player's way off base.<br/><br/>But, complicating this, there's a part of Y that you're hearing, correctly, I think, and that complicates things. It isn't just "I want information on where the ritual is" -- it's that AND "I want to look cool doing it and get a bit of spotlight". And that's part of where you're feeling conflicted. You want to make the PCs look cool, but not at the expense of your suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>And you may need to give on the suspension of disbelief. You may need to go a little more pulp. I can't tell. If this is a matter of communication and matching expectations, it's entirely likely that you guys can find a good balance. You might be able to do more of "Okay, you're a policeman / you're Gavigan, and the NPC does what you just did. Honestly, now -- what follows?"<br/><br/>But, it may be that you're stuck too much on what you think should happen. I can't tell. I can tell that I am seeing this as a pattern in what you've been saying (roughly, "I feel bad about the decision I made, but that seemed to be the only logical decision that didn't negate the way the world works"), but you're venting, you're analyzing and critiquing yourself, and, most importantly, you were there and I was not. I've played with honest, well meaning players who simply push for as much as they can get away with, with absolutely no malice -- but also no understanding of the genre conventions a game's dealing with (and I'm including various modes of realism as genre conventions).<br/><br/>Fr'ex, I ran one scenario where the PCs had essentially won the day, convincing some serpentfolk that it was possible to coexist with humanity without needing to crush or cow it. (This is my Kerberos Fate game, and not any flavor of Cthulhu gaming.) So far, so fine. Then, one player tried to convince the serpentfolk that he was a Secret Serpentfolk Operative (he could shapechange) and got increasingly frustrated as he failed to have them eating out of his hand.<br/><br/>He eventually decided that his character had been trying to outclever himself, something entirely in character, and we wrapped things up with a happy resolution. But, there was definitely a communications issue.<br/><br/>First, he wasn't aware that one particular event was now unstoppable. This had been in the control of another player's PC, and his PC never had the option to interfere directly. This was not clear to the player, and it was so clear to the rest of us that we utterly failed to understand he didn't realize it.<br/><br/>Second, he was making some giant assumptions about serpentfolk culture with no data. And I was saying over and over to myself, "Why does he think that's the way they work? It isn't." (It would have helped if I'd said that out loud, as players cannot be expected to read minds.)<br/><br/>Am I throwing my weight around deciding "Nope, that's just how the world works, and you can't convince the serpentfolk you're a secret intelligence operative, because they didn't have anyone in that role who'd be acting the way you're having your character act"? Is he being unreasonable expecting that he can get sentient beings he'd never encountered before to follow his lead without question merely because his shapechange skill no longer requires that he study a target before taking its shape? (Comes right out of the rules for Kerberos Fate, plain as day.) Do I tell him to roll the dice again and set an absurdly high target number?<br/><br/>Ideally, I would have stopped him and said, "Okay, first of all, you can't stop what's going on. Second, you don't have to. Third, you don't know enough about their culture to take over. Fourth, you don't have to -- you guys have won."<br/><br/>There's an additional factor in this case. Gavigan's one of those smart villains that can be a real pain for GMs. Play him too effectively, and the players don't have a chance. Have him make mistakes, and you run the risk of him feeling too dumb. It can be tricky to find a middle ground.<br/><br/>But, it's not impossible. First, playing Trail of Cthulhu means the PCs will find the core clues they need. Okay. What are those clues? How can they find them? Forget diaries and intimidating one particular person. Clues = Bits of Information. What do they need? Once you know that, the actual information can be planted wherever you need it to be.<br/><br/>Second, Gavigan can make mistakes. If I recall his backstory, he's a self-made man who started off poor and resents folks who were born with a silver spoon in their mouth. One of them's just annoyed him, right? Freddy has Bad Luck. So, he can try to sic thugs or monsters on the group in such a way that can give Pearkes a chance to fight them, correct?<br/><br/>And what kind of boss is he? What kind of cultist leader? Might there be a disgruntled employee who wants to help the PCs take Gavigan down a peg, and willing to supply information, not realizing how dangerous this is? Might there be a cultist who wants to take Gavigan's place? If so, that's someone who can be dumb enough to make all the mistakes Gavigan would never make.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417066/#Comment_417066" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T00:17:08+00:00" title="June 25, 2013 12:17AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've been striving, with spotty success, to change up how I run games. To be less railroady in general, to allow more narrative control. To that end, I prepped practically nothing for the session. I had a couple of cool "this might be an interesting element" scenes in mind, but I told my players that I was interested in seeing how they got out of their situations, and I meant it; I honestly didn't know.<br/><br/>In practice, however, there was a lot of deus ex machina. Now, given that there's an actual deus involved, maybe that's not unexpected. But still.</blockquote>\nFor me, prepping helps me roll with it when the players drive the plot off the rails. And, for me, overprepping slightly is better than underprepping. But, YMMV.\n<blockquote>The other thing that happened is that I made a hard, threatening move against one PC. I think it was justified in the fiction. In practice, it channeled him towards a choice (the next destination) that I was happy with. So: did I railroad? Is there a difference between a hard move and railroading in this case? (Yes, I know the common distinction between hard &amp; soft moves, plus I just ordered Vincent's pdf package to read on my trip, so I'll have an even better idea shortly.)<br/><br/>If you give a player a shove, without taking away their ability to move or not move, and they move (because you shoved them), did you rob them of agency? Or are they harmonizing with the fiction?<br/><br/>I honestly don't know. So I'll try to write it up and see what you guys think.</blockquote>\nStill haven't read the write ups, so the particulars may change my opinion, but I think shoving is like a Magician's Choice -- there's no real choice. Okay, that's not entirely true, but it sounds like it's definitely steering things. This may or may not be a problem.<br/><br/>I'm not sure Hard Moves is the way to think for CoC / ToC, although I'm not sure it isn't. But, also think Dogs in the Vineyard -- the information will come out. Your core clues must come out. Supplementary clues don't need to come out.<br/><br/>At this point, where you are right now, not where you were before the end of the most recent session, what are the PCs trying to do? What do they know? What do they need to know to keep the plot moving? This may be "nothing" -- we're talking "How do PCs find the plot?", not "How do PCs succeed in thwarting it?" -- but, complicating this, Masks may be less satisfying if the PCs don't ever find out what they should be doing.<br/><br/>What are player expectations? What are your expectations? Right now, how much of a clash between these two exists? For me, my PC burning all bridges to a normal life isn't a dealbreaker, but doing so to meet with only failure and frustration in thwarting the bad guys (as opposed to going out with a bang, a noble, but failing effort) probably would be. But, I wouldn't come up with a PC like Pearkes. I'm not sure what I would come up with for Masks, but Pearkes isn't my style.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417068/#Comment_417068" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T00:36:14+00:00" title="June 25, 2013 12:36AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I'm now caught up.

FP seems to know how to match expectations -- or how to convince you that his expectations really are compatible with yours, and it's hard to see whether they just are, whether he's charismatic, whether it's because he's playing a character good at social skills, rather than military skills, in a game of ancient and deadly conspiracies which seem more socially than physically vulnerable.<br/><br/>Again, I'm seeing through a glass darkly and enjoying the write ups.

I'm going to think about these things deeply. Also, I have Dogs and Apocalypse World in pdf form (Thanks, Vincent!) which will make good airport reading!<br/><br/>I may need to come back and forth to your points, but let's start with a few things.<br/><br/>First, on Gavigan: what they found out at the end of the session from Mickey Mahoney (in my reboot, the publisher of an Irish Nationalist paper and also pretty clearly an intelligence operative for the Irish Free State) is that Edouard Gavigan, the suave, well-connected graduate of the Ecole Diplomatique who dines twice a year with the President at the Elysee Palace, was actually born Eddie Gaffigan in Ireland--"Ulsterman, and a bad 'un" as Mahoney puts it. By 1915 he was a bomb-maker and assassin working for one of the militias that would form the Irish Republican Army; but in 1916 he was a member of a British Army unit commanded by Colonel Aubrey Penhew. During the Rising he seems to have betrayed a Republican patrol to the British, resulting in their massacre.<br/><br/>Sometime after that he suddenly appeared in his M. Gavigan persona, as Penhew's rising protege.<br/><br/>So clearly Gavigan is a pure survivor, ambitious as Satan and cold as a lizard. Mahoney tells the PCs that there have been at least three attempts, by operatives who knew what they were doing, to assassinate Gavigan; not only did all of them fail, but the ops were never heard from again. <br/><br/>This isn't the kind of guy who gets phased just because somebody sticks a gun in his face.<br/><br/>Now, I knew that but the PCs didn't. OTOH, I hadn't given them the results of the research yet--but that was intentional, as Gavigan wanted to meet them at an advantage. I simply didn't anticipate them going full-on aggro with him, mostly because what the hell?<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I played a lot of classic Traveller when I was a kid. Trav actually had rules (Law Level, official harassment) to deal with local police. In Traveller, if you're planning illegal activities, you always take the police into account. (And, you know, that's a genre convention as well. In the post-game period, I considered the pulp examples of coming into a guy's office and sticking a gun in his face; my sense is that it tends to work if its the minor guy, or the businessman in over his head, but if its the Big Bad, you do so with an expectation that the cops will eventually show up and you'll need an explanation; Chandler is rife with examples.)<br/><br/>But I think you're right. I'm getting caught up on "don't just deny an action, because that's nerfing player choice" without considering that not giving a PC full info is also nerfing choice. Tough, innit? I mean, I did tell them the requirements for Interrogation, but they interpreted that as "we need to lock the door" and I should have probably guided them away from it. (Really, the best thing to do would have been to say, "Guys, here's where you are: most of your interpersonal skills won't affect him at this point, until you have something on him; and by the way, he got slightly rattled when you mentioned Hypatia.")<br/><br/>So why didn't that happen? I have a few thoughts, but for your consideration, here's a pretty much verbatim transcription of the exchange in question; I've left in all the OOC speech, so you can see what was going on.<br/><br/>FP, to PP: You have Interrogation, why don't you ask some leading questions?<br/><br/>PP: Why, yes I will!<br/><br/>Me: Interrogation requires that the person at least believe he is in your power. [Note: that's not the actual rule; I bent it slightly to make it more useful!]<br/><br/>FP: You can't do a coffee shop interrogation, like in Cold War movies?<br/><br/>Me: No, that's other skills.<br/><br/>FP: Could we use Reassurance? Get him to drop some clues?<br/><br/>CP: Yeah, seems easier than trying to kidnap him.<br/><br/>PP: Where are we, in a coffee shop? ...<br/><br/><i>[Okay, break. Problem the first: PP had just driven home from Canada that day, and his fiancee had come home about an hour earlier; he was tired, it was late, and he had been taking care of some stuff as the game wound down. Human reaction: I was a bit annoyed he'd checked out. Humane reaction: I should have taken this more into account.</i><br/><br/>[at this point I describe the artifacts on Gavigan's desk and mention that there's a room beyond the closets.]<br/><br/>PP: I will stand up, move over to the door, and lock it. [to Gavigan] I think we should have a private conversation. Ask you a few questions.<br/><br/>Me, as Gavigan: [miming pressing a concealed button] I think that this interview is over.<br/><br/>PP: I think it's just begun.<br/><br/>CP: I reverse the chair under the door.<br/><br/>PP: I punch him.<br/><br/>FP, in character: Oh Good God!<br/><br/>Gavigan: <i>Aidez-moi, aidez-moi! Au secours!</i><br/><br/>[pounding on door]<br/><br/>CP: I got this. Do I have anything sharp on me?<br/><br/>PP: I don't need that. I pull my gun.<br/><br/>CP: That will be loud...<br/><br/>PP: I'm not going to pull the trigger, <b>I'm just going to intimidate him</b>.<br/><br/>Aieee, this is the first time I've <i>really</i> listened to the recording. That sure sticks out!<br/><br/>But maybe you can see how this escalated gradually, and it wasn't so easy for me to just step in. The proper time to do it was when PP declared he was going to hit Gavigan, although even then things hadn't really gotten to the point that he wouldn't have just let them go. It was ultimately pulling the gun and dragging him into the storeroom that did it, that and the police arriving.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll have more anon. I think the major issue for me is to slow down more. This is hard, since in Robin Laws' typology I'm a straight up Method Actor and I tend to get very caught up in the character I'm playing at the time, leaving me less room to step back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417103/#Comment_417103" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T06:51:21+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  6:51AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, another way of looking at this is that one player decided to grab the scene, and the other players fell in line supporting him--as, in fact, did I, by not cutting him off.<br/><br/>Which is to say: we allowed PP to make a choice, and then we all supported that choice, including me, with the notable proviso that my support of that action would (by nature of my role) include providing the consequences of that action.<br/><br/>I have to think about his more. I've never done improv (although I'm getting interested in maybe taking a little acting on the side) so I don't know what kind of a situation this is.

Pearkes was gathering material for a stretcher to carry Freddie back to town. He doesn't have Stealth, so I ruled (correctly, as it turns out) that he made enough noise to rouse the shop owner whose awning he was stealing. He tried to pay the guy off (and here's where <i>I</i> should have de-escalated) but the shopkeeper chose not to accept the Englishman's money. This spun out of control into a mob scene.<br/><br/>--Session Four did involve his plan to machine-gun the crowd at Shakhti's place, but that was just role-playing.<br/><br/>OTOH, channeled he can be fantastic; he wasn't that meta at all when confronted with "Constance", he's always had Pearkes demonstrate personal bravery. But there's some flaw in the social contract between us. He's constantly looking to escalate into dominance and intimidation, even in situations where logically that won't work. Actually, <i>especially</i> in situations where that won't work. The rest of us don't want to not support his choices, so we fall in line with what he does to the fiction; but that tends to leave me in the uncomfortable position of having to slap down the consequences.<br/><br/>There's also a playstyle mismatch going on at a personal level. I've played mean, even psychotically power-hungry characters. In fact, two of my favorite characters to play are a fire sorceress/con-artist, a street kid who longs for the ultimate power as a way to never get hurt again, and a combat-focused bard who specializes in interrogation and torture. Both are quick-witted, but both would definitely betray people if they needed to. (I temper this in actual play by having both of them be fairly loyal to the people they like.) But I have no illusions about either of them: they're <i>anti-heros</i>, and a bad end is almost certainly in the cards for them. And I'm okay with it! When I play the sorceress seriously, her story is that of a damaged person who could be either truly evil or truly repentant. (Probably evil.)<br/><br/>But then, I'm comfortable with--hell, demand--moral ambiguity in my playstyle.<br/><br/>PP is different. He likes moral <i>clarity</i>, and I think a big kick for him is to get situations via the game that he can't get in real life--clear cut right and wrong situations, or at least situations where he can solve them with a simple criterion. He also likes the chance to play characters who can act in dark/anti-heroic ways while holding themselves up as morally sound. (His paladins are always Lawful Intolerant.)<br/><br/>In fantasy games--well, in Pathfinder--this gets papered over because there actually <i>is</i> moral clarity available, via the alignment system, even if in practice my games tend to be a lot more ambiguous about right and wrong. (When I run d20 games, I ask the players to define what their alignment means to them, since just about any behavior is justifiable under just about any alignment.) But this game...this game is, you know, reaching for <i>postmodernity</i>, with a lot of relativism. The Big N isn't pure evil (he's beyond human morality, but even given that he isn't what you think he might be.) Some people have done terrible things for good reasons. Others have done good things for terrible reasons.<br/><br/>So it goes.<br/><br/>FP is content with this; he basically likes a world of rational actors, so morality is fluid for him. CP likes playing characters who sink into their own depravity, but don't tend to take anybody with them (in the Pathfinder game he played an incredibly abrasive goblin wizard--but then, his charisma was like 5, so well done.) <br/><br/>In terms of what you asked about FP seeming to get it more, I think that explains why, that and his enormous RPGing experience. Plus, given that he's a classic Tactician, he's totally content to use his narrative input to get his kick of routing around opposition; but since suspension of disbelief is important to him, he doesn't take it too far.<br/><br/>I'm venting (on the internet!) its true, and probably not in an interesting way, but sadly writing stuff down is my way to work through stuff. I'm going to post this because I am interested in your reactions...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417121/#Comment_417121" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T08:52:39+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  8:52AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Couple of other non-venty things.<br/><br/>I agree that slowing down, and focusing on outcome not action is going to help. Now, while I love the "to do it, you must do it" theory, Gumshoe isn't set up perfectly for that kind of thing because of the need to declare what ability you want to use.<br/><br/>The main problem, as I framed at considerable length above, is that in the gameplay as it exists now, this will require stopping the action and asking everyone to back up.<br/><br/>Now, point of fact Gumshoe can help here--because I can ask people what they want to do with the skill, and then guide them a bit, or let them know where they have complete narrative control.<br/><br/>If the scene had played out as PP asking, "I want to get more information. Can I use Interrogation?" then I would have prompted him about how that couldn't work because he couldn't get Gavigan in a place where he was under their control. <br/><br/>"Can I Intimidate him?"<br/><br/>"You don't think so, unless you can find some handle on him--he seems strangely unphased by your subtle hints of violence."<br/><br/>...Then we'd have some new information &amp; clues coming in. I could even have dropped a hint about Hypatia.

By 1915 he was a bomb-maker and assassin working for one of the militias that would form the Irish Republican Army; but in 1916 he was a member of a British Army unit commanded by Colonel Aubrey Penhew. During the Rising he seems to have betrayed a Republican patrol to the British, resulting in their massacre.</blockquote>\nThat is very cool. (A reporter PC I played in a pulp game would probably decide to call him Eddie, and would probably be made to regret that.)\n<blockquote>So clearly Gavigan is a pure survivor, ambitious as Satan and cold as a lizard. Mahoney tells the PCs that there have been at least three attempts, by operatives who knew what they were doing, to assassinate Gavigan; not only did all of them fail, but the ops were never heard from again. <br/><br/>This isn't the kind of guy who gets phased just because somebody sticks a gun in his face.</blockquote>\nThat doesn't necessarily follow. I mean, I'm fine with that being so for Gavigan, but it is not unreasonable to believe that even soldiers and assassins get nervous when there's a gun in their face. I could see PP thinking, "Okay, I have to control the environment and make him believe he's in my power? Well, what better way to do that than to put a gun to his head?"\n<blockquote>Now, I knew that but the PCs didn't. OTOH, I hadn't given them the results of the research yet--but that was intentional, as Gavigan wanted to meet them at an advantage. I simply didn't anticipate them going full-on aggro with him, mostly because what the hell?</blockquote>\nYah, this is clearly something you now know you need to factor in. I mean, even beyond the "Okay, players could go aggro, try to persuade, try to be sneaky...", as PP seems to turn to force a lot, even when the rest of the group doesn't.\n<blockquote>But I think you're right. I'm getting caught up on "don't just deny an action, because that's nerfing player choice" without considering that not giving a PC full info is also nerfing choice. </blockquote>\nYes, good point. And it can be really tricky to remember that what's obvious to you isn't to the players. That still trips me up.<br/><br/>Anyway, more later, and enjoy the vacation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417316/#Comment_417316" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T09:20:01+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  9:20AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(Really, the best thing to do would have been to say, "Guys, here's where you are: most of your interpersonal skills won't affect him at this point, until you have something on him; and by the way, he got slightly rattled when you mentioned Hypatia.")</blockquote>\nYah, you need that last, because otherwise, however well justified, the scenario is denying players the chance to be effective -- it's a tricky thing, because if all of the NPCs can be walked all over by the PCs, it isn't a satisfying scenario.\n<blockquote>FP, to PP: You have Interrogation, why don't you ask some leading questions?<br/><br/>PP: Why, yes I will!<br/><br/>Me: Interrogation requires that the person at least believe he is in your power. [Note: that's not the actual rule; I bent it slightly to make it more useful!]</blockquote>\nI'll need to look up the actual rule. I'm reading Eternal Lies, and there's a section where the author's distinguishing between "soft" and "hard" interrogation.\n<blockquote><br/><i>[Okay, break. Problem the first: PP had just driven home from Canada that day, and his fiancee had come home about an hour earlier; he was tired, it was late, and he had been taking care of some stuff as the game wound down. Human reaction: I was a bit annoyed he'd checked out. Humane reaction: I should have taken this more into account.</i><br/></blockquote>\nOver the years, I've come to realize that real life can be annoying that way. We game on weekends or after a long day at work and are often tired. Players forget even basic stuff, which is why I was doing "Last week on..." handouts before Buffy existed. I welcomed PCs with eidetic memory as it justified the players having constant access to the clues. But yes, it can be annoying. Heck, in a pbem, one of my best players stunned us all by totally forgetting that the email to which he was responding was discussing a potential ally, not a known villain -- confusing two NPCs when the one under discussion was named. (Me: Just checking -- you really want to kill off NPC X? Him: What? No! He's much too interesting -- oh, is that who we were talking about?) This boggled me, as it was a short email, but so it goes.\n<blockquote>[at this point I describe the artifacts on Gavigan's desk and mention that there's a room beyond the closets.]</blockquote>\nAnd PP probably heard that as a hint that that was the place to take Gavigan for an interrogation, I'm guessing.\n<blockquote>But maybe you can see how this escalated gradually, and it wasn't so easy for me to just step in.</blockquote>\nOh, absolutely!\n<blockquote>Anyway, I'll have more anon. I think the major issue for me is to slow down more. This is hard, since in Robin Laws' typology I'm a straight up Method Actor and I tend to get very caught up in the character I'm playing at the time, leaving me less room to step back.</blockquote>\nAnd it's something a GM has to be able to do. But, that never makes it easy. (Also, the setting is a GM's character, ad the same rules about stepping back apply, but that's a side point.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417320/#Comment_417320" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T09:55:41+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  9:55AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I have to think about his more.

Talking with FP, I think that I'll give Interrogation some other mechanical effects--the knowledge revealed is better and more focused, and will have lasting effects on the subject--he'll either fear or trust the interrogator.<br/><br/>To some degree, there's nothing to be done with Pearkes. PP is always going to go aggro on people. I'll  need to  prep for it (not so much for PP specifically, since he's a short-timer now, but in general.) Though to be honest, Gavigan's response would pretty much always be the same. Guy's a bomber and assassin, and crazy enough to betray the IRA. He clearly doesn't fear death; and he'd take comfort in knowing a lot of people would go with him. This aint the first time somebody's stuck a gun in his face, after all.<br/><br/>So what to take away? Plan for aggro--be ready to step back, and hand out clues as to consequences. (Though, again, the guy presses a secret button on his desk--what did PP think was happening there?) Also, I'm going to try next session to get the players to be more objective-oriented: don't tell me what you do, tell me what you want, let's pick a skill, and then narrate. A bit clumsier at first, but it avoids a lot of problems. (I'm also going to communicate to the players in stronger terms that this isn't Pathfinder; they gain nothing by trying to fool me or pull one off against me; I'm not in opposition!)<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my thoughts for now...I'm beat (museums don't tour themselves, and are sometimes inconveniently far from each other!)

"Your wounds are most interesting," he says, pulling an inch-long wooden splinter out of Pearkes' cheek. "You have been beaten, thrown against something with great force, and recently strangled. I find myself very curious about your injuries. Especially the strangulation."<br/><br/>"A French chap tried to do something to me, but I soon put him right."<br/><br/>Maturin shakes his head, and Pearkes has the strange feeling that he can tell he wasn't strangled by a rope.<br/><br/>Aubrey bounces into the great cabin. "I say, Pearkes, do you play an instrument?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Violin?"<br/><br/>"No. Er, nay."<br/><br/>"That's dashed unfortunate. We have a first-class violist this trip.

Taken aback, Aubrey asks if he plays "the German flute." (As the traverse flute was known then.)<br/><br/>"As long as it isn't a French flute, I'll play it."<br/><br/>"Perhaps we can play some Corelli flute and strings...what do you say, Stephen?"<br/><br/>Maturin glances at Pearkes over his colored spectacles. "I'd have to hear the gentleman play," he says dryly.<br/><br/><i>[Gave PP a flat Preparedness roll here; he doesn't have Art, but I thought it was reasonable that Preparedness would cover having learned a piece in his youth. PP spent 5.]</i><br/><br/>Aubrey sends for one of the Marines who plays flute, and gives it to Pearkes. The Colonel plays a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bach_-_Partita_For_Solo_Flute_-_Modern_Flute_-_1._Allemande.ogg" rel="nofollow">somber Bach partitia</a>.<br/><br/>"I say, what was that? It was quite good."<br/><br/>"Bach."<br/><br/>"English Bach? Doesn't sound like him. His father? Sebastian Bach?"<br/><br/>"Johann Sebastian Bach."<br/><br/>"That's the fellow. I was at the music-seller's in London, and I bought some of his stuff. Was asking nothing for it."<br/><br/>"This is extraordinary!" says Pearkes. In his trembling hand he holds an autograph copy of some Bach violin music.<br/><br/><i>[That's an actual incident in the novels, btw.]</i><br/><br/>"What do you say we give it a go!" Matarin is already taking out his cello. Pearkes listens with enjoyment--Aubrey is quite talented.<br/><br/>Pearkes is quartered in the cabin for the night. He is able to gather from them that they are in the North Atlantic, cruising off the coast of America, which has recently declared war on England.<br/><br/><i>[I let PP choose where they were, and when he settled on the North Atlantic (mostly so he could be closer to Canada, for verisimilitude for Pearkes' backstory, he also agreed that it should be in 1812, opening up the American war and pretty much assuring that this sequence would end with a confrontation between the </i>Surprise<i> and one of the American superfrigates.]</i><br/><br/>The next day Pearkes walks the quarterdeck. He talks with one of the officers about the new American frigates. The leftenant is quite concerned, mentioning that the USS <i><del>United States</del> Constitution</i> just pasted Java.<br/><br/><i>[EDIT: Why did I think it was </i>United States<i>? Silly GM...]</i><br/><br/>"Well, that's half the globe away."<br/><br/>"The HMS <i>Java</i>, sir. And they were significantly larger than us. Good old <i>Surprise</i>, she's still the fastest ship of her class on the water. So we can run!"<br/><br/>The marine commander also talks to Pearkes, The Colonel gets the feeling that he is being subtly felt out--the questions are all about different details of his military career, and Pearkes has the sinking feeling that he missed some important details.<br/><br/>The sailors manage to whip one of the marines' officer uniforms into something appropriate for Pearkes to wear. Soon he too is baking in a red wool coat and waistcoat under the noon sun while Aubrey reads the Articles of War to the crew--it's Sunday, and this passes for chapel. Then they sit down and have a massive multi-course meal in the stifling great cabin. Pearkes gives the toast, stretching his brain to remember the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_(honor)#Traditional_toasts" rel="nofollow">historically accurate toast for the day</a>.<br/><br/><i>[I did not know about the toasts of the day--PP served for a while in the Canadian Navy, and so was familiar with the custom.]</i><br/><br/>The officers are understandably interested in how Pearkes came to be found. "I was on my way back to Canada, and my ship went down," he says.<br/><br/>"But...the only ship in the area was that area was that French ship we sank."<br/><br/>Pearkes shrugs.

They take care of the whole community; somebody's gotta."<br/><br/>"If you think you might be feeling better later," says Charleston to Noor, "here are the things I need you to research..."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Charleston makes his way into Chinatown. He notices that the Chinese he encounters are mostly menial, low-wage workers. From the newspapers he reads on the way he discovers that the Germans seem to have set up a puppet state in the Eastern United States, with a buffer zone called the Rocky Mountain States in between the Japanese and German regions. He also notes that slavery seems to have been revived in the southern states.<br/><br/>Entering the laundromat, Charleston's Triad reflexes spring to life: this is clearly a bunch of tough characters.<br/><br/>"Whadya want?"<br/><br/>"I was referred by Cousin Wu. I want to launder on your behalf."<br/><br/>"You looking for a job? You got papers?"<br/><br/>"What are these papers you speak of?"<br/><br/>"There's a tea shop out back. Go have a cup."<br/><br/>Charleston steps into the alley. Two thugs immediately grab him and force him into the basement, where he is confronted by a suit-wearing, cigarette-smoking lieutenant.<br/><br/>"Where are you from?" he asks.<br/><br/>"Uh, Nanking."<br/><br/>"Your accent's not Nanking."<br/><br/>"Right. Look, I don't have papers, I'm just getting accustomed to here. But I used to make deliveries. Nighttime deliveries, across borders..."<br/><br/>"We can find something for you."<br/><br/>"Good. Name's Charleston Chiu."<br/><br/>"This is Dancer Lee's crew. You avoid Fat Tang's crew, they have it in for us."<br/><br/>"So if I should make this 'Fat Tang' disappear..."<br/><br/>"You'd have to clear that with the boss. He's in charge of all West Coast operations. I need you to make a delivery. Take this down to the wharf." He hands Charleston a smallish box. "Don't let anybody stop you. Don't get caught."<br/><br/>"I can also drive rather well."<br/><br/>"You know how to drive stick?"<br/><br/>"Are you coming on to me?"<br/><br/>"Brother, you are really lost. So, steal a car, make the delivery, and lose the car. Then we'll know something about you."<br/><br/>"Is there a deadline or a drop dead date on this?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. If you don't deliver it by dawn, you'll drop dead."<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418110/#Comment_418110" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-10T23:05:34+00:00" title="July 10, 2013 11:05PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, I'm really interested in Eternal Lies, next time I'm at FLGS with scratch I'll check it out :-)</blockquote>\nI'm willing to run it, either ftf or via email, though I've not yet decided on system.\n<blockquote>Feel free to plunder anything from PMON, or at least avoid my mistakes...</blockquote>\nThanks.

That is, instead of working with the GM for an outcome ("I want to use this goat to test the water") it was all individual stages (catch the goat, tie up the goat, throw the goat in the river, retrieve the goat...)</blockquote>\nYah. It's a bit of a X-Y problem. If someone asks me, "How high up from the ground is this room?", the question I should ask is "Why?" The player probably does not want to know X (how high up is the room) per se, but Y (likely: can the investigator jump out of the window safely).<br/><br/>If I think this is a simulationist question about the height of a building and of one of the rooms therein, I am likely to give an answer I don't really care about either way, one that blocks the player's preferred course of action.

If not, I should probably say, "Oh, sure, you can absolutely climb out the window."<br/><br/>Similarly, if I don't know why the PCs want the blasted goat, I'm likely to waste everyone's time with the wild goat chase, thinking that, for whatever reason, the players are having fun chasing a goat around to cause Wacky Hijinks.

Possibly combine this with, "Okay, if you do that [and phrase it that way even if the player assumes it's already been done], these undesirable consequences will follow. Do you still want to do it?

I did some cursory research on it today and I'm not sure they even use Fronts as we know them in tremulus. <br/><br/>I started to try and define the Paris Brotherhood as a Front today. I think I mostly grasp the concept, and what I noticed right away is that the process was forcing me to clarify motivations and tactics--it was a very interesting experience. I think I'll end up having to try a bunch of different takes before I get the Fronts right, but it should be a good experience.<br/><br/>Having finally read Apocalypse World, which was revelatory--it's one thing to mostly understand the concepts, quite another to actually get the whole thing in one go--I've been pondering ways to import AW techniques into the game.<br/><br/>The Fronts are the obvious place to start--they're perfect for a conspiracy-type game. <br/><br/>I've been listening to the recording of the last session again (beyond the parts I've transcribed so far) and I'm happy to notice that I was trying to get a lot of player input and riffing off their choices. Not nearly enough, but it's a positive sign.<br/><br/>There's at least one major issue in trying to hack AW concepts on top of GUMSHOE: one of the most brilliant features of AW is the <i>partial success</i>; it's the pedal that keeps the plot running. But GUMSHOE is really binary, and designed to be so (in fact, it basically wants to remove chance from the equation at all.) Plus, of course, there's a big difference in the way the moves are structured and relate to each other in AW as opposed to ToC. Though maybe with some thought I could come up with...call 'em templates? Classes of actions, no matter what the skills involved are, that resemble *W moves? This is an interesting thought.<br/><br/>I don't want to go too far, though; having chosen ToC, I should try and solve my issues within its framework. It's just that *W techniques are so damn <i>tempting</i>.\n<blockquote><br/>Yah. It's a bit of a X-Y problem.

In a lot of traditional systems (especially DnD descended ones) there's an implied contract of playing "gotcha" between the PCs and the GM. Breaking that concept is proving hard (on both sides, I should hasten to add) in this game. Not the least because I've only really become aware of it recently!\n<blockquote><br/>You get more than your fair share of blame because you're the Keeper, but really, everyone should be helping everyone stay on the ball.<br/><br/>But, briefly, you were moving fast enough that you made snap decisions, and both you and PP fell into a pattern that, even though neither of you probably likes it, neither of you is sure how to break.

I shorthanded a lot of stuff in defining the question as "why". I'm pretty comfortable with your analysis; it's now more a question of, how does this kind of situation happen? how can I identify it? what steps can I take to minimize this? what strategies are going to be effective to avoid the whole problem entirely? and what issues will <i>they</i> raise?<br/><br/>Again, Apocalypse World has a lot of ideas for how to do this.

Finally it stops. Two thugs drag Freddie out of the back and frogmarch him up into what at one time would have been a respectable townhouse. Freddie notices in passing that the neighborhood was quite well-to-do in his day. He catches a glimpse of vaguely pyramidal buildings on the outskirts of London, and then is forced inside the townhouse.<br/><br/>The interior is well-appointed, if quite dimly lit, with elegant furniture and the first touches of luxury that he has seen since arriving in this place. A flat screen on the wall most astonishingly displays moving pictures in color, and with sound.<br/><br/>As Freddie sinks into an overstuffed couch, he hears a news bulletin: "Comrades! The heroic forces of Oceania have once again emerged victorious in Africa, defeating the evil armies of Eastasia! Rejoice in our victory, and praise to our great leader!"<br/><br/>In another room, he hears people talking. <br/><br/>"You, in the chesterfield! Sit up straight!" blares the screen on the wall.<br/><br/>"What are you talking about? It's a davenport!"<br/><br/>"I'll report you, comrade..." mutters an angry looking woman on the screen. The image changes again to a news report.<br/><br/>Two figures enter the room, but Freddie can't make out their features in the gloom. One sits down in an armchair, while the other continues to speak:<br/><br/>"Oh, and O'Brien wants to do an operation on this Smith character. Says he has it all planned out and its a catch."<br/><br/>"Fine," says the other figure. "O'Brien's always up to something."<br/><br/>"What is it I'm up to?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"You are not O'Brien," says the person in the chair. "I am Comrade General Jeremias of the Thought Police."<br/><br/>"I'm Comrade O'Brien."<br/><br/>"You are not O'Brien."<br/><br/>"That's news to me. I've been O'Brien for a while."<br/><br/>"You are not Comrade O'Brien, or at least not the one I know. I work with him. He is my great rival."<br/><br/>"And there's only one person named O'Brien in all of Oceania, I'm sure."<br/><br/>"What I want to know is, who you really are, and why you have been sent to me."<br/><br/>"My name is O'Brien, and when I showed my papers to the police at the local station, they sent me to you."<br/><br/>"You are not O'Brien. I need to know if you are working for O'Shaughnessy or not. This is the sort of thing he would do."<br/><br/>"I've never heard of him."<br/><br/>"Look, right now we are having a very nice conversation. But if you don't tell me what I need to know, I will take other methods. I don't think you'll find <i>that</i> conversation so pleasant."<br/><br/>"I have no doubt you can torture me into saying anything you want."<br/><br/>"What I really want to know is why you look like Freddie Blakely."<br/><br/>"Don't know who you're talking about."<br/><br/>"You really don't know Freddie Blakely?"<br/><br/>"That sounds like one too many names."<br/><br/>"Of course, you can't really <i>be</i> him. He's been dead for twenty years."<br/><br/>"Well, if I'm clearly not O'Brien, and can't be Freddie Blakely, why don't you tell me who he was? That way I can not tell O'Shaughnessy, whom I've never met."<br/><br/>"Freddie was...very dear to me once. He was a good comrade." The figure leans forward. She is old, in her seventies.<br/><br/>She looks, in fact, like a seventy-year old Jackson Elias.<br/><br/>"You look like a seventy-year old Jackson Elias!" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"How...who told you that name?"<br/><br/>"The same person who didn't tell me about Freddie Blakely."<br/><br/>"And who is this Jackson Elias?"<br/><br/>"Well, she certainly wasn't a socialist who worked with the French underground during the Great War."<br/><br/>"If you know so much about Freddie and Jackson, how did he meet her for the first time?"<br/><br/>"Well, I got drunk at a bar in the Moulin Rouge."<br/><br/><i>[Not sure where I got the idea to put Jax in the "1984" section, but it seemed too good an idea to pass on once I had it. I've enjoyed the interplay between Freddie and her greatly, so I thought this would be fun, and reveal a bit more about their relationship.<br/><br/>Eventually I figured something else about who and what Freddie was in this retelling, but I'll save that for when it happens.]</i><br/><br/>"You're dead. This is impossible."<br/><br/>"Bit of a shock for me too, you know, since you died about three months ago. As far as I'm concerned, it's 1925, and you were killed. I've been on some kind of a vengeance tour, following up your last investigation."<br/><br/><i>[Me: How does Freddie feel about seeing Jackson alive?<br/>FP: Oh, I'm definitely dreaming...<br/>Me: Still, you'll need to make a Stability check.<br/>FP: ...I fail. How much do I lose?<br/>Me: ...7 points. "You speak with someone close to you that you know to be dead."<br/>PP: </i>How much?<i><br/>FP: Do I get a discount because I think I'm dreaming?<br/>Me: Okay, 5 points.]</i><br/><br/>Jackson presses a button on a stand next to her chair and the screen on the wall switches off.<br/><br/>"Oh, right, spying," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"That's kind of my job," says Jackson.<br/><br/>"Well, you were always good at that sort of thing."<br/><br/>"It's not a friendly world, I'm afraid. We tried our best, after the second war, to bring socialism to the people."<br/><br/>"Second war? Oh, you're counting that dustup between the French and the Prussians..."<br/><br/>"No, the Second World War. We didn't come to power until after the Third World War. That was the one we used nuclear weapons in."<br/><br/>"If you're going to throw nonsense terms at me from Jules Verne..."<br/><br/><i>[Decided to cut back to Pearkes here, as the encounter between Jax and Freddie seemed pregnant at this point.<br/><br/>I had originally thought about making the arrival of Jackson some kind of thing--"The Comrade General from America" or something--but ended up going with Jax's faction kidnapping Freddie out of the police station.<br/><br/>Of course, I shouldn't even plan so much ahead, yes?

ToC probably would be a better fit for PBEM, but... I just haven't clicked with the Gumshoe General Combat-and-Everything-Else part of the system. As a player, this isn't a problem. I just spend and roll. As a Keeper / GM, it's a huge problem. Ken Hite's told me that it's really very simple -- create a spend pattern, which can be simple (always spend 2) or more complicated (4-3-2 pattern, then 2 for each round thereafter, unless you have a reason). But, it always feels to me that I'm controlling the fight in ways I shouldn't, so that I'm deciding not just the spend, but whether the PCs will win or lose -- and even if I didn't consider that a problem, I suck at calibration, so I'd likely kill off too many PCs by accident or try not to and it'd be obvious. How do you run it?\n<blockquote>I don't want to go too far, though; having chosen ToC, I should try and solve my issues within its framework.

But, if you want to do a test run, do it when you're doing something like moving each PC into an alternate reality where the rule system can be different too.<br/><br/>I haven't quite grokked Apocalypse World, but I think I could handle running Monsterhearts. Some of the hard move things plus the fronts might be all you need. For Relationships, the Pillars and Sources of Trail pretty much cover that.\n<blockquote>Yeah.

Things start moving fast and cross lines before everyone realizes it. People default to patterns they're used to.<br/><br/>Slow down. This is tricky because we're not talking about a slower pace of action, and we don't want games to flow like molasses in winter. What we want is to stem the panic / split second decision, build in a loop that pulls us back into "let's think about this a moment", and gets us in the head space where we can see during the game all the stuff that's obvious afterwards. It's not easy, and it's always going to be a work in progress, but practice does help.<br/><br/>Nice move with Jackson Elias in Orwell-land.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418187/#Comment_418187" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T04:58:15+00:00" title="July 12, 2013  4:58AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa, I handle the combat-spend stuff in a couple of ways:<br/><br/>--Generally, I have the NPCs spend 2 or 3 all the time (2 if they're not combat focused/supernatural, 3 otherwise).<br/><br/>--I reset expectations: at one point I explicitly told the players that any fight they haven't won by 3 rounds they should run from.<br/><br/>--Generally, I don't think people feel I'm controlling combat--once they grasp that they can autosucceed, they quickly realize it works for the NPCs as well.<br/><br/>But seriously, it's cinematic/narrative combat, so there's a natural routine people can map to--those fight scenes where the bad guys trade blows with the heroes for a while and then suddenly lose competence (when they run out of points.)<br/><br/>Also, my game is extra-crispy pulp, so I've brought in some stuff from Night's Black Agents (critical hits, special moves if you have a rating of 8+ in skills) but there's no need to do that for most implementations.<br/><br/>I agree with your notes about how to handle future situations. One thing I want to do more of is to get the players to be outcome-focused (which is really a stakes-setting mechanism, but I won't have to get too jargon-y) and also enforce some of the AW "If you want to do it, do it" thinking. That is, make the mechanics emerge more from the fiction, while also pointing the players towards thinking about how to direct their narration.<br/><br/>Also, being a bit sharper myself! I think I need to make a cheat sheet like Vincent put in AW. Certainly clarifying my narration in terms of MC moves would be an improvement, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418221/#Comment_418221" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T10:32:06+00:00" title="July 12, 2013 10:32AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Night's Black Agents games I've played all had great cinematic combat -- what I doubt is my ability to do this with the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418228/#Comment_418228" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T11:50:38+00:00" title="July 12, 2013 11:50AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. Could you maybe talk a bit more about your block? I mean, I get it in principle, but maybe step through your concerns?<br/><br/>I tend to make the combat very reactive unless there's an overwhelming reason not to--generally, supernatural. So, it was okay for Hetep to attack Freddie, since the big coolness with Hetep is "fluffy white cat==supernatural badass". Otherwise, I let the PCs choose targets and more or less direct the fight, basing the NPCs actions off of what the PCs do.<br/><br/>I mean, here's the thing about Gumshoe--it's basically a diceless system. A spend of 3 pretty much guarantees success, with rare exceptions. Given that, combat is going to be nervy and deadly, with both sides tending to take a pounding very quickly. Most humans can't stand more than three rounds of combat, no matter what--at least, not without dropping below 0 health. Once the PCs recognize that, then your spends aren't super important--they know you're going to hit, just like they know <i>they're</i> going to hit. So it just becomes about narration and the occasional cool bit of advanced f*ckery.<br/><br/>Hell, for critters with very high pools, I sometimes don't bother to roll, just knock off the points. Speeds things up slightly.<br/><br/>The other thing is that unless you're using some of the crazy rules from NBA, damage is always decoupled from the hit roll, so even hitting all the time doesn't mean that much if your damage output is low. (In fact, I'm pretty sure the -1 and -2 damage modifiers were put there explicitly to cover the fact that moderately experienced players <i>won't miss a combat roll</i>.)<br/><br/>I could see if I could step through one of the combat examples I recorded in greater detail if you think it would help--I think the fight vs. the vampires might be decent for a start--the vamps were pretty powerful and did a number on the PCs, but I don't think I was directing the fight. But maybe I'm wrong?<br/><br/>One thing I'd definitely carry over from NBA is using Investigative skills to aid general ones, although in a purist scenario maybe not for fighting checks. Fleeing, though, that's a definite :-)<br/><br/>'Course, I'm a bit biased--Gumshoe (despite the stuff I'm working through) is easily my favorite current system, and the one I'd run with any group looking for more crunch than *World games. Hell, I'd run <i>Traveller</i> under Gumshoe, if I could--it would be awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418252/#Comment_418252" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T14:13:19+00:00" title="July 12, 2013  2:13PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a disconnect with Gumshoe's general system, I guess. I mean, yes, you can spend for a guaranteed hit. Once or twice. Maybe three times. And, if you're a PC, your best Not Get Hit is likely to be 4, which means that getting hit is really likely, no? I mean, without pulling your punches on purpose, how do you manage not to wipe out PCs accidentally? If you actively don't want to wipe out PCs (because having them go down and get replaced every session kills cool arcs), how does that work with the mechanics? (The impression I get is that it doesn't and isn't meant to and GMs like me who want the PCs to survive much of the game are wimps.)<br/><br/>There's also the question of when refreshes happen. I remember going Ack! when reading NBA -- this game, intended to be cinematic, has a gajillion different rules about which pools get refreshed when. Then, there was a post online about how players should totally spend to the max in combat because GMs will totally give them a refresh, so all's cool. This is not the impression I get in play -- at convention games I've played in, where the game was totally fun and totally cinematic, all the PCs would have bee totally dead if we spent the way the blog writer thought we should.<br/><br/>(And having one's lockpicker suddenly be no better than a guy without Lockpick / Burglary because he's out of points is a disconnect I don't much like, but I'm trying to focus on the things that make me go "How do I run that?" rather than "I don't want to run that like that.")<br/><br/>Maybe a long example would help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418256/#Comment_418256" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T18:30:20+00:00" title="July 12, 2013  6:30PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I will try to accommodate! I don't think there's a big combat in what I have left to write up, so maybe I'll try to get one of the earlier ones up in director's cut mode.<br/><br/>So. Let's talk about this.<br/><br/>First, one must remember that Gumshoe characters are actually pretty resilient. It takes quite a bit to actually <i>kill</i> them--most PCs can take between 18-24 points of damage before being dead, dead, dead. It's not even that easy to drop them--you need about two-three hits to get them to the point where the consciousness check is hard to make. Weapons just don't do that much damage--even a shotgun blast to the face only does about 7-8 points on average.<br/><br/>Second, combat doesn't last that long. Like I said, three rounds and run should be the basic rule for PCs in Gumshoe. (Actually, a surprising amount of games--it's pretty true in d20 as well.) I don't think any of the fights I've presented so far in this AP have lasted longer than four rounds--my only candidates for that are the fight with Polidori and the fight with the Cthonian, and I'd have to check that.<br/><br/>So maybe you see a pattern? Most fights won't last long enough to massacre the PCs. It takes a fair amount of opponents, with guns, to ice multiple PCs. In this AP, only the fight with Shakhti put multiple PCs unconscious. (That fight could have been worse--I mostly forgot about Clive, so we can assume he scampered, or was neutralized by Hypatia.)<br/><br/>I have found that I don't need to pull punches; the system is deadly if you do stupid things, or against really tough opponents, but otherwise the PCs should be able to hold their own. But the fights themselves tend to be very nervy, and have plenty of suspense--this was commented on after the first two sessions by my players.<br/><br/>Also, too. The whole "hit threshold can't get above 4" is a limiting factor on <i>monsters</i>. Sure, the Hunting Horror has like a Scuffling pool of 20. That just means that it can hit multiple people, or hang around in a combat for a long time. It's not going to do more damage. It's not going to be harder to hit. It just has a big pool.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean pool size isn't important (it's initiative, after all), but it tends to have more impact at the lower end--if you give your mooks and low-threat level NPCs small pools, then they probably won't last long enough in a fight to massacre the PCs.<br/><br/>Refreshes are easier. Basically, anything that's fighty refreshes daily. This includes stuff like Driving and Fleeing. So unless you tend to have multiple combats in a day, it makes absolute sense to pump your fighting skills and finish the combat quickly; that's what the essay (I think I read the same one) was getting at. NBA also has a specific, "narrate cool stuff to get a refresh" mechanic for people with ratings of 8+ in the fighty skills, which means that it's easier to get refreshes in it. (Also, one of the common Tactical Fact Finding benefits is a dedicated pool, so that's even more points.)<br/><br/>You can also use the "find a safe haven" rule to refresh when you're in a tight spot. I actually think that's very cinematic--it's the scene where the heroes find a place to hole up for a while and take stock.<br/><br/>The whole thing where your skill pool is low so now you can't do things as effectively is a bit disconcerting; I've found the best way to come to grips with it is to think of it in meta-plot terms (or as a guide to narration). You're in an aerial chase, but your piloting pool is empty? What that <i>really</i> means is that piloting isn't how this scene is going to be resolved. Maybe the guy with Mechanical Repair will have to supe up the engines. Or maybe the guys with the rifles will need to make some daring shots. <br/><br/>Or maybe you have to lighten the plane by tossing something out of it--time for the guy with Scuffling to go to work! ;-)<br/><br/>Or finally, maybe your luck is up. I don't think it's an accident that most of the Gumshoe games are horror games; they do the whole "eventually the bad thing happens no matter what" thing pretty well.<br/><br/>It actually works out to be fairly cinematic, even with the Investigative skills. For example, in this AP, there was a point where Shakhti was taking the PCs through his villa. There was a portrait of Cleopatra in one of the rooms that bore a resemblance to Hypatia Masters, and would have been the second time Freddie had seen something like that--a fairly major clue about Hypatia. Unfortunately, he'd already spent his Art History point on the previous Hypatia image. I invite you to think about this as the camera slowly panning on the picture of Cleopatra/Hypatia as Freddie walks obliviously by...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418262/#Comment_418262" name="Item_191" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T00:59:41+00:00" title="July 13, 2013 12:59AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The overnight refresh explains why the blogger thought it was fine to burn points and why I thought he was insane. He's running for a home group; I was playing four hour convention one shots. We had two or three combats all in the same day, depending on which session we're talking. I'm guessing the home group had one combat a day.<br/><br/>As for the Art History, that's not General, but Investigation. I have no problem with the Investigation rules. Was the portrait a Core Clue? If not, you're fine. If so, could Freddie get the information some other way? Clearly yes, because he did, so you're fine. If not, Freddie doesn't need to spend at all. He's in front of the portrait, and he has the relevant clue.

Lisa asked for an example of how I run GUMSHOE combat, so I thought I'd oblige her with the following example. This goes back to Session 5; the PCs have gone to the Mosque of Ibn Tulun after getting a tip that the Nessim, leader of the guardians of the Girdle of Nitocris has returned there. They also hear a warning that Omar Shakhti's wives, extremely dangerous vampires, are leading the mission.<br/><br/>For reference, I've listed the stats of the main combatants below.<br/></i>\n<table>\n<tr><th colspan="4"><b>The Good Guys</b></th></tr>\n<tr><th></th><th>Gilbert\xa0\xa0</th><th>Freddie\xa0\xa0</th><th>Pearkes\xa0\xa0</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Athletics\xa0</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>10</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Firearms\xa0</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>10</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Health\xa0</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Scuffling\xa0</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Weapons\xa0</td><td></td><td>4\t</td><td>10</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Stability\xa0</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>6</td></tr>\n</table>\n<i>The vampires had Health, Athletics, and Scuffling 10, and Magic 3. They had an alertness modifier of +2, Stealth of +1, and a Hit Threshold of 5--they were unearthly fast.<br/><br/>Not sure that everybody was at full, but let's leave it at that for now.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie is sitting with the Taleb, annoying him, when a knock comes on the door. \u201cI must get rid of this pest,\u201d says the young man. Freddie tags along with him.<br/><br/>The student opens the door. \u201cThe mosque is\u2014\u201d<br/><br/>A shotgun blast drops him.<br/><br/>FP has Freddie draw his shotgun. I decided that would be a 1-pt Firearms spend to draw and shoot in this round, in addition to whatever he wanted to spend to take the shot. Freddie spends 2 and gets a 6, taking his firearms down to 2.<br/><br/>He gets a 6, easily hitting, and rolls a 4 + 4 for damage--8 points (he fired both barrels at close range). I didn't give these guys any health, so 8 points cuts them in half.<br/><br/>Outside are two guys with guns drawn. "It's Blakely, kill him!" FP wants to slam the "heavy wooden" door shut, latch it and run. Doing the first two is fine, but to get away, it's a 1-point Athletics or Fleeing spend. FP spends 1 Fleeing, going down to 9. He reloads as he runs inside.<br/><br/>Upstairs, Pearkes hears the shots and draws his revolver. Gilbert runs towards the sound of shooting. Since Freddie has Bad Luck as his drive, Gilbert smashes into Freddie in the mosque's sanctuary.  Gilbert's gun goes flying, but he's able to pick it up.<br/><br/>At this point there's a strange singing.<br/><br/>Pearkes runs down the corridor (he's upstairs, checking out the insane asylum section.) PP calls for a Preparedness roll to have earplugs; I just say Yes and let him continue. He does hear a woman's voice calling out for him--his fiancee Constance's voice, as a matter of fact.<br/><br/>Pearkes and Billy go to free the woman, believing this woman to be Constance. <i>[Gotta have at least one vampire using its disguise ability.]</i><br/><br/>Downstairs, Freddie gets up and straps on the genuine antique scimitar he bought. GP decides to have Gilbert try and sneak behind one of the many columns in the room to get out of sight. The strange singing--actually, a form of the Dominate spell--is all around him. I call for a Stability check, opposed by the vampire's roll plus one point from her 3-point Magic pool. GP rolls a 4, failing. (I don't remember what I rolled, but it was above a 4.)<br/><br/>This puts him under the temporary control of the vampire. Gilbert turns around and aims his shotgun at Freddie.<br/><br/>Freddie dodges behind a column. He tries to see where the singing is coming from but it is too dim. <i>[Being under cover is what prevented this from working--see below. Also she made a good Stealth roll.]</i><br/><br/>Upstairs, Pearkes sees cultists with rifles moving up the stairs. PP calls for a Preparedness roll for "another grenade". I was getting a bit tired of grenades, but hey, it's his dime. PP spends his last point of Preparedness, makes a 6 on the roll, and so I let him bomb a thousand year old mosque with a grenade.<br/><br/>Downstairs, Freddie calls out to Gilbert, trying to calm him down. <i>[The way GP said "Yes. Yes I can." in answer to FP's question of whether he could hear him was spookily good.]</i> Freddie asks Gilbert to shoot the singer, not him, but the vampire tosses that back.<br/><br/>GP asks if he can stab himself. I don't rule yet, but it begins the theme of him and FP trying to break the spell.<br/><br/>FP makes a Flattery spend, trying to play on Gilbert's past as a Soviet commissar to avoid working for "some century old monarchist." I allow a new Stability roll, and promptly gets a 1 on the die; meanwhile I have the vampire make another Magic point spend and she beats GP's roll.<br/><br/>I rule that Gilbert shoots the pillar--I made the attack roll, but with no Firearms spend. At this point, though, I put GP on notice that eventually he'll need to make Stability rolls to prevent himself from making Firearms spends to shoot Freddie--I was going to basically make it a Driver of some sort.<br/><br/>Pearkes leads Billy and "Constance" into a large room with asylum inmates chained to the wall. As they try to leave, the chains fall away from the inmates and they begin to chant "Shakhti...Shakhti..." A figure drops from the ceiling in front of the exit. Pearkes pushes Constance behind him. I give PP a point of Stability for protecting his fiancee, and being a good sport.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, GP is trying to find a way out of his predicament. He checks his Drive--Loyalty--and its a bit problematic; has his loyalty been transferred to the vampire? <br/><br/>FP has a new plan: he offers Gilbert a raise. I rule that Gilbert shoots the pillar again, and begins to reload. FP notes he can shoot Gilbert now, but "I like him." Freddie ducks his head around the pillar to look for the singer. I run through what skills he could use as "Perception."<br/><br/>GP asks if he can use Filch to try and mess up reloading his shotgun. I say he can slow down the reloading (no skill roll required) but it's a Soft Driver, having decided that his loyalty has transferred to the vampire--so it costs 2 points of Stability, dropping Gilbert to 3.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418394/#Comment_418394" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T21:03:22+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  9:03PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>GUMSHOE Combat Example: The Fight at the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, Part 2</b><br/><br/><br/>FP decides to spend his last unspent experience point for Evidence Collection, and makes a spend. He spies the vampire perched on a pulpit. <br/><br/>FP: How far off?<br/><br/>Me: Pretty far off in the dim light.<br/><br/>FP: I have a double-barreled sawed-off shotgun. There's no way I'm hitting her from far away--I've actually fired those, and they're wildly inaccurate.<br/><br/><i>[This was one of those times when FP's love of verisimilitude helped keep the fiction somewhere loosely tethered to reality.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie has Stealth, so FP spends 3 points and gets a 9. This beats the target of 6--the vampires have a +2 Alertness modifier.<br/><br/>Gilbert finishes loading his shotgun. He wants to spend Athletics to slow down aiming, but I once again rule it's a Soft Driver. He spends it, to drop to 1 point of Stability.<br/><br/>Freddie is now in shotgun range, and I decide to cut back to Pearkes.<br/><br/>Pearkes tries to talk to the vampire upstairs, but she decides to just kill "Constance" by throwing a dagger into her heart. PP asks for an Athletics roll to get in the way. PP spends 4 points on the roll, but only gets a 5; the vampire put 3 points into her weapons roll and once again I rolled well. PP asks if he can spend more points, but FP tells him this "isn't Pathfinder--there's no Hero Points." If you're looking for potential player discomfort, this was one situation--PP said he didn't know the vampire would put 3 points in or he would have spent more. Lesson: make sure your players understand that the opposition spends points too!<br/><br/>I call for a 4-point Stability test for seeing his fiancee die. PP spends 2 and easily makes it. <br/><br/>Me: You're fine, except for the fact that your fiancee was brutally murdered.<br/><br/>PP: She's not dead yet.<br/><br/>Me: I said "in the heart," but OK. <i>[I rolled something high--6 points or so.]</i> Yeah.<br/><br/>PP: She's not dead <i>yet</i>.<br/><br/>Me: She's dying and dying fast.<br/><br/>FP: This is the 1920s. They don't have the technology.<br/><br/><i>[Here's an interesting situation--PP was clearly angling for a chance to save "Constance." Now, I knew it wasn't Constance, but a vampire in disguise. But still--was PP signalling that this was an unacceptable alteration of his character? Or just not wanting to lose? I hope I'd make it clear that Sources of Stability were going to be menaced. The more I go over these, the more I'm struck by just how bad the communication was between us in-game. I think some of my frustration has been that this wasn't a problem with the other players.]</i><br/><br/>Billy immediately blows his Stability roll. The inmates jump him--he's below 0 Stability and in Fight or Flight mode, so out comes his kukri. This also allowed me to let the mooks just be color and not complicate the fight. I think going forward I'm going to steal an idea from 13th age and just have mooks share a single pool.<br/><br/>PP has George draw his sword and do a leaping attack at the vampire. Since we're using many of the combat rules from Night's Black Agents, I point out that it is possible to do a called shot to the throat.<br/><br/>Me: It raises the difficulty by 3...<br/><br/>PP: I spend 10.<br/><br/>Me: ...you spend <i>10</i>?<br/><br/>PP: She killed my fiancee.<br/><br/>So Pearkes hits her. The vamps are very fast--hit threshold of 5--but he rolls a 5 on the die for a final total of 15. At this point I break out the critical hits rules from NBA--but he doesn't crit. His damage is at +3, plus the unknown (and undefined by me--I usually just decided whether or not it killed people) damage bonus of the Sword of Akmallah. But he rolls a 1.<br/><br/>Still, I wanted to reward him for such derring-do, so I ruled her hand was cut off trying to block the slash. It was so cool I also gave him a 2-point refresh to his Weapons pool. This is a rule from NBA but I recommend it if you're looking for a not-to-intrusive way to extend PC survivability in ToC. (Basically, if you have 8+ in a fighty skill, you not only get a benefit--usually +1 damage to a single weapon--but can refresh your pool by narrating some cool gun, kung, or sword-fu.)<br/><br/>Then she goes. I just spend 3 points from her Scuffling pool; I had her spend 3 points every time. This knocks back Pearkes for 5 points of damage.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418395/#Comment_418395" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T21:03:53+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  9:03PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>GUMSHOE Combat Example: The Fight at the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, Part 3</b><br/><br/>FP takes the shot, gets a 7, and hits. He does 9 points of damage. Unfortunately, all the vamps take half damage from physical attacks, so she's still up.<br/><br/>GP wants to see if the attack breaks the spell. He makes a Stability test, but is afraid to make a spend. He rolls a 4, but so did I and I spent her last point from her Magic pool. At this point I remind him that in the past I'd ruled that refreshing Stability can at least allow a new roll to break the domination. I ask GP to define his Symbol, and he comes up with a picture of his old comrades in the Paris Soviet. He has it on him, and I intimate that if somebody can remind him of it, he might get to refresh.<br/><br/>Freddie begins to sing the Internationale. Gilbert begins to join in, and tearfully pulls out his picture. He gets a 1-point Stability refresh, spends himself down to 0, gets a 4, and beats my roll of 3.<br/><br/>At this point I decided to reward GP with another action. He asks me if he can run up, wrap her arm to brace, and use the shotgun to blow her head off. I rule, what the heck. I call for an Athletics roll; GP spends 4 and gets a 6. The vampire is incredibly fast.<br/><br/>GP spends 8 points in Scuffling to grab her, and gets a 9. I cut to Pearkes.<br/><br/>PP wants to know if he landed near his gun. I ask for an Athletics check, but he only gets a 3. He decides to attack with his sword, but her Scuffling pool is currently much larger than his Weapons pool so she goes first. 3 point spend, so she picks him up and tosses him against a wall for 4 points.<br/><br/>FP: Cinematics--as she throws you you slash.<br/><br/>Me: Yeah, that's cool.<br/><br/>He spends two and rolls a 3. The vampire yawns.<br/><br/>GP goes for the called shot--he needs an 8 to get the neck shot. GP asks me for anything he can do to get more damage--this was one of the reasons he asked to grab her arm. I ponder, then check NBA's extra damage rules--for 4 Firearms and 1 Stability he can do an extra die of damage. He puts all 4 remaining points into the shot, but still needs to get an 8. I point out that he can use an Investigative ability to potentially help. He mentions Forensics to give him a knowledge of anatomy. I let him refresh 3 points of his Firearms from a 1 point Forensics spend.<br/><br/>FP: I'm thinking of something straightforward: when you were a commissar in the Russian Revolution, you had a preferred way of executing your prisoners.<br/><br/>GP makes a 7-point spend, and just makes the roll, getting a 9 total. 2d6 + 4 + 1 later, he blows her head off.<br/><br/>He then blows his 5-point Stability test; this included his possession and blowing somebody's head off. He drops to -6 and loses a point of Sanity. FP makes his Stability check.<br/><br/>GP asks if he can get any of his Firearms back, but I point out he's had his big screen moment.<br/><br/>Back upstairs, PP makes an Athletics roll to land near his guns. He gets a 9 and comes up with the guns in his hands. He spends 4 Firearms and a Stability point to get an extra die of damage. He does 9 points--not enough to knock out the vampire. "That's uncivil," she says. She smacks the empty guns out of his hands (another 3-point Scuffling spend) and tries to Dominate him--PP spends 2 but he doesn't beat my roll of 6. "Constance" stands up behind him to try and feed. I call for another Stability test, but change my mind, and make it a Hard Driver; PP gains the 2 points of Stability.<br/><br/>The two vampires begin to squabble. Billy wanders downstairs, Stability blasted. FP tells Gilbert to stay downstairs, while Billy licks blood off of his knife. Freddie runs upstairs, but GP says "I'm just going to follow you." <i>[Playing his Stability! Yes!]</i><br/><br/>Upstairs, the vamps feed; I charge Pearkes a <i>rating</i> point of Health loss. FP has Freddie shoot the one-handed vamp. He does 10 points of damage, dropping the vamp.<br/><br/>The Domination ends, but it's another Hard Driver for Pearkes to resist Constance; PP picks up the 2 points of Stability but blows his attack.<br/><br/>Freddie draws his sword and cuts off the downed vamp's head. Then FP voluntarily rolls for Stability, making it. GP wants to attack, but is in Flight or Fight mode, so I tell him that he can only attack a target that is actually doing something--in this case Pearkes. However, at this point we remember that Pearkes needs to make an unconsciousness test. He fails, and drops to the floor. Gilbert just huddles in a corner.<br/><br/>"Constance" tries to dominate Freddie, but he beats her Stability. She then spends 3-Scuffling and throws Freddie into a wall for 5 points. GP wants to have Gilbert attack "Constance", and FP evolves a plan--he makes a Flattery spend to distract the vampire while GP sneaks up behind her to stake her.<br/><br/>I like that plan and so it works, but at the end the vamp decides to bite Freddie for 6 points of damage.<br/><br/>GP wants to grab her from behind and then take the called shot to the chest. I call for a Scuffling roll; he spends 2 and gets a 6. Then GP realizes he won't have any points to attack with, but I let him change the first roll to Athletics. He spends 2 Scuffling on the attack and makes the called shot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these vamps aren't European, and an ash stake through the heart doesn't kill her. Another 3 point spend, another 6 points of damage to Gilbert. <br/><br/>Freddie, at -3 Health, spends 2 points on his unconsciousness check; he autosucceeds, but drops to -5. He makes a 4 point Weapons spend to jam his stake into her, and that's just enough--she drops.<br/><br/>Whew! That was a lot. I'll let this simmer and try and come up with some notes later.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418399/#Comment_418399" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T23:13:57+00:00" title="July 15, 2013 11:13PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I'll try to parse and figure out coherent questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418401/#Comment_418401" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T23:30:29+00:00" title="July 15, 2013 11:30PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>GUMSHOE EXAMPLE: The Fight At the Mosque of Ibn Tulun</b><br/><br/><i>The vampires had Health, Athletics, and Scuffling 10, and Magic 3.

This is why Pearkes got tossed around so badly. Even so, it took three rounds to knock him to the edge of unconsciousness. He made some suboptimal spends during the fight, or he would have been dealing damage to her in turn. (Oh, I made a mistake up there--he didn't have the Sword of Akmallah yet. He got a +1 to damage because he specialized in his cavalry sword.)<br/><br/>One of the time-honored ways to keep the PCs surviving is to give less Health to opponents, and treat them as out at 0 Health; I usually do something like that. Also, it usually requires 2 to 1 odds to ensure PC death, or a massive disparity of damage dealt.<br/><br/>Initiative: I had to go look the rule up again, although I've been running it intuitively. One on one, the aggressor is the one who goes first; if nobody's sure who goes first, then it's the person with the highest current pool value in the skill they're using. In combats with more opponents, you go straight to the pool comparison. Initiative doesn't reset between rounds. I was correct, although for the wrong reason, in letting the vamp go before Pearkes after the first round--she was the aggressor, having started the fight by "killing" "Constance"; pool value didn't come in to it.<br/><br/>As for Freddie and the door...well, it was a gimmee. Had the mooks outside been more important to the combat, I would have given them a chance to shoot. But since this fight was about meeting the Wives of Shakhti, I didn't have a problem with neutralizing the mooks, who were there largely for color and verisimilitude.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418437/#Comment_418437" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T10:57:57+00:00" title="July 16, 2013 10:57AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">@GB_Steve</a>: Yeah, that one was super useful to me too when I was figuring this stuff out.<br/><br/>There's also <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?449331-Trail-of-Cthulhu-Masks-of-Nyarlathotep&amp;p=10865085#post10865085" rel="nofollow">this post</a> on rpg.net wherein somebody else had the daft idea to run Masks under Trail.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: The Windmills of Your Mind (Part 5)</b><br/><br/><i>Somewhere in 1812...</i><br/><br/>The next morning Pearkes is walking on the quarterdeck. He watches the midshipmen--most under the age of 13--learn how to use the sextant.<br/><br/>"Sail ahoy!" shouts someone from aloft. Aubrey slides down a shroud as the first lieutenant hands Pearkes his spyglass. <br/><br/>There's a large ship closing on them, flying Dutch colors.<br/><br/>"Think we'll be able to outpace them?" says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"I hope so," says Aubrey grimly. He begins to bark orders to the crew. <i>Surprise</i> begins to heel over as it picks up speed.<br/><br/>"Are you beating to quarters?"<br/><br/>"Not close enough yet. Besides, I think our best chance is to outrun them at this point."<br/><br/><i>[Aubrey running? Well, he was generally realistic about when he was outclassed. Most of the crew suspects this is an American superfrigate.]</i><br/><br/>"Is there anything I can do, Captain?"<br/><br/>"Can you shoot?"<br/><br/>"I can. I'm also rather good with a sword."<br/><br/>"It may come to boarding, Colonel, and if it does I expect you to join me in the boarding party."<br/><br/>"It would be a pleasure. Nothing would give me more delight than laying out some French heads on the deck."<br/><br/>"Indeed."<br/><br/>Maturin looks at Pearkes over his colored spectacles. "Indeed it would, now?"<br/><br/>The other ship rapidly closes. As it does, it runs up the Stars and Stripes. Aubrey identifies it as the USS <i>Constitution</i>.<br/><br/>"At least it will give us a chance to redeem <i>Java</i>," he says.<br/><br/>Pearkes tries to read the crew. <i>Constitution</i> has nearly double their guns, and all of them throw heavier shells than <i>Surprise</i>.<br/><br/>The crew beats to quarters. The decks are sanded, to soak up blood. The middies meet their sections by their guns, tiny boys next to large cannon.<br/><br/>Pearkes draws the Sword of Akmallah and readies himself.<br/><br/>"That's a most interesting weapon you have there, Colonel," says Dr. Maturin.<br/><br/>"All the best weapons are."<br/><br/>"Indeed. When I was at University, I used to go out myself once or twice a week. I never understood the British custom of not dueling."<br/><br/>"Any time you wish to test your skills, I'm ready. It's very sharp, though. I wouldn't want to hurt your pretty face."<br/><br/>"Colonel, had we more leisure, I would perhaps make you regret those words."<br/><br/>"You may attempt your attempts."<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, this can wait until after the batter. Then I'd be glad to second one, or both of you," says Aubrey.<br/><br/>Pearkes decides to teach the middies and the boarding parties everything he learned about close quarters fighting from four years on the Western Front. By the end, the children are blinking back tears.<br/><br/><i>[PP used History. Then he asked if he could use Intimidation. Sussing him out, I said that if he wanted a boarding action, there was only one person to talk to.]</i><br/><br/>"Permission to take command of your marines, Captain? I am a bit of a specialist in this."<br/><br/>"That's excellent, but we're going to engage them with cannons first."<br/><br/>"This may seem a rather audacious plan, but given how outclassed we are with guns, perhaps we should take the fight to them first."<br/><br/>"Colonel, no. The American ship probably carries 300 men."<br/><br/>"But it would be a crown jewel to take as a prize. Fortune favors the daring--and you know that <i>Java</i> did not fare so well with traditional tactics."<br/><br/>"We'll have to run her guns...they'll probably get off a couple of broadsides...we don't have a lot of men."<br/><br/>"You have me," says Pearkes with a demoniacal glint in his eye. "You don't need a lot of men."<br/><br/><i>[Intimidation spend by PP. Aubrey is convinced, probably because this insane plan resembles any number of his own insane plans.</i><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418768/#Comment_418768" name="Item_202" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-21T19:16:49+00:00" title="July 21, 2013  7:16PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry about the long delay!

I told him how big it was--about 8" on a side, and when he asked me how heavy it was, I answered with a question--"I don't know, how heavy is it?" Turns out it was very light.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston maps out a few routes to and from the waterfront. "Thanks again for your cousin."<br/><br/>"Yeah, he's okay when he's sober."<br/><br/>"Oh believe me, he got sober quickly when I showed up."<br/><br/>Charleston thumbs through an auto-fancier's magazine to familiarize himself with the contemporary cars. His jaw drops in amazement--automatic transmission, steel-belted tires, advanced suspension...<br/><br/>He walks around observing San Francisco. The Golden Gate Bridge keeps drawing his eye--he'd never seen such a long suspension bridge. He walks his planned entrance and escape routes. He discovers that his early 1920s gangster slang is considered "cool" by the young Japanese kids, even if he is not.<br/><br/>Eventually he wanders down into the poor white neighborhood. He decides to steal a car and plant it as his getaway vehicle. Eventually, he settles on a 1940s vintage Packard. He waits until evening and then slips up to the car, which has new tires, and pops the door lock. He fiddles with the ignition wires and the car starts up.<br/><br/>"OOOOOOwwwooooooooooooo! Broadcasting live from Mexico City, it's Wooooolfman Jack!" The car fills with an incredible racket like no music Charleston has ever heard. He flaps around at the dashboard until he manages to lower the volume. A radio inside a car--amazing!<br/><br/><i>[I figured even in alt-Earth Wolfman Jack might be broadcasting from pirate radio stations--American "folk music", of course.]</i><br/><br/>As Charleston peels out, the car's owner runs out of his house, shaking his fist. Charleston accelerates smoothly down the street, hardly believing the car's power--it's easily the best care he's ever driven.<br/><br/>He figures out how to change stations on the radio. San Francisco has a very diverse musical landscape--he hears everything from koto music to classic American jazz introduced in Japanese. A Classical music program is broadcast from the Reich, and on one channel he hears an English comedian named Bob Hope (apparently living in Canada) telling jokes about the Germans.<br/><br/><i>[Shout out to the source material--Hope is mentioned as broadcasting from Canada.]</i><br/><br/>He parks the car near the waterfront and goes in search of a box truck. He steals a cap from a passerby, puts it on, and climbs into the cab of a parked truck. A Japanese policeman waves at him. "Come on mac, you can't stay there all night."<br/><br/>He drives down towards the warehouse he was told to deliver the package to. Only one truck is parked there, although there are lights on inside the place. He stops the truck several hundred feet away, walks around to the back, and finds a heavy package. He jumps up onto the truckcab's running board, makes sure his delivery box is safely secured inside, slips the truck into gear, and drops the package on the accelerator, jumping off as it begins to pick up speed.<br/><br/>As the truck tears off down the wharf, he begins to dash towards the Packard. A huge crash echos behind him as the truck crashes into the warehouse. Shadowy figures materialize in the fog, spraying the area with submachinegun fire. He dodges down some alleys and vanishes into the fog himself. As he nears the Packard, he hears a single loud report from a rifle. Shrugging, he jumps into the Packard and drives off at a deliberate pace.<br/><br/>He drives back into the neighborhood he stole the car from and parks it about a block from the house he stole it from. <br/><br/>He gets to the laundromat around midnight. "That was an interesting way to fulfill your mission. We thought you'd just deliver the package, but we got the killshot anyway."<br/><br/>"I'm not completely incompetent. Just completely insane."<br/><br/>"We saw how you drove that car. You clearly know what you're doing. You ground the gears a lot."<br/><br/>"What's the deal with all those gears, anyway? And those Packards really haul!"<br/><br/>"Right. Well, we told Dancer about what you did. He was amused, and then thoughtful."<br/><br/>"Any possibility of more work?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. As a matter of fact, he wants to meet you tomorrow at the club. Meantime, here's a couple hundred bucks to tide you over. We also have a guy who can help get you papers."<br/><br/>"Do I really need them?"<br/><br/>"Let's just say that if they catch you without your papers, deportation back to China would be the least of your worries."<br/><br/>"You know, I've never been."<br/><br/>"To China?"<br/><br/>"Yes. I'm from Shanghai."<br/><br/>"But that's in China..."<br/><br/>"Not this Shanghai."<br/><br/><i>[CP has said Charleston comes from the town of Shanghai, West Virginia. Which is a real place! Although in game-earth, it's probably called that because his Shanghailese parents moved there.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston makes his way back to Cousin Wu's. "Here's your rent," he says.<br/><br/>"Cool. Your girlfriend's still sick."<br/><br/>"Can you call that sawbones?"<br/><br/>"Sure. He's a traditional doctor, but he went to med school too. Oh, she gave me this list of books for you to get for her."<br/><br/>The list includes a general history of the world, a map of San Francisco, and recent copies of local newspapers.<br/><br/>"What! We're not even convinced that this is even realll....hey, Cousin Wu, I had a hard night, could I have some of that 'medication' you smoke?"<br/><br/>"Hey man, that's not included in the rent."<br/><br/>"C'mon man, we're buddies, can't we work something out."<br/><br/>"Oh, all right. Hey, you want to listen to some folk music?"<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"American folk music. It's all the rage, man."<br/><br/>Wu puts on an album that sounds remarkably like Jefferson Airplane as Charleston lights up a surprisingly strong joint. "Where's the brass section?" he mutters, looking at the album sleeve, which shows several defiant-looking young Japanese wearing colorful outfits.<br/><br/>A couple of hours later Charleston staggers out and finds an after-hours noodle joint. A man in a fedora and a woman are sitting at the empty counter, while the Korean soda jerk cleans a glass. The place is called Hopper's. A sign advertises the Night Hawkers special--$1.50.<br/><br/>Charleston orders fried chicken with a side of waffles.<br/><br/>"Hunh?" says the soda jerk.<br/><br/>"Habit I picked up in New York."<br/><br/>"Well, we don't usually do ethnic food, but whatever. I'm glad I left the Eastern states, man. You know the [racial slurs] still sends Jews to the Eastern States when they find them? G*damn Germans."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419346/#Comment_419346" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T20:58:51+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  8:58PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: The Windmills of Your Mind (Part 7)</b><br/><br/><i>Somewhere in 1984...</i><br/><br/>"Jax, before I open up my soul to you, can you answer me one question?"<br/><br/>"Yes?"<br/><br/>"Who was it signed those papers letting you go to Archangel?"<br/><br/>"Some British officer...Parkes?

Since its a war zone, yes."<br/><br/>"It wasn't exactly peaceful when I was there."<br/><br/>"All right. I'll have Alphonse make arrangements."<br/><br/>"Alphonse? <i>Bertie</i>?"<br/><br/>"Comrade Alphonse is my personal secretary." She nods at an elderly gentleman, who looks very much like an older version of Alphonse Gilbert.<br/><br/>"Come." He motions at Freddie and they walk together downstairs and towards the entrance to the house.<br/><br/>Freddie stares at Bertie as they walk. He is about to ask him something when the front door bursts open. A gunshot rings out and Gilbert drops to the ground.<br/><br/>"Freeze!" says a man in a leather trenchcoat. Around him, five or six Thought Police goons with automatic rifles gesture menacingly at Freddie.<br/><br/>"You too, Comrade General!" says the man as Jax comes downstairs.<br/><br/>"Who do you think you are?" she says.<br/><br/>"You have a date at the Ministry of Truth, both of you," gloats the man in the trenchcoat.<br/><br/>Jax and Freddie are hooded and shackled, and then thrown into the trunk of a car. Soon they are trundling along.<br/><br/>"Jax, do you want me to take these cuffs off?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"How are you going to do that?"<br/><br/>"My goodness, you taught me how!" Freddie gathers himself, then manages to dislocate his thumb. Biting back the pain, he pulls his hand through the cuff and removes their hoods.<br/><br/><i>[Filch spend by FP--he was going to pick the lock, but shied away when I told him it would be fairly hard. This was cooler anyway.]</i><br/><br/>"So what's the plan, Jax?"<br/><br/>"Well, they're going to take us to Minitrue--"<br/><br/>"Torture us, kill us, yes--"<br/><br/>"They might not kill us, but they'll definitely torture us."<br/><br/>"So the sort of thing that you were threatening me with just fifteen minutes ago?"<br/><br/>"In a nutshell. I imagine these are O'Shaughnessy's people. If I can't convince them not to do it based on who I am, then I think we're done for."<br/><br/>"Does he consider you as much of a rival as you consider him to be?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. He's an up-and-comer, wants to get rid of all of us Old Comrades. Doesn't remember the struggle...he'll probably have us vaporized."<br/><br/>"Then you should come with me to Arabia. I know nothing of London, and that was true even when I lived here, so I'll need your help after we escape."<br/><br/><i>[I'll say this about FP--he never lets go of an idea, and that fits Freddie to a T.]</i><br/><br/>"What about the guards?"<br/><br/>"Let me show you a trick my driver, Charleston, taught me." Freddie fishes in his pockets. Although he's been very thoroughly searched, his small nail-paring knife, hidden in the seam of his trousers, was not found.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness buy by FP, and a very low one.]</i><br/><br/>He dislocates Jax's thumb and pops her free of her cuffs. Then he opens up his knife. He slices down a seam of the back seat, and peaks through. A guard is sitting in the back of the car.<br/><br/><i>[Stealth spend by FP.]</i><br/><br/>Gathering up his courage, he plunges the tiny blade into the man's carotid artery. Blood spurts everywhere as the guard slumps forward. Freddie pulls the dying man's pistol and puts a bullet in the back of the driver's head. The car begins to spin, and then with a sickening thud the car bangs into something, skids, and flips over. <br/><br/><i>[Weapons spend, and a crit on the attack; Filch to take the gun, then Firearms to shoot the driver. Everyone took a die of damage from the crash.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie crawls into the car through the slit. He takes both guards' guns, and the keys to the car and the handcuffs. He drags the unconscious Jackson out of the trunk and throws her over one shoulder.<br/><br/>From the sky comes a curious thudding noise--<i>thup thup thup thup</i>. Never having heard the sound of a helicopter before, Freddie shrugs and looks for a place to hide. The sound of sirens can be heard, coming closer.<br/><br/>He dashes through the Prole section of town and swings into an alleyway. A small carriage house, converted into an apartment seems to offer refuge. He bursts through the door.<br/><br/>A pleasant looking old man is talking into a telescreen. "You may as well say good-bye. And by the way, while we are on the subject, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to-- who the hell are you?" he says, turning to face Freddie.<br/><br/>The picture on the screen is of two naked people standing back to back, with looks of terror.<br/><br/>"Who the hell are you?" repeats the man.<br/><br/>"I'm O'Brien."<br/><br/>"<i>You're</i> O'Brien? What are you doing here? There's a platoon of Thought Police on their way."<br/><br/>"Turn off the screen, damnit! I know all that! This is all O'Shaughnessy's doing--he's starting a coup."<br/><br/>"I think I need to call this in..."<br/><br/>Freddie shoots him. The old man drops to the floor.<br/><br/>As Freddie ties the man up, the man and woman from the telescreen come downstairs, wrapped in a blanket. "We were getting arrested by the Thought Police..." says the man. He is holding a huge book.<br/><br/>"What are your names?"<br/><br/>"I'm Winston, and this is Julia."<br/><br/>"Ridiculous names. You'd best come with us."<br/><br/>"Is that General Jeremias?"<br/><br/>"Yes, and I'm O'Brien."<br/><br/>"You're not O'Brien! I <i>know</i> O'Brien!"<br/><br/>"Did you think there's only one O'Brien in all of Oceania?"<br/><br/>As Freddie revives Jax, Julia comes downstairs, dressed in her coveralls. She looks curiously at Freddie, and then sharply. She takes a coin out of her pocket and stares at it, and at Freddie. "With a mustache...and a little older...it can't be..." she mutters.<br/><br/>"Where are we?" says Jackson.<br/><br/>"Some house. The Thought Police are on their way. Where should we go?"<br/><br/>"I know where to go, but you won't like it."<br/><br/>"Is it my Aunts' house?"<br/><br/>"No, no. You had your aunts liquidated--one of the first things you did as Chairman. The Ministry. Where my people will be able to help us, if it's not too late."<br/><br/>She places a call, and soon a black car rolls up. Freddie hands her his gun. "Not terribly fond of these things."<br/><br/>"Neither am I," she says, buckling it on.<br/><br/>"I just ask one thing, Jax. If you shoot me, try not to do it slowly."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419376/#Comment_419376" name="Item_206" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T12:11:42+00:00" title="August  1, 2013 12:11PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"Is it my Aunts' house?"<br/><br/>"No, no.

He finds a local high school, and counting on being pegged as a janitor if anyone sees him, he breaks in and steals some history texts.<br/><br/>By the time he gets back to Cousin Wu's, the doctor is finishing his exam. "You need ginseng," the doctor says to Noor, "and probably chemotherapy."<br/><br/>"Do you know what's wrong with her?"<br/><br/>"I can't tell. I'd really like to get her to a hospital."<br/><br/>"Is that possible?"<br/><br/>"Do you have your papers?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Then it's probably not a good idea."<br/><br/>"So I guess I need to get some papers."<br/><br/>"Do not worry about me," croaks Noor. "I will be fine."<br/><br/><br/><br/>They dig into the textbooks. Apparently there was a <i>second</i> President Roosevelt. But he got assassinated in Miami in 1940.<br/><br/><i>[The official divergence in </i>The Man in the High Castle<i> from our timeline.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston flips through one of the books. "Hey, there's that guy from the nightclub! Turns out he became dictator of Germany. Before going nuts from syphilis." According to the newspapers, Hitler's successor Martin Bormann is on the verge of dying, and a power struggle is about to start between Dr. Goebbels and the head of security, Reinhard Heydrich.<br/><br/>On the recommendation of the guys at the laundry, Charleston heads into the white section of town. He finds a small tailor shop run by what is obviously a Jewish former New Yorker--obvious to Charleston, at least, who lived near the Lower East Side.<br/><br/>The man puts down the book he is reading, a novel called <i>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</i>. Charleston had noticed people reading that book before, but there wasn't a copy in the high school, and the bookstore he stopped at on the way told him it was banned by the Japanese.<br/><br/>So he stole a copy from somebody on the trolley.<br/><br/>The storekeeper puts the book down and covers it with his thick copy of the <i>I Ching</i>--the <i>other</i> book Charleston had noticed everybody carrying around.<br/><br/>"Hello there. My name is Frank Jones."<br/><br/>"Sure it is. Nice shop."<br/><br/>"It is a tailor shop."<br/><br/>"I could use some clothes. And papers."<br/><br/>"We don't do papers here. But why don't you take a look at my dry cleaning fees." He hands Charleston a small book. Inside are the prices listed for a variety of documents--ranging from ration books (relatively cheap) to passports (prohibitively expensive."<br/><br/>"What would I need to get into a hospital?" asks Charleston.<br/><br/>"Hm. Well, it would help if you were born in the Pacific States instead of China. American citizens have <i>slightly</i> more rights."<br/><br/>"She's an Arab."<br/><br/>"Really? I didn't think there were many of those left."<br/><br/>"She could be <i>Indian</i>, you know."<br/><br/>"Ah. That would make you both citizens of the the Greater Pacific Co-Prosperity Sphere...she's not Japanese, you're not Japanese...I could make you both Americans, give you some work papers...that at least makes you eligible for health care.

CP does this kind of thing of lot--he likes to joke around (and has a bottomless supply of execrable puns), but he does some very subtle touches with his roleplaying. He made his abrasive goblin wizard (with the charisma of 5) both believably self-sabotaging socially but never a pain in the ass to be around.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston returns to the house. Noor is sitting up in bed, reading. "We should be able to get you into a hospital in three days or so," he tells her.<br/><br/>"That is good." She sighs and closes a book.

It's very busy, filled with a high-end clientele. Charleston recognizes the setup immediately from his experiences in other mob-owned clubs.<br/><br/>The front is filled with young, well-to-do Japanese people. Some come in costumes as "classic American types" like cowboys. The occasional wealthy and sycophantic American can also be found there.<br/><br/>The real nightclub is where the hip rich Japanese hang out, grooving to American "folk music". VIP barriers keep the strivers out while giving them a tantalizing glimpse of what lies beyond.<br/><br/>Behind that is the Triad den, filled with tough-looking characters--all the members of the gang, except for a few who hang around the entrance to give the place some ambiance.<br/><br/>Charleston is led into the private suite, kept atmospherically dark. He parks himself on a couch, and the servants give him his favorite drink--orange juice--without having to be asked.<br/><br/>After a long while, an elderly Chinese man, wearing traditional robes, enters the room and sits down, shadows obscuring his face. A younger man in a business suit stands next to him. The old man begins speaking in rapid Shanghailese, with such a thick accent that Charleston can barely follow him.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the man in the suit translates. "It has been so long since I spoke English regularly that I brought my man with me. I was very interested in how you took care of the problem last night. It immediately drew my interest, because it reminded me of what I would have done when I was a young man."<br/><br/><i>[FP: It's you! You're talking to you!]</i><br/><br/>The old man leans forward. His features resemble Charleston's--with the addition of some forty years.<br/><br/><i>[Dancer--from "the Charleston", and Lee, from the name of the Triad family he worked for.]</i><br/><br/>"My only question is, how is this possible that you are here?"<br/><br/>"Well, I took a cab down here, and there were these lovely young people out front..."<br/><br/>"Ah yes, I remember being as you are, when I was young. Before I had responsibilities. Of course, now that I <i>have</i> responsibilities, I tend to torture people who talk back to me. It's what Mr. Lee taught us, after all."<br/><br/>"He taught me nothing! He threw me out!"<br/><br/>"Ah. That is not what I remember."<br/><br/>Charleston rolls up his sleeve, showing his Triad brands, and the symbol cancelling his membership in the family. Dancer nods, and rolls his own sleeves up, showing an unblemished brand.<br/><br/><i>[Before the campaign began, I ran CP and PP through a CoC session where we did "Dead Man Stomp". It was the first time Charleston met Jackson Elias, and ended with her getting shot and him kicked out of the Triad. In this world, "Dancer" never met Jax, and thus stayed in the Triad.]</i><br/><br/>"It's been so long since I left New York that I barely remember it."<br/><br/>"Really? Feels like I left only three months ago."<br/><br/>"I had to leave everything there. My wife did not make it out."<br/><br/>"Your wife?"<br/><br/>"Yes. The Germans were not kind to many people. Especially black women."<br/><br/><i>[Charleston has a crush on Bertha, the owner of a Harlem diner.]</i><br/><br/>Dancer leans back. "I would normally say you are an impossible thing, but there have been many impossible things happening of late." He brings out a copy of <i>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</i>. "Do you know this book?"<br/><br/>"Just got a copy. Haven't had a chance to read it. What's it about?"<br/><br/>"A world where the United States and England did not lose World War Two."<br/><br/>"I still don't get that war."<br/><br/>"As it turns out, it is hard to keep a bad German down. And the Japanese went insane for a while, until the War Cabinet fell. Now matters are worse. Both sides have nuclear weapons now..."<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"Bombs that can destroy a city. The Germans invented them first. Uses the power of the atom. There are enough between Germany and Japan to destroy all life on this planet. Of course, you'd have to be crazy to want to do that--but the Germans are crazy."<br/><br/>"Look, I'm just trying to get some work."<br/><br/>"I have a mission for you. You will need papers. I will tell our tailor to hurry. You're going to need a travel pass."<br/><br/>"I'm traveling?"<br/><br/>"Yes. To Colorado. I want you to meet with a man named Hawthorne Abendsen."<br/><br/>"Who's that?"<br/><br/>"The man who wrote this book. I want you to find out why he wrote the book, and how he wrote the book. You are familiar with the Book of Changes?"<br/><br/>"My mom used to use it sometimes..."<br/><br/>"I remember. It has become customary in San Francisco to consult the oracle frequently. I asked the oracle once, 'Why was this book written?' I will write down what it said." He scribbles something on a paper, then seals it in an envelope and hands it to Charleston. "Ask the author why he wrote the book, and then give him that."<br/><br/>"As you know, this is a bit outside my skill set. I suppose I should report back when I'm done?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"So this is a mission I'm <i>supposed</i> to come back from, then?"<br/><br/>"Ah. Yes, yes it is."<br/><br/>"May I be so bold as to ask you a question? What other interesting books have you come across?"<br/><br/>"I'm not much of a reader.

Maturin told me I shouldn't take you with me, but I told him to get stuffed."<br/><br/>"I'm a strange man who's going to win you this battle."<br/><br/>"Very good then."<br/><br/>With a colossal thud what is left of the undersized frigate plows into <i>Constitution</i>. Pearkes swings across to the American ship. As he lands, an American tries to take off his head with a marlinspike. Pearkes ducks and then swings the Sword of Akmallah at him, slashing his head from his shoulders, and then with a backhand stroke beheads the man's nearest companion.<br/><br/>Aubrey looks over. His jaw drops for a moment, and then he waves Pearkes forward.<br/><br/>George dashes for the quaterdeck, leaping up on the rail to dodge past the throng of American sailors. The mighty Sword sweeps out again, beheading two more sailors. A sharpshooter from the maintop wings Pearkes as he runs forward.<br/><br/><i>[Bunch of athletics checks and weapons checks here by PP; I was letting him behead any mooks he ran across.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes glances back. Aubrey is surrounded by the Americans, but they keep a respectful distance from the bearish Englishman, bleeding from many wounds.<br/><br/>"It's a masterpiece!" exults Pearkes as he swings up to the quarterdeck on a rope. He sees a man in a large hat dash down into the cabin. Some officers raise their hands up as Pearkes slashes viciously at them, and four more heads roll to the deck.<br/><br/>Pearkes leaps down the stairs. A shot rings out, catching him in the shoulder and spinning him around.<br/><br/><i>[4 points of damage dropped him to -3, and then he spent one on the roll to stay conscious.]</i><br/><br/>The door slams shut behind him. The captain turns around slowly.<br/><br/>"Pearksie! Good to see you." says N.<br/><br/>Pearkes shoots him. Nyarlathotep catches the bullet in his hand. "Seriously?" he says.<br/><br/>"Seriously! This is it?

Why do I do anything?"<br/><br/>"A question I ask myself," mutters Pearkes.<br/><br/>"So you don't want to leave."<br/><br/>"I don't want to come work for you. So why don't we just quit now, you send me back to where I'm from, and we'll call it even."<br/><br/>"Yeaaaah...and why would I want to do that for you?"<br/><br/>"Because if you're going to play around with my life you might as well do it in my own time.

For <i>realsies</i>? You'll give me that sword?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"You think you can?"<br/><br/>"I don't know! You're the Outer God, and you're asking the mortal questions?"<br/><br/>"You want to go home...ok. And you want to give me the sword...ok. I can do that deal.

Fine. Congratulations. You're home!"<br/><br/>Pearkes finds himself in the middle of a sandstorm, still dressed in his bloodstained 19th century infantry uniform. He begins to dig a shelter.

After a long wait, a man enters the office.<br/><br/>"Good day, Comrade General. And to you, Mr. Blakely," says O'Shaughnessy. He turns to face Freddie.<br/><br/>Freddie stares into the features of Omar Shakhti.<br/><br/>"Oh for God's sake," he mutters.<br/><br/>"We don't say 'God' here."<br/><br/>"Yes, yes, all right.

There seems to be an inexhaustible supply of them."<br/><br/>"Oh, but these are my guards."<br/><br/>"How can you tell? They look exactly alike!"<br/><br/>"A shepherd can recognize his flock.

Freddie and Jax are strapped to tables and wired up to strange machinery. Shakhti stands on an elevated platform, next to a large dial.<br/><br/>He turns the dial slightly. Freddie feels horrible pain course through every nerve in his body. "Aagh!"<br/><br/>"Ah, you cried out. But would you cry out if I did this?" He turns the dial again, and Jackson shrieks in agony. "We're going to try this again.

"I don't know whether to believe you or not."<br/><br/>"I'm just an Outer God asking some questions is all."<br/><br/>"Well, we seem to be at an impasse, since you can do whatever you bloody well wish--"<br/><br/>"It really doesn't work that way. I can't just do 'whatever I bloody well wish.'"<br/><br/>"From my extremely limited perspective."<br/><br/>"Yes! That's correct. Anyway, in about 30 seconds they'll come through the door, this time with the equipment they need to keep you alive. That is, unless you want to do something about it."<br/><br/>"Well, then I hope the door opens and I'm back in Arabia."<br/><br/>"Well, that's what you <i>want</i>. What are you going to do?"<br/><br/>"I'll crawl through the door, since apparently I can't walk."<br/><br/>"Right. Well, see you in the funny papers, then, Freddie."<br/><br/>The door opens. N is no longer there. <br/><br/>"Room 101," says a guard. They frogmarch Freddie down to the subterranean room. Jackson is strapped to the other bed. She's clearly been beaten.<br/><br/>"Hullo, Jax. Apparently they're torturing you to torture me. It's terribly exciting."<br/><br/>Shakhti comes out onto the platform. "We're all here again."<br/><br/>"This seems to be some kind of personal torture device," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Yes?"<br/><br/>"Well, the question is, are you torturing me, or torturing Jax?"<br/><br/>"Let's find out, shall we?"<br/><br/>"I think you're torturing me," stage whispers Freddie.<br/><br/>"That's an interesting theory," says Shakhti as he cranks the machine over again.<br/><br/><i>[Round the mulberry bush again. FP tries to spend 11; again I don't insist he explain how (why? WHY?) but have them revive him immediately and then wire him into some medical equipment. (This was getting stupid on both sides now.) FP then asks for a First Aid spend to kill himself. I ask how, and he says he bites through his tongue.<br/><br/>Step back. FP was basically trying not to be in the torture scene. But why? THAT was a better question to ask here; was it because he didn't want to do a torture scene, didn't like Freddie being put on the spot, or because he was trying to win D&amp;D?  It's hard to say, which is why I should have asked. We both got caught up in a kind of "simulationist endless loop" where rather than using our superior tools to manipulate the fiction--the ones Trail of Cthulhu explicitly provides--we fell back into the deadly step by step insertion of details familiar to anybody who's played traditional games, especially ones with their roots in 1st gen RPGs.<br/><br/>I'm going to explicitly ask people not to do this next time, and pay attention myself (I hope).<br/><br/>I beat myself up quite a bit in this thread, mostly because I really care about doing this as well as possible; this is an art for me, a sometimes serious one. That said, I'm doing something right; CP continues to show up even though he hates Gumshoe, it seems. This is me watching the game-day film, and fretting over each missed tackle or wayward ball or insert your physical metaphor of choice here.]</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420083/#Comment_420083" name="Item_214" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T20:50:42+00:00" title="August 14, 2013  8:50PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2013 8:51PM by Aviatrix.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: The Windmills of Your Mind (Part 14)</b><br/><br/>Freddie wakes up in a hospital room again.

His hands are a swollen ruin, clearly untreated.<br/><br/>"Ah, Freddie," says Shakhti, "we were trying to play nice with you--do things in a civilized manner."<br/><br/>"No, you're trying to torture me and break my spirit."<br/><br/>"Yes, but in a civilized manner."<br/><br/>"Just get on with it, Shakhti."<br/><br/>"Yes, normally I'm supposed to get you to believe in the Party and everything, but I really don't care."

To the disappointment of both, no spell that they try and cast work. This is puzzling to them both.<br/><br/>There's a knock on the door. Charleston lets in a man who hands him a package. "I was told to deliver this."<br/><br/>"Thank you. This is for your trouble."<br/><br/>He hands the man a few coins. When the man looks up, his face has changed to that of the being they call N.<br/><br/>"Two cents? Seriously?"<br/><br/>"Why, what did you expect?"<br/><br/>"I expect a lot more from you, Chuckles. Wanna chat?"<br/><br/>"What do you want?"<br/><br/>"Just making my rounds, checking up on everyone. How do you like this place? How's the magic working?"<br/><br/>"Great! I can make a card appear here, a card appear there, a coin come out of your ear..."<br/><br/>"Pro tip: if you're going to lie to people, learn to shield your mind from telepathy. Only one spell is going to work here."<br/><br/>"First, I demand my two cents back."<br/><br/>"Fine."<br/><br/>Charleston starts to choke. Eventually he manages to dislodge the penny that suddenly appeared in his trachea.<br/><br/>"I hurt you because I love you the most. You're the one who understands." <br/><br/>There is a popping noise, and suddenly they are standing on top of Mount Diablo, some 60 miles from San Francisco.<br/><br/>"So how's it been going?" asks N.<br/><br/>"All right. There was a thing with a bomb, and I met a very near relative, which was a trip. Frankly, I don't know which of us is better off."<br/><br/>"He's a big time gangster."<br/><br/>"Gangster--who cares? That's not what matters."<br/><br/>"Exactly! You get it! Pearkes would never understand that."<br/><br/>"Yeah. Though really, there's not a lot of room left up in my brain. I have to start writing things down to remember them. I'm lucky I remember that!"<br/><br/>"I could fix that--your brain, that is. Of course, you wouldn't really be human anymore..."<br/><br/>"That's okay. Is there a bench? Someplace to sit down?"<br/><br/>"Sure." N snaps his fingers, and Charleston finds himself on the observation deck of a very tall building, taller than the nearby Empire State Building. (He doesn't recognize it, of course, because it hasn't been built in his time yet.) Out in New York Harbor, where the Statue of Liberty used to stand, is a statue of Adolf Hitler giving the Nazi salute.<br/><br/>"Hey, there's that Hitler guy."<br/><br/>"Yeah, he's a chum. Welcome to Todt Tower, built by Albert Speer's guys. What's your plan?"<br/><br/>"I was going to head out to Colorado."<br/><br/>"I don't think you should do that."<br/><br/>"See, now it sounds interesting."<br/><br/>"You know, I was probably very much like you once."<br/><br/>"See, that's the thing about a good memory. You spend too much time thinking of the past."<br/><br/>"You're right. Let's live in the moment. Pearksie and Blakely have both found their way home."<br/><br/>"Home is wherever I find myself."<br/><br/>"Can't argue with a man who knows himself. So, you ready to come work for me?"<br/><br/>"Work? See, I was thinking of finding somebody to think they were in charge and give me an excuse to go places and make things go wrong."<br/><br/>"Yeah, work."<br/><br/>"See, I'm not sure that I could work for somebody who always knows when I'm lying."<br/><br/>"Just have to learn to shield your mind."<br/><br/>"But then you won't know if I'm really working for you, will you?"<br/><br/>"Everybody ends up working for me eventually, especially when they try to do magic."<br/><br/>"I can do magic!" says Charleston, flipping a deck of cards between his hands.<br/><br/>N holds out a palm. The cards fly through the air and land in a neat stack in his hand. As they skate past his eyes, Charleston sees N's face on every one, strobing through an animation of him making a rude gesture.<br/><br/>"So..." says N, "you are going to come work for me?"<br/><br/>"It's just not a job offer that's particularly enticing for me."<br/><br/>"Let me spice it up for you then." <br/><br/>He throws Charleston off the side of the building.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420157/#Comment_420157" name="Item_216" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T19:46:54+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  7:46PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: The Windmills of Your Mind (Part 16)</b><br/><br/><i>Somewhere in the 1960s...</i><br/><br/>"Aaaaaaah," says Charleston, immediately grabbing the ledge and holding himself up easily.<br/><br/>"That would be harder to do with no hands."<br/><br/>"And easier with three hands!" He scrambles back up to the deck.<br/><br/>"All right. I guess somebody around here has to have free will," says N.<br/><br/>"Two cents, sir?" asks the messenger. Charleston glances around.<br/><br/>He's back in Noor's room.<br/><br/>"You know what? Here's a dollar bill. No more hard objects."<br/><br/>Noor is sitting up in bed. She closes her book. "I think I am too tired to read any more, Charleston."<br/><br/>"That's all right. Say, you interested in a job? I hear someone's recruiting; just not a good fit for me now."<br/><br/>"I think I'm too sick to do any work."<br/><br/>"I'm sure medical treatment is included."<br/><br/>"Could we talk about this later?"<br/><br/>"Sure...sure. Just keep it in the back of your head."<br/><br/><i>[Assess Honesty tells CP that Noor is lying about something, but he doesn't know what.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Later that night Charleston is finished getting ready for his trip to Colorado, now that his travel papers have arrived. He goes upstairs to get Noor, so that he can take her to the hospital. She is sitting in bed, with a book on her lap.<br/><br/>"Oh, I was just reading," she says. Charleston looks around. <br/><br/>The room is pitch dark.<br/><br/>"Can you help me out of the bed?"<br/><br/>"Sure, sure." He lets her stand up slowly and put her weight on him. "Where are we off to next?"<br/><br/>"I don't know...I haven't been able to figure anything more out. Can you help me down the stairs?"<br/><br/>"Of course." He notices that she is having trouble walking. As they reach the top of the stairs, she trips and begins to fall. Charleston nimbly grabs her, noticing that she tripped because she didn't seem to know the stair was there.<br/><br/>"What do you see now, Noor?"<br/><br/>"I don't see anything at all, Charleston. I am blind."<br/><br/>"How were you reading, then?"<br/><br/>"I was pretending. I didn't want you to be worried."<br/><br/>"I would have read to you, Noor. Nothing should get in the way of the research. I'll take you to the hospital--they'll make you right as rain. Or you could take that job offer..."<br/><br/>"Who would I be working for?"<br/><br/>"Ah....that person we met at the party, before we got here..."<br/><br/>"Oh. That's not so good, is it."<br/><br/>"Well, Noor, it looks like your hands are tied here. The hospital could perhaps delay the inevitable."<br/><br/>"Why don't you not take me to the hospital? Take me with you instead."<br/><br/>"If that's your decision."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420158/#Comment_420158" name="Item_217" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T19:47:47+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  7:47PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: The Windmills of Your Mind (Part 17)</b><br/><br/><i>Somewhere in the 1960s...</i><br/><br/>They motor out into the darkness, fleeing San Francisco, driving through the dawn up into the Sierra Nevada, winding down the narrow and poorly-maintained mountain roads. Morning finds them burning across the Nevada desert. Somewhere east of Salt Lake City they cross the frontier into the Rocky Mountain States. Around 10 pm, Charleston finally stops in a motel just south of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Inside the packet from Dancer he finds an address, and he consults his map while huge trucks roar by on their way east down the German-built autobahns.<br/><br/>According to the back flap of <i>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</i>, Hawthorne Abendsen lives in a fortress, surrounded by barbed wire and machine gun emplacements. But the address Charleston drives to the next morning turns out to be an ordinary suburban house. Shrugging, wakes Noor up and wraps a shawl around her.<br/><br/>"Put your head on my shoulder," he says, grabbing his violin case and leading them up to the front door. He knocks on the door.<br/><br/>A red-headed woman cracks open the door. "I don't know you," she says.<br/><br/>"Greetings..."<br/><br/>She slams the door shut.<br/><br/>Charleston knocks again.<br/><br/>The door cracks open. "I have a gun," the woman says.<br/><br/>Charleston holds up his copy of <i>Grasshopper</i>. "I want to talk to the author of this book."<br/><br/>"Lots of people want to talk to Hawthorne. Why should I let you in?"<br/><br/>"What reason would you like to hear?"<br/><br/>She slams the door shut again.<br/><br/>Charleston knocks for several minutes.<br/><br/>"WHAT!" screams the woman, yanking open the door until it catches on the chain.<br/><br/>"I just started reading this book yesterday and I'm impressed with the market penetration it's made!"<br/><br/>SLAM!<br/><br/>"Seriously!" shouts Charleston. "I feel I know what is going to happen in that book without even reading it!"<br/><br/>Pause. <br/><br/>There is the sound of a latch being lifted.<br/><br/>The door creaks open. "What's your name," says the woman, leveling her shotgun at him.<br/><br/>"Charleston. Are you the author?"<br/><br/>"No, I'm his wife."<br/><br/>"Did you read the book?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Did you like it?"<br/><br/>"I think--I think Hawthorne found a happier place for us all to be. It's just a shame it's not true. You're a very strange person, aren't you? Anyway, come in."<br/><br/>"Thank you. Come on, Noor."<br/><br/>"What happened to your friend?"<br/><br/>"She got sick, and then blind. She's Indian--wait, I'm in the Rocky Mountain States? an Arab. Egyptian."<br/><br/>"Oh. Didn't think there were many of them left around. I always wanted to visit Egypt, but never got there before the war, and now..."<br/><br/>She leads them through a rather kitschy living room and into a stereotypical writer's study. Paper and typescripts litter a desk next to a manual typewriter; handsome bookshelves fill every wall.<br/><br/>A man enters, smoking a cigarette. "Caroline said I should talk to you."<br/><br/><i>[Actually, I didn't remember the name of Abendsen's wife, so I used Virginia in play--based on my suspicion that the character of Abendsen is based on Robert A. Heinlein.]</i><br/><br/>"By the way, she know how to use that thing?"<br/><br/>"Yeah."<br/><br/>"You've got yourself quite a lady. Tell me, did you write any other books?"<br/><br/>"I wrote some science fiction." He gestures to a shelf of paperbacks near his desk. <br/><br/>"I see. You don't consider this book science fiction?"<br/><br/>"Well, now, that's an interesting question: is alternate history science fiction, or not?"<br/><br/><i>[Bill, if you're still reading this: I swear to God, Valis, and Horselover Fat that I did </i>nothing<i> to prep that question. I don't know how CP managed to recreate, without even having ever</i> heard <i>of the book, one of its most famous and post-modern/meta scenes. I suspect pink lasers may have been involved.]</i><br/><br/>"I don't know--you're the author."<br/><br/>"It's a question of genre, not authorship."<br/><br/>"Genre is something for marketing to think about. What do <i>you</i> think about it?"<br/><br/>"That's a very interesting question. I...think it's very philosophical."<br/><br/>"Yeah? Well, as I was telling your wife, I feel like I know what's going to happen even though I didn't read it."<br/><br/>"It's very popular, I'm sure you heard about the plot..."<br/><br/>"Well, I feel like I've been there. New York, post-war. I don't even think  we were headed to a second war."<br/><br/>"I don't know about that..."<br/><br/>"Ever been to Egypt? In my mind, it's still there. In fact, it was like I was there just a few weeks ago."<br/><br/>"You're really not making a lot of sense, so I'm having a drink." He pours himself a glass of Canadian scotch.<br/><br/>"I love Canadian scotch. Noor, you want some?"<br/><br/>"It is forbidden to my relig--yes."<br/><br/>"I'm sure it will help with the pain. I assume there's some pain?"<br/><br/>"Yes, quite a bit actually--"<br/><br/>Charleston turns back to Hawthorne. "So why exactly did you write this book?"<br/><br/>"In a way I didn't. I used the <i>I Ching</i>. Whenever I had to make a decision or had a question, I would consult the oracle."<br/><br/>"Never trusted that thing when I was a kid."<br/><br/>"I never knew about it when I was a kid. So we're even. What can I do for you, anyway?"<br/><br/>"I was sent here to ask you why you wrote it. Before you even used the <i>I Ching</i>, what made you want to write this book, this story?" <br/><br/>"I was just looking for an idea, and I started to use the oracle."<br/><br/>"So the <i>I Ching</i> told you to write a book? A book about the Allies winning? Why did it ask you to do that?"<br/><br/>"I asked the oracle that very question once. I found the answer to be...disturbing."<br/><br/>"What was the answer it gave?"<br/><br/>"Why are you here? Who sent you?"<br/><br/>"Dancer Lee."<br/><br/>"Don't know him."<br/><br/>"Then the question doesn't matter, does it? You know, for a book that's so popular, I'm surprised more people don't come here to ask you questions."<br/><br/>"Why don't you ask the oracle? I have some yarrow sticks here."<br/><br/>It takes Charleston a while, but when he is done, the hexagram is the one called Inner Truth.<br/><br/>"Inner Truth--the craziest lie of all!"<br/><br/>"That's not how I interpreted that at all."<br/><br/>"How did you interpret it?"<br/><br/>"That the United States didn't lose the war."<br/><br/>"Is that the truth, or what the oracle believes? What made you decide to believe it and not your eyes?"<br/><br/>"The feeling I got."<br/><br/>"What feeling is that?"<br/><br/>"Well...it was like waking up."<br/><br/>"Sounds terrible."<br/><br/>"I don't know. You seem like a pretty wide-awake guy. You're not from around here, are you?"<br/><br/>"No. I'm from New York."<br/><br/>"That's not what I meant. When Caroline said someone was here, I used the oracle. It said something about meeting a stranger from beyond the threshold. And that it was ok to pass through the door."<br/><br/>"By the way, Dancer Lee has a letter for you to read, after I asked him about the book."<br/><br/>Hawthorne opens it. "Yeah, that's right." He hands it back to Charleston.<br/><br/>On the page, in his own handwriting, is the hexagram for Inner Truth.<br/><br/>"You understand now, don't you?" says Abendsen, quietly. "Is there anything else I can do for you?"<br/><br/>"Did you ever think about writing a sequel?"<br/><br/>"There's no need to. I know what the truth is."<br/><br/><i>[Curse you Valis! Of course, Phillip K. Dick planned a sequel to </i>The Man in the High Castle<i> but famously never wrote it. Again, not that CP would know.]</i><br/><br/>"And you differentiate between truth and reality?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. I think I do. It's probably safer if you leave out the back way."<br/><br/>"What do you anticipate being out the front door?"<br/><br/>"The book's not popular in the Reich."<br/><br/>"We're not in the Reich."<br/><br/>"Border doesn't really stop the Gestapo."<br/><br/>Noor and Charleston stand up.

Eventually he stumbles on Pearkes' shelter and together with Freddie they wait the storm out.<br/><br/><i>Saturday, 11 April 1925</i><br/><br/>They catch each other up on their various adventures. Charleston and Freddie are surprised that Pearkes gave up the Sword of Akmallah, although Freddie is relieved, figuring it was only a matter of time before George used it on them.<br/><br/><i>[At this point I charged everyone a point of Sanity for the whole experience.]</i><br/><br/>After some searching, they find their camp, or what is left of it. Abd' al-Qazim is sitting on the hood of the halftrack, smoking. "Hey, kindly master, you're not dead."<br/><br/>"No, just tortured."<br/><br/>Charleston loads Noor into the touring car. She wakes up, her vision restored but weaker. They drive out to the Bedouin camp, where they rest for a few days, healing up. They make a gift of the halftrack and Russian weapons to the Bedouin as thanks for their hospitality. Then they set out for Aden, hoping to catch a boat to either Europe or Shanghai. On they way, the call at the weather station.<br/><br/><i>[CP, to FP: You're living the backstory to Dr. Strange, you know.]</i><br/><br/>It has been burnt to the ground. Sheila and Mwimbe are still there, but the Aussie and Maxwell the pilot, along with Wazim and Qusay have been killed by raiders; Mwimbe speculates they were in the employ of Shakhti.<br/><br/>"Sorry about your father, Noor," says Charleston. He helps her to Wazim's grave; her health is returning, but her illness has left her permanently weakened.<br/><br/>"You could bring him back."<br/><br/>"I could. You know I could. You knew that before you asked. You know what that would be like, though, don't you?"<br/><br/>"You're right, of course. I just would have liked to see him once more..."<br/><br/>On the way to Aden, Freddie seeks out Charleston. "You know, I found out in that other time that the great love of my life had me killed."<br/><br/>"Interesting. You say you think it was all a lucid dream, right?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"This is easy then. It was symbolism--you feel incredibly guilty about her death."<br/><br/>"That does make sense. The whole thing was full of literary symbolism. Needed rather a better author."<br/><br/><i>[CP had bought a point of Psychoanalysis, so this was his first chance to treat somebody with it.]</i><br/><br/><i>Tuesday, 21 April 1925</i><br/><br/>Eventually they reach Aden. They are stopped by a local patrol. He speaks in Arabic to them. Freddie suddenly realizes that he no longer understands Arabic.<br/><br/><i>[In the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zse0mU3VVcISCf-hGc4bOCMwWKroRQp5-4eh1utL1o0/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">journal</a> I wrote in character as Jackson, she described gradually losing her ability to speak other languages.]</i><br/><br/>"Oh, you are English! I apologize for addressing you in a language other than English. Your passports, please."<br/><br/>"I'm afraid I was waylaid, and have neither."<br/><br/>"Then I'm afraid I must turn you away," says the guard, rubbing his hands together.<br/><br/>"Let me show you some more interesting papers," says Charleston.<br/><br/>Low on cash now, Freddie goes looking for a telegraph station to set up a credit account. He also sends a telegram to the Foreign Office in London: <br/><br/>"DEAR AUNTIE EM HAVE JUST GOT BACK FROM FUTURE STOP SPOKEN TO MR N STOP MISS H IS NOT WITH MR S STOP"<br/><br/>However, when he goes to the bank, he discovers that the account he wanted to draw from was lower in funds than he expected. They give him some cash, and he has George and Charleston drive him back to the hotel they are staying at.<br/><br/>As they pull up to the hotel, George can see two men in suits talking to the desk clerk. He looks out the door, and points at Freddie.<br/><br/>Pearkes puts the car back in gear and starts to drive away.<br/><br/>"What the--" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"We're going to find a different hotel."<br/><br/>The two men in suits dash out of the front of the hotel. "Stop in the name of the British Empire!" one shouts.<br/><br/>Pearkes slams on the brakes and backs up.<br/><br/>"Freddie Blakely?" asks one of them. "I'm afraid I must ask you to come with us back to the Embassy."<br/><br/>"What for?" demands Pearkes.<br/><br/>"Military Intelligence wants to have a word with him."<br/><br/>"That's all right," says Freddie. "I work for you chaps."<br/><br/>"We have a legal warrant," says the agent, "from the Ministry of Defense, saying we are to bring Blakely in for questioning."<br/><br/>Pearkes looks over the orders. He notes that in fact what they say is that they are to bring Freddie in for questioning, and then <i>hold him for deportation</i>.<br/><br/>"We won't be able to join you at the Embassy," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"Our orders are not discretionary."<br/><br/>"You should never address your superiors in such a manner," says Pearkes. "Mr. Blakely is in my custody, and we will deliver him to you tomorrow. Cheerio."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by PP.]</i><br/><br/>"Eight o' clock <i>sharp</i>," says the agent, cowed.<br/><br/>"I'll be there at 10," says Freddie. "We're not uncivilized. I give you my word as a gentleman."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery spend by FP.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie decides to call his lawyer, Bradley Grey, back in New York, despite the 10 hour time difference. It takes about an hour, but eventually the connection is made.<br/><br/>"Hullo...who's calling me at this hour?"<br/><br/>"Dorian old boy!"<br/><br/>"Oh for God's SAKE, Freddie!"<br/><br/>"How's that political race going?"<br/><br/>"It's going to go great. I'm going to be a great DA."<br/><br/>"You aren't doing anything this morning?"<br/><br/>"I'm sleeping."<br/><br/>"Excellent. I seem to be in a spot of trouble with British Military Intelligence."<br/><br/>"I could call some people."<br/><br/>"Good. Contact me in Aden! Abigail is right here, she'll give you the details."<br/><br/>Several hours later, Grey calls Freddie at the hotel bar.<br/><br/>"You know how late I was up yesterday? Political fundraisers don't just happen. By the way, I'm charging you for this call, and the two--no, four--hours of work I just did.<br/><br/>"Here's the deal. There's a private Bill in Parliament to strip you of your citizenship."<br/><br/>"Why don't they just ask Rollie's father to do it?"<br/><br/>"They want it above board. I don't have any details yet, just that Baldwin is letting it go through. I don't know why--apparently, there's some political muscle behind it.<br/><br/>"The other thing is--there hasn't been a legal Bill of Attainder passed in Commons in over six hundred years. So they won't attain your estate. However, they will charge you a fine and back taxes that will bankrupt you. I spoke with your man of business in London. He's trying to liquidate as much as possible and move it overseas, but I'm afraid your options aren't great. You're in a British port right now?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"They're going to seize your passport, stranding you there. I'll see what I can do at State--your best bet is to get a passport from a neutral country, like the U. S. It would probably help you if you could get to England, to see if you can convince some people to support you--but you better either win, or have another way out; they'll definitely keep you from leaving the country. Meanwhile, get a passport, from a neutral country willing to stand up to the British."<br/><br/>Freddie explains this to the others. "Maybe I could get a Russian passport?" he wonders.<br/><br/>"There's a better option," says Charleston. "The Germans."<br/><br/>"I don't know anyone in Germany."<br/><br/>"You don't need to. You just need to pay someone in Germany."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420318/#Comment_420318" name="Item_219" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T19:16:07+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  7:16PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yes, I am paying attention.

I had an idea of having N bring Charleston to a future street where he would look in the window of a house to see a group very much like our own playing a role-playing game, but I decided to back off that idea. In any case, it would have been easier had my idea of having Gilbert tie together the various fictions come to fruition--I had to kill that idea when GP didn't show up.<br/><br/>But hey, no time like the present--so I threw some coins and came up with:<br/><br/>#58: Tui--the Joyous, Lake with a moving line in the fifth place going to <br/>#54: Kuei Mei--The Marrying Maiden<br/><br/>Here's the Wilhelm for the moving lines:<br/><br/><i><br/>58:\t\xb0 Nine in the fifth place means:<br/>\tSincerity toward disintegrating influences is dangerous.<br/><br/>Dangerous elements approach even the far best of men. If a man permits <br/>himself to have anything to do with them, their disintegrating influence acts <br/>slowly but surely, and inevitable brings dangers in its train. But if he <br/>recognizes the situation and can comprehend the danger, he knows how to <br/>protect himself and remains unharmed.<br/><br/><br/>54:\tNine in the fourth place means:<br/>\tThe marrying maiden draws out the allotted time.<br/>\tA late marriage comes in due course.<br/><br/>The girl is virtuous. She does not wish to throw herself away, and allows the <br/>customary time for marriage to slip by. However, there is no harm in this; <br/>she is rewarded for her purity and, even though belatedly, finds the husband <br/>intended for her.\t<br/></i><br/><br/>...which come to think of it isn't such a bad description of our two pilgrims!<br/><br/>As to your other question, I do in fact worry that too much contact with the Big N reduces the menace. My plan, such as it is, is to have his appearances (which should be much shorter and infrequent going forward) be more and more frightening, if possible. There was a bit of a progression in this session--he was helpful to Pearkes, indifferent to Freddie, and of course threw Charleston off the top of a building. (I let CP do his narrative there, although it was a close thing--I could have forced the issue a bit.) Screwing with N is a losing proposition, although just rolling over for him probably isn't a great idea either. Charleston probably has the best strategy in keeping N intrigued with him. He's fickle, however, and ultimately you run the danger that you'll just piss him off to the point of doing something horrible. <br/><br/>I'm obviously not running a traditionalist game but sooner or later really terrible things are likely to happen. (I haven't forgotten that Charleston made a deal with a certain Titular Titan. That's going to start coming due.) Noor is in the line of fire, as is Sheila, and we still haven't even touched just exactly what Mwimbe's place in all this is. The pot is being stirred; the simmering has begun; soon we'll have some nice terror gumbo.<br/><br/>Or something. I hope at least as frightening as that metaphor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420384/#Comment_420384" name="Item_221" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-19T20:17:20+00:00" title="August 19, 2013  8:17PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: The Windmills of Your Mind (Part 19)</b><br/><br/><i>Wednesday, 22 April 1925</i><br/><br/>Freddie and company begin to make plans to return to the Continent.

I leaned on the scale a bit, although I did make it clear that bankrupting Freddie wouldn't hurt his Credit Rating (that's not what it measures, really) and flat out told them they could go to Africa or Shanghai.

Freddie has no trouble meeting the Consul.<br/><br/>"I seem to be in need of new citizenship," says Freddie once he has settled in to the Consul's dusty office, "and I thought I might see what opportunities could be found in the German Republic."<br/><br/>"Are you German?"<br/><br/>"On the contrary. I am soon to be ex-British. However, I'm probably of German descent, must be a Saxe-Coburg lurking around somewhere in the family tree."<br/><br/>"German citizenship is by blood, not birth, so it is possible I could help you. I will have to gather some information. It will take some time--our resources are rather limited. Very limited. My resources, that is."<br/><br/>"I see. Perhaps this could help." Freddie writes out a large check. "Let me give you some references. There was Heinrich...and Fritz...and someone from Stuttgart..."<br/><br/>The Consul agrees to check up on things and get back to Freddie in a few days. Having started the ball rolling, Freddie heads to the British Embassy to keep his appointment.<br/><br/>He is met by the two agents. One slips the other a fiver when Freddie appears in the office. They take him in to meet the Ambassador.<br/><br/>"Stilton old man?"<br/><br/>"Oh, hullo Freddie." The rather malarial Englishman knocks a bottle off his desk as Freddie comes in. "What're doing to cause Baldwin to get all shirty with me? I'm supposed to arrest you and hold you for deportation. Had to look that word up."<br/><br/><i>[Credit Rating spend by Freddie to make yet another NPC a school chum of his.

Seems to save you the bother."<br/><br/>"I dunno, I was never good at law."<br/><br/>"You wanted to study butterflies, as I recall."<br/><br/>"Pater said it waste of time. And this is a very important position, he told me. I am the Consul-General to Aden!"<br/><br/>"And how many butterfly species are there around here?"<br/><br/>"Not a blessed one, old man, not a blessed one. I couldn't get the Ambassadorship to Mexico. Monarchs, you know. You want a drink? I'm having a drink. So blessed hot."<br/><br/>"I'm pretty sure drinking makes that worse."<br/><br/>"Yes, but then I forget I'm in blessed Aden!"<br/><br/>"Listen old man, do you think you could hold off on that deportation, until I'm out of your hair?"<br/><br/>"Wait, I know what that is called. I could release you on your own recognition!"<br/><br/>"Recognizance, old boy."<br/><br/>"Right."<br/><br/>"Seems a bit of a shame you're still in Aden. Perhaps I could get you reassigned, to--British Honduras? Or the Seychelles?"<br/><br/>"Fantastic." They clink glasses.<br/><br/><i>Sunday, 26 April 1925</i><br/><br/>The German Consul summons Freddie down to his office. "I have checked those references you gave us," he says. "Jens says he remembers you from that time in Stuttgart."<br/><br/>"Ah, it was Stuttgart."<br/><br/>"Yes. He says they have put your picture up in the bar you destroyed."<br/><br/>"I didn't destroy the whole thing, just set fire to that one bar."<br/><br/>"Yes. Alfred says you still owe him 500 Reichsmarks."<br/><br/>"Well, that's not worth a lot anyway."<br/><br/>"Pre-war Reichsmarks. He said to make a point of that. Berthold sends his disgust. Not sure what that means. <br/><br/>"I asked all of them about your character. They said you had none."<br/><br/>"That's a good point."<br/><br/>"Normally, based on such a report, your application would be denied. However, they all agreed that you are fabulously wealthy.

I'd balk at PP having his character be always triumphant in all ways -- but I would be fine with the character saving the world via horrid means, being a total hero in his mind -- and, really, in fact, as little is more horrid than the OGs taking over, kinda by definition -- but considered a psychopathic traitor who either lived the rest of his life on the run or who died an unsung martyr, committing brutalities to save the world for the ignorant-but-ethically-purer.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420418/#Comment_420418" name="Item_223" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T10:19:25+00:00" title="August 20, 2013 10:19AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa,<br/><br/>I really wasn't sure. Had GP shown up, I would have brought him in as an outside force going in to help rescue the other PCs, but that didn't happen. I was interested (as N says) in finding out from FP just what Freddie would do for somebody not himself, but FP shortcut that and I gave him his head. Mostly. (I got a bit shirty because it was blatantly meta rules monkeying instead of doing stuff related to the fiction, but some of that is on me for not establishing the rules in the fiction better.)<br/><br/>I've emphasized at numerous points that they should expect Bad Things, and we're finally at the point of the campaign where those will begin to happen. Not sure to what degree folks are <i>really</i> ready for it; I would suggest--and I don't mean this really as a criticism--that there's still a "D&amp;D" mentality working here. Which is fine and all and I do have to respect my audience, but at some point they won't be able to win all the time. Reading Vincent's stuff over my vacation helped; I'm going to see how far I can get pushing stuff in the fiction, looking at stuff through crosshairs, and using some adapted moves from Dungeon World.<br/><br/>FWIW, I think you've pegged FP pretty well--he'd probably sacrifice Freddie for the right reasons, and I doubt he'd drag the aunts in. I do think he's hoping that his Wooster-style plot immunity will carry him through (and it might; the only thing is that Bertie gets immunity because he's fundamentally clueless, and has a very smart guy helping him. Freddie doesn't have those advantages.) As for Pearkes, well, that was just a CF all around. I did a crap job giving him the challenges he wanted, and PP did a crap job of trying to integrate his wants with those of the party. Or maybe it was as simple as I couldn't take the portrayal of an un-nuanced racist bully and didn't do the right thing and talk to him about it. It for sure pushed my buttons.<br/><br/>In any case, PP will be at most an intermittent presence going forward (assuming his move is permanent--these things can change) and we'll be bringing in some new blood this weekend. I'm already working on a Gatsby-esque Fiasco playset for it :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420425/#Comment_420425" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T11:45:42+00:00" title="August 20, 2013 11:45AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sympathy -- it's hard when you tailor the plot to the group, and then you don't get the full group.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with FP establishing that Freddie would die for Jax. That's totally awesome and tells you something about him that you want to abuse the hell out of.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>So, back when I was running my first Cthulhupunk campaign (no relation to SJG's GURPS Cthulhupunk), a friend was helping me come up with a masterplan or three -- one for Nyarlathotep, one for Nodens, and one for the true author of the Necronomicon, willing to destroy 90% of the population to save the world, and willing to destroy 100% to deny Nyarly and Co. victory. And he was running his plan by a friend of his, concerned about some holes in it.<br/><br/>His friend said something along the lines of, "This will work. What you have to remember is that this idea of POW? And POW points? That's a game mechanic. It's not the fiction. It's not the world. Characters in the world aren't going to think "Everyone can spare at least 2 points of POW, probably more, so we can power the mcguffin without killing anyone." That's not how it works. It works by eating Life Energy -- by eating a life or a soul. The PCs can't metagame this, and you don't need to let the players do it either."<br/><br/>Similarly, FP may be thinking "Okay, I can have Freddie go down to -13 Health", but that is utterly meaningless in the game world. The important thing is that Freddie's trying to die. Freddie also doesn't know that he's FP's character. So, you need to establish a few things with FP -- Freddie, being a character, not a person, doesn't get a vote.<br/><br/>1. The mechanic you described is descriptive. It is not proscriptive. If you don't want to bump off the character, it's totally fine to say, "No, Freddie can't metagame and do precisely X points of damage to himself. Basically, his goal is to die, right? Unfortunately for Freddie, these people are good at stopping that sort of thing, particularly given his situation."<br/><br/>2. If you are okay with FP offing Freddie, break the fourth wall. Say to FP, in plain English, "Okay, whatever Freddie may think, I am telling you as the GM that this is not a dream. If Freddie dies here, he is permanently dead, no resurrection, no nothing. Is this what you want? If not, tell me what you want to achieve here (you, not Freddie, eve if there is some bleed), and we'll figure out what happens."<br/><br/>3. The game is going somewhere icky, which happens in some CoC / ToC / Cthulhu Dark games. Some players don't want to deal and either don't want to be seen as wussing out or are crap at communicating "I want out -- this is beyond my comfort level." They need a way to say, "Stop -- get me out of here". Whether that's the X-card, whether that's a discussion before the game about what they don't want, whether that's you saying in the "this is how it works" spiel "And if at any point, we are going somewhere you don't want to go, tell me, because I cannot read you mind and will not know if you don't tell me", they need a way to signal "Stop. I am not cool with this."<br/><br/>If that happens, it doesn't matter whether it's "I'm squicked by the description" or "I don't want my character to be in this kind of situation" or "I don't want to be forced to have my character do X". You stop. If it's "I'm okay with the what, but I need a fade to black here," cut the scene and work out the end results -- or work out that you're not going to specify details. If it's "I don't want my character forces into this situation", stop, find a quick resolution, move on, and, after the session, find time to sit down with the player and say, "Okay, here are my expectations about what will happen in the game and how things will get bad." I'm not talking spoilers, you understand, but I am talking genre expectations.<br/><br/>4. Okay, so the immediate situation has been dealt with. Good or bad, I'm assuming it's at least Good Enough to keep on playing. But, you're concerned, and I think rightly so, that when you move into Bad Things Happening, one or more players will be unhappy. I don't care whether this is because of a D&amp;D mentality or genre expectations. The point is, you want X, and one or more of the players may want Not X. Talk about this now.<br/><br/>If one or more players is firm about Not X, you've got choices. You can go really pulpy and break your world. If some players are good with X, you can let those who aren't live a semi-charmed NotX life. You can decide that the campaign won't work and stop, which is a sad option, but a better one than trying to force X on players who want Not X. But, you need to know where you stand. Does a player want his PC's beloved NPCs to have script immunity? Does he insist on always coming out on top? Is he fine with a dramatic death? Some things you can compromise on -- I had one player determined to save an NPC's dog. She was fine with the NPC dying. Okay, I could work with that. The dog was saved. I had another player with multiple PCs, one of whom had supertech devices and lived in a homebuilt fortress. That one, I told the player, was essentially a patron / NPC, just one played by someone who was't the GM. I couldn't plot for that character in the world I was running.<br/><br/>Sorry if I'm babbling; I am fighting off a head cold. (At least, I hope I'm fighting it off.) It's just that the growing darkness is something that's only going to become a bigger issue as the game goes on, and making that fun to play can be a challenge outside of a convention one-shot.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420430/#Comment_420430" name="Item_225" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T12:39:36+00:00" title="August 20, 2013 12:39PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa,<br/><br/>Yeah, absolutely. As I said in the write-up, when FP pulled that I should have stepped back and pointedly a) asked him how that worked in the fiction and b) flat-out told him that whatever he was in, the effects were real and dead would be dead. Again, Vincent handles this really well in AW and its descendants; but I hadn't read AW yet, just had a "I've followed some discussions" understanding of it. Actually reading it was a really profound experience in understanding how to structure things.<br/><br/>Yanno, though, he wasn't dying to save Jax. He was dying to get out of the situation entirely. Like I said back then, I'm not sure if it was a line-crosser, or just wanting to "win." (Either is valid, though for different reasons.) Whether Freddie would die for Jax...that's an excellent question. Oddly enough, something like this came up between us in another game, one PP GMed. It was the Pathfinder Adventure Path "Carrion Crown." PP, who as you can imagine, likes combat-heavy encounters, turned everything up to 11 at the end, throwing dragons and hordes of undead at us. Of course, I had a bow-focused Paladin as my PC, and in case you don't know Pathfinder, they're basically insta-killers for...undead and evil dragons.<br/><br/>Anyway, my PC died during the encounter. Before the Final Boss fight. So I was pondering what to do. I kinda felt that his arc <i>should</i> end with him dying; I'd switched PCs during the campaign, and justified it retroactively by having him want to avoid dying to rid the world of evil, and instead settle down with his husband. Blah blah blah call to adventure, and I brought him back for the finale.<br/><br/>I finally decided to use a Hero Point to avoid death. Came back, finished off the last Bosses, and then when I was done, said (IC) that it was time for me to move on--the idea being that he had been given a reprieve to finish his mission but after that he'd have to let death be permanent. Now, I liked that, but FP, oddly enough, had trouble accepting it. It was kinda funny, really; I kept insisting that no, Jack died, he was moving on to the next phase, and FP kept saying, your god probably would send you back the next day.<br/><br/>Take of that what you will.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm going to have a GM...I originally typed "lecture" but that's not right. Rap session? Something where I talk about what I'm thinking of WRT the game (no NPC is safe, inevitable betrayal, the bad guys having significantly more resources, murderhobo lifestyle impossible in the developed world) and also talk about what to do about Going Places folks are uncomfortable with. I'll probably introduce some kind of X card (right now, I'm thinking maybe a red-suit playing card for each player) to help avoid issues. Now's the time, with two new players coming into the group.<br/><br/>I should probably ask for advice about how to structure that talk, so I'm asking for advice about how to structure that! The X card bit I can grab from the web, and the rest will probably boil down to...make sure the plausibility test comes from the fiction, or fictional models, not the game mechanics, Does that make sense? Like, if this is something that Bourne or Buffy &amp; Xander or god help us Quartermain might do/not do, that's where we lead, and justify that with the mechanics. The other way around won't work. I already plan to insist that things get done in the fiction, and no "I spend X Reassurance" and that's it. I mean, I'm all for letting the mechanics handle things, but I need to know what's happening in the fiction. You don't want to roleplay it? S'fine, tell me what you want to have happen and I'll give it some consequences and away we go.<br/><br/>But it's gotta be something. It can't be just a spend with nothing explained.<br/><br/>Structurally, I'm planning to do a couple of things like take regular breaks and shut down earlier rather than later. I have board games for when we're done, if folks want to hang out! I think a lot of times I get in trouble when I don't pull back, and taking breaks will probably help keep me focused. And, you know, taking a step back.<br/><br/>It's really going to come down to "focus on outcome, not on process." Or, tell me what you want, and then let's figure out how that does or doesn't happen. I'm tired of the many-stepped goat thing I mentioned a while ago--that is, putting little details step by step into the fiction, leading us to ludicrous places.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420439/#Comment_420439" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T14:03:00+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  2:03PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, that makes sense. Have you read Sorcerer? It's the game that first introduced me to the idea of conflict resolution vs combat resolution. You're playing a ladies' man? And you flub a roll? Okay, this shouldn't mean the character forgets to be suave, but it does mean something goes wrong, so what's the goal? Or, as I later learned, the X-Y problem. (I forget if I've defined that here.)<br/><br/>What we used to do was break for dinner, which was a nice way to ground and chat out of character. This works if one starts gaming around noon on a weekend (for values of noon which might be 2pm) and breaks for dinner around 6-8pm. Another useful trick is the bathroom break. One of my first gms used that whenever he wasn't sure what to do next.<br/><br/>But definitely, with two people coming in, you've got an opportunity to recalibrate and talk with folks. I'm not sure how one does this particular kind of talk, apart from the X-card. I guess one can say, "In games like D&amp;D and Pathfinder, there's usually a way out, but this isn't the case for Call / Trail of Cthulhu"? What kind of experience do the new gamers have?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420459/#Comment_420459" name="Item_227" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T19:46:05+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  7:46PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've sorta broken for dinner but often played through.

I've definitely used "fail forward" and other ideas to get away from making everything binary. I was playing Fiasco tonight and was trying to make a point of getting every scene to have some kind of stakes in it--which is good practice for running this game.<br/><br/>I think you're dead on that I have to do even more than what I planned, and make explicit the idea that sometimes things are going to go badly and there won't be a way to avoid it--just mitigate it, at best. Just need to phrase it without being heavy handed.<br/><br/>The new players? One is pretty experienced; I anticipate him playing a hitter, although he could surprise me.

Freddie spends that leg of the trip trying to revive his college German by speaking to the several Germans riding on the train with them.<br/><br/>Along the way, Freddie discovers that Mwimbe still has the Dagger of Thoth, which he fears had been lost in whatever mystical universe he had been thrown by Nyarlathotep. "Of course, Mr. Blakely," Mwimbe assures him. "I keep all of our most powerful artifacts."<br/><br/>"Good show. By the way, if you meet Thoth, stick him with that. He's a bit of a prig."<br/><br/>"Trust me, I am acquainted with the nature of the Dark Lord."<br/><br/>Pearkes has shed his uniform in favor of a three-piece suit. The utter cronyism of Parliament's attempt to strip Freddie's citizenship has left him disoriented. "We're supposed to stand for principles," he complains.<br/><br/><i>[I'll say this for PP: it's pretty perfect that George only noticed the downside of Empire when it hurt one of his friends.]</i><br/><br/>"Ah yes, Colonel Pearkes," says Mwimbe. "Your Empire stands for many principals. Imperialism. Colonialism. White supremacy. So many fine principles indeed. You bring your government where it is not wanted, that too is a principle."<br/><br/>"By the way, Mwimbe," says Freddie, "what nation are you a citizen of, anyway? We'll need to know when we cross the border."<br/><br/>"I am a subject of the British Empire."<br/><br/>"Then why are you so down on it," says Pearkes in a low voice.<br/><br/>"Because that is an honor I have always tried to decline."<br/><br/><br/>Eventually they reach the French border. There are orders to stop Freddie, but between his German passport and a few bushels of francs spread liberally around, they are able to make their way to Paris. As soon as they get settled, Freddie calls his aunts.<br/><br/>"Roland, what disgrace have you brought on this family?"<br/><br/>"Hullo Agatha."<br/><br/>"I can't even go out anymore. A private bill?"<br/><br/>"What's Baldwin got to do with this?"<br/><br/>"I don't know, but he's letting it go through. Lady Spencer's boy, Winston, is trying to stop it."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Paris! the City of Lights! According to her journal, Jackson stayed here for over a month, speaking with Edouard Gavigan, the head of the charitable Penhew Foundation, claimed to have been pursued by a cult, and was ultimately rescued by one of her contacts, Mickey "Scoop" Mahoney, publisher of an Irish Nationalist paper. <br/><br/>They decide to look up Mickey up near Place R\xe9publique. The office is nothing particularly impressive. Various shabby looking writerly types are sitting in it, smoking. The young male secretary looks up as they enter.<br/><br/>"Can I help you?"<br/><br/>"We're here to see Mr. Mahoney."<br/><br/>"D'ye have an appointment?"<br/><br/>"Not in the slightest, but we're here about a young woman named Jackson Elias."<br/><br/>"Ah, Miss Jax? I remember her. Just a minute."<br/><br/>Not long after the door to Mahoney's office opens. A stooped man wearing very thick glasses shambles out, followed by a stout, ebullient Irishman in his fifties. "Listen, Jimmy, 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation'--it's not what we're lookin' for this week. Try again in a bit. Oh, and Sylvia down by Shakespeare's says she has a check fer you."<br/><br/>"What ho, Mahoney?"<br/><br/>"Ah, you're the one about Jackson. Who's this?"<br/><br/>"He's my driver. He's also a reporter."<br/><br/>"There's no way in hell he's a journalist. Come on in."<br/><br/>Charleston feels the same way about Mahoney--there's no way he's a newspaperman. He has the look of a killer.<br/><br/>"Now, gentlemen, I knew Miss Jackson very well. I was fond of the old girl. So I'm asking you very calmly and carefully, why are you following up on her?"<br/><br/>"Sort of following in her footsteps, I think."<br/><br/>"Everyone here was very sad to hear about her passing. And if someone was trying to prevent her from stopping the thing she wanted to stop, we'd take none too kindly to it."<br/><br/>"Not at all. We're trying to stop that...person from taking over the world."<br/><br/>"I don't know anything about that. She was following some leads. Put her on the trail of Edouard Gavigan, big muckety muck."<br/><br/>"You know, we met Hypatia Masters."<br/><br/>"That's not possible, is it? Seeing as she's as dead as Jackson."<br/><br/>"She claimed to be very old, and was certainly insane."<br/><br/>"Hrm. Well, if you're following up on her, you'd best start with Gavigan. Very well to do Frenchman. You're about up to his class, I guess. And if you want, I can look into this Gavigan a bit, see if I can shake anything out about him."<br/><br/>With his money running lower than usual, they are forced to take quarters in a mere four-star hotel. Freddie's man of business contacts him with news that he's liquidated some more assets. "Don't worry old boy, I'm putting it in the American stock market! Safe as houses! We'll make a mint!"<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420760/#Comment_420760" name="Item_238" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T10:36:56+00:00" title="August 27, 2013 10:36AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the Joyce reference, as I'm a Joycean.<br/><br/>So, what are the fronts you've got?

I must remedy that at some point, especially since I found Joe's quick-n-dirty guide to hacking AW so useful.<br/><br/>I'd post the fronts up here except they're, you know, active and all :-) and there are some surprises for my players built in.<br/><br/>However:<br/><br/>The front I used in the most recent session was called The Paris Brotherhood. I put four dangers under it; three aren't particularly spoiler-ific, thus:<br/><br/>Edouard Gavigan (ambitious cult-leader)<br/><br/>Tewfik al-Sayed (also ambitious cult-leader, with some moves borrowed from the Arcane Enemy section of Dungeon World)<br/><br/>Hypatia Masters (mystical being, e.g. Arcane Enemy)<br/><br/>I did a countdown clock for each, rather than Grim Portents. I think that may have been a mistake, or I don't really know how to do a good countdown clock--the examples Vincent gives basically have no difference between start and 9:00. Now, that's okay--you can have dread-building stuff going on--but I think I'd be better served by just doing the Grim Portents without a clock.<br/><br/>We did a couple of things this most recent session that I liked. One was using the Marvel Initiative (name who goes next, basically). I'm thinking of actually adapting something like that for the regular gameplay. I've already decided that I want to step up the pacing by making the basic unit of time "about a week" rather than "about a day"; time's kinda crawling, and the PCs are on a clock (though they don't know that) so I'd like to make the time pressure a bit more...pressing. I'm thinking of doing something like including a "GM turn mechanic" as a good way to better simulate horror. That is, I'll let the players go around the table, but then I'll also get my own "turn" to do...whatever. One of my moves. This will tend to make the PCs a bit more desperate, which I like.<br/><br/>I also think that what I really want is noir, not pulp, as the dominant genre of the campaign; it's a better fit for my vision. I need to talk to the players about that.<br/><br/>All in all, the most recent session went pretty well, and I liked what the new players brought to the table. And I'll write it up, soon! I have about one more chapter in Episode VI; it's the whole interview with Gavigan debacle, which I'm a bit embarrassed to have to do again--it wasn't a shining moment for anybody concerned, I think.<br/><br/>The Fiasco playset in Episode VII was kind of fun, I'll provide details when the write up begins. I made a pretty professional layout for it, which I will also make available.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420800/#Comment_420800" name="Item_240" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T21:56:10+00:00" title="August 27, 2013  9:56PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you've not read Monsterhearts, I'm thinking maybe you should wait until after the campaign.

The colors are muted, the tone is more desperate -- but there's often a sense that there are rare good people who will make the sacrifices necessary to keep an admittedly corrupt world safe for a few more years. Masks, as written, feels more Pulp, but it can totally be run Noir. It's just that, as you said, you'll need to talk to the players about that.<br/><br/>I really need to reread Apocalypse World. I'm drawing a blank on how one does Fronts and forgot it had a countdown clock -- I remember that from Monster of the Week (which, IF you want yet another game jumping up and down inside your head begging you to use its cool stuff, is a better fit for what you're doing than Monsterhearts is).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420806/#Comment_420806" name="Item_241" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T01:15:59+00:00" title="August 28, 2013  1:15AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeon possibly has a better explanation of Fronts than AW. tremulus is not as helpful as I'd hoped it would be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420810/#Comment_420810" name="Item_242" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T06:36:35+00:00" title="August 28, 2013  6:36AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, I think you're on the money there, or rather: DW shows you how you can use fronts for a lot of things, including campaigns, while AW (as is the case with everything in the book except for the general stuff about the Consequences Engine) is precisely tailored for the kind of world Vincent was making. Which is great, really--I mean, it's brilliant writing--but if you're shamelessly stealing stuff, it requires more work :-)<br/><br/>Lisa, I think I'm going to have to snatch up Monster of the Week--that thing looks bloody awesome, and could just be the "one-shot * World game" I've been looking for; I'm the spillover GM at our Tuesday meetup, and I've wanted to run a * World game but have been kinda down on the idea of a perpetual series of First Sessions.<br/><br/>It's looking like there's a possibility that we'll get sessions in on the 7th and 21st, yay! Though more work!<br/><br/>I'm finding a tension between trying to do a fully reactive * World type setup and the needs for an investigative game to have staged scenes. What I'm thinking of doing is prepping a few scenes with Investigative clues in them, key them to the fronts, and let that stuff happen or not. This is basically how Masks is written, after all, and close to the recommended structure for a Gumshoe game. (To be honest, I find the spine + scenes structure of Gumshoe to be a bit potentially railroady; I prefer a more robust decision tree, like what Justin Alexander does.)<br/><br/>Noir versus pulp is an interesting distinction; Noir is definitely a subset of pulp, but there's some key distinctions. I'm going to have to think about what those are.

Arriving, the group discovers that it is frequented mainly by Egyptians. The decor is very tacky faux-Egyptian. Charleston tries to bring Noor in to translate what the clientele and waitstaff say in Arabic, but after a few shouted words between her and the maitre d', she refuses to go in.<br/><br/>"They called me a [gender slur] who sleeps with a bunch of [racial slurs]!" she huffs. "And then they told me to go and do a sexual act with the pigs who brought me."<br/><br/>Off to their typical warm welcome, Freddie and company enter.<br/><br/>"Messieurs, bienvenue a votre club, je suis raivissant--oh, you're English. What can I do for you?" the owner, a stout man named Abdul Nawisha, says as they sit down. "We have the finest entertainment--belly dancers, all genuine Bedouin straight from the desert."<br/><br/>Pearkes notices that Nawisha had come over from a table where an elegantly-dressed French businessman was sitting with many papers, asking Nawisha to sign them. Over at the bar, a couple of policemen are talking in rapid French to the bartender.<br/><br/>"I don't speak French," replies the bartender, in Arabic. Even though Freddie doesn't understand Arabic anymore, he can tell that the bartender is just trying to blow them off.<br/><br/>"Orange juice, please!" orders Freddie. "And a whisky! What ho, fine members of the constabulary!"<br/><br/>"You are English?"<br/><br/>"You'd think that, but I am actually German!"<br/><br/>"As a gentleman," says one of the policemen, "I think you should go to much better clubs. I can think of three. The Green Monkey--"<br/><br/>"That place is terrible," interrupts his partner. "Now, the Graceful Rabbit--"<br/><br/>"Overrated!" They argue for a while, while Freddie takes notes.<br/><br/>"In any case," says the first cop, "There are criminals here. We are investigating a murder, which is not all that interesting, really. We have found three girls, now, floating in the Seine. All of them were dancers here. Word in the quarter is that there are two other women who have been murdered who have some relation to this place."<br/><br/>While Freddie is talking to the cops, Charleston, who always watches the door, sees a well-dressed Egyptian man in a fez walk in. Nawisha fawns over him as he guides him to a private table. As soon as he is seated, the show begins, a fact Charleston notes with interest.<br/><br/>"Check out the guy in the fez," he says to Freddie, who promptly heads over to speak with the newcomer.<br/><br/>Nawisha intercepts him. "You do not need to be speaking with him."<br/><br/>"Just wanted to buy him a drink."<br/><br/>"He does not need anyone to buy him a drink."<br/><br/>Freddie brushes past and sits down at the man's table.<br/><br/>"Who are you," hisses the man. "Why are you disturbing my peace?"<br/><br/>"I thought of all the men in this bar, you had the highest qualities, and I was wondering if I could have a word with you."<br/><br/>"Why have you brought a British soldier to this place?"<br/><br/>"He's Canadian."<br/><br/>"That does not impress me."<br/><br/>"My name is Blakely."<br/><br/>"I am Tawfik al-Sayed," says the man slowly, as if he's trying to place Freddie.<br/><br/>"I was hoping to have a moment of your time outside this bar?"<br/><br/>"What could possibly induce me to do that?"<br/><br/>"I happen to server certain British interests, and was thinking that the opportunities--"<br/><br/>"I am a spice merchant. I have suppliers around the world. I am an ambitious man but I have no need of such opportunities. And in any case I have a man of business for such matters." He gives Freddie a card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Charleston goes out in search of Noor. Most people don't want to talk to him, but eventually he tracks her down to the Mosque of Paris. Soon Freddie and Pearkes join him, waiting outside of it.<br/><br/>"Have you been murdered?" asks Charleston when she finally comes out.<br/><br/>"I think I would have remembered that."<br/><br/>The walk through the streets of the Latin Quarter. "Several Egyptian girls have been murdered," says Charleston.<br/><br/>"But I am not Egyptian! I am perfectly safe."<br/><br/>"Don't look now," says Pearkes quietly, "but we're being followed."<br/><br/>A small figure is keeping pace with them, sticking to the shadows. Charleston doubles back around and starts to follow their pursuer. He easily slips up to her--as he realizes that this is one of the belly dancers from the club. He tugs on her pony tail.<br/><br/>"Don't hurt me! Please don't hurt me!"<br/><br/>"Relax!"<br/><br/>"Oh God! Don't--"<br/><br/>"What? No, nothing like that." Pearkes and Freddie rush up.<br/><br/>"Messieurs," says the girl, "my name is Yalesha. You don't know what goes on at that club."<br/><br/>"I think I have an idea," says Charleston. "Girls get murdered."<br/><br/>"You do not! Girls are murdered--or they vanish. Ten in the year since I started working there. Al-Sayed likes me, and that has saved me so far, but I think soon he will stop liking me, and then I will vanish too!"<br/><br/>"Are you pimped out?" asks Freddie. Yalesha slaps him.<br/><br/>"I just want to know if there's a way to get you out of there," he mutters, rubbing his jaw.<br/><br/>"It doesn't work like that," says Yalesha. "We are kept in an apartment building, always under guard. I was able to slip away just for a moment. I must go back soon. But I am very scared. The time of the moon is coming, and that is when the girls vanish!"<br/><br/>Before she scampers away, Pearkes gives her a hundred francs in small denominations so it looks like she was working. They head back to the hotel, where they find a note saying that Edouard Gavigan would be happy to meet them the next day.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420849/#Comment_420849" name="Item_244" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T20:14:52+00:00" title="August 28, 2013  8:14PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: The Windmills of Your Mind (Part 22)</b><br/><br/><br/><i>Wednesday, 6 May 1925</i><br/><br/>They drop by Mickey Mahoney the next morning. "What can I do ye fer?"<br/><br/>"Two questions," says Freddie. "What do you know of this Gavigan?"<br/><br/>"Supposed to be from a good family out in the provinces, went to the Ecole Diplomatique. I could look into him for you, won't know for a day or so."<br/><br/>"Second, do you know this Tawfik al-Sayed?"<br/><br/>"Just an Arab merchant. Could have an operative, er, reporter look into him."<br/><br/>"Do you know anything about these murders in the Quarter?"<br/><br/>"Aye, some say there's more and they're being covered up."<br/><br/>"Charleston says that there are at least ten."<br/><br/>"That would make a good headline! We'll have to chase down the leads."<br/><br/>"Two policemen, Jacques and Andre, that I spoke with last night, might have something to say to you."<br/><br/><br/>Fondation Aubrey Penhew is located on the Rive Droite, near the Rue Richlieu and the National Library--a pretty high-powered address. A pleasant young secretary addresses them in lyrical French, and introduces them to Baldur von Hasselbach, a doctoral student.<br/><br/><i>[von Hasselbach was a character in a one-shot, Cthulhuesque Risus game I ran a few years ago. PP would have been the only one who remembered him, and he didn't. So much for shout outs.]</i><br/><br/>"I'm a countryman," says Freddie. "A proud citizen of the Republic of Germany."<br/><br/>"Ah, well. Republics come and go. As I am sure no Frenchman would need to be reminded."<br/><br/>"Don't you guys have tons of Reichs?" asks Charleston.<br/><br/>"Yes. Two so far. Shall we begin the tour?"<br/><br/>He takes him upstairs, around the extremely well-appointed library which is devoted to archaeology, specifically Egyptian archaeology. Baldur switches effortlessly between French, German, English and Russian as he introduces the various visiting scholars.<br/><br/>Gavigan's office is lavishly furnished in Second Empire style. The man himself is a distinguished person in an impeccable suit, in his late forties, with gray hair at his temples. "Gentlemen, please, sit down."<br/><br/>Freddie does the introductions. "I am pleased to meet you all," says Gavigan, "although I am a bit...how you say? At sea? as to why you are here."<br/><br/>"Doing a favor for an old friend," says Freddie. "Erica Carlyle."<br/><br/>"Ah. I see. The Carlyle family has been a great friend of the Fondation, just as Sir Aubrey was a great friend of them. Erica is a patroness of our society. Of course, we lost poor Sir Aubrey."<br/><br/>"And Mr. Carlyle."<br/><br/>"Yes. And Mr. Carlyle. He was...not a gentleman by any means, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>Gavigan tells the same story as the group has already heard about the Expedition, with a notable addition. According to Gavigan, Roger was spending all his time with this mysterious woman M'Weru; in fact, it was Hypatia Masters who suggested they leave Egypt, to flee the developing scandal.<br/><br/>"Yes," says Freddie, "Hypatia told me something about that, but she was rather mysterious about the whole thing."<br/><br/>"You spoke with her before the expedition?"<br/><br/>"No, about three weeks ago."<br/><br/>"Mr. Blakely, why do give me the lie? Hypatia Masters is dead, Sir Aubrey is dead..."<br/><br/>"Let's just say that a woman who looked very much like the Miss Masters I remember spoke to me, and she was convinced she was Hypatia."<br/><br/>"I am not surprised. Just as there are Anastasias in all the capitals of Europe, some impostor must be posing as her. I have read the autopsy reports. I assure you they are dead. I am afraid you have been taken by a confidence artist, much like poor Roger. This M'Weru woman was one such; she absconded with the Expedition's funds. That is why Sir Aubrey and the rest were in the jungle, where they were slain by tribesmen."<br/><br/><i>[FP tries to Assess Honesty, but I tell him Gavigan is especially implacable.

"Erica also sent an American reporter to look into this. A woman names Jackson."<br/><br/>"Jackson Elias? I read about her death. But I do not think we met...but now that you mention it, yes, I did meet a young reporter. This may have been Elias. But I had nothing more to tell her than what I've told you."<br/><br/><i>[This was the tell.<br/><br/>And NOW we begin the sequence where FP tried to use Interrogation. Or Intimidation. Or something.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes notices that there seems to be another room adjoining the office, perhaps accessed through a concealed door in the closet. He gets up and locks the office door. <br/><br/>"I thought we would have a private conversation," he says. "Ask you some personal questions."<br/><br/>"I think this interview is over," says Gavigan. His hand slips under his desk, and Charleston notices that he seems to be pushing some kind of hidden button.<br/><br/>"I think it's just beginning," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>Charleston runs to the door and reverses a chair under it. Pearkes punches Gavigan.<br/><br/>"Pushing the button was an error," he says.<br/><br/>Banging comes from the door. "Aidez-moi!" shouts Gavigan. "Au secours!"<br/><br/>Pearkes unlimbers one of his Colts and points it at Gavigan's head. "You're going to shut your mouth and listen very carefully to what I have to say. You understand?"<br/><br/>Gavigan looks at him with a defiant glare.<br/><br/>"Tells us about Jackson Elias," shouts Pearkes.<br/><br/>"She's dead. She came here, and asked strange questions. She said Carlyle Expedition members were still alive. I told her she was insane. She looked insane. She acted insane. They are all dead!"<br/><br/>"Jack Brady is very much alive," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"I do not believe you about Hypatia, but Brady may be alive. I have tried to track him down. He is very hard to find. He is out in the Far East somewhere."<br/><br/>"Why do you have another room?" demands Charleston.<br/><br/>"It is a storage room, it is easier carry artifacts between rooms."<br/><br/>"Did you kill Hypatia? Is that how you are so sure she's dead?"<br/><br/>"I had nothing to do with any of them! I was Sir Aubrey's protege! I worked with him for many years! I mourned him <i>deeply</i> when he died!"<br/><br/>"We're going for a walk," says Pearkes, as he drags Gavigan into the next room. <br/><br/>"You are idiots," gasps Gavigan. "If you let me go now, I will not call the police."<br/><br/>"We could let you meet Hypatia," says Charleston, "then you won't call the police either."<br/><br/>"Or I could introduce you to my .45," says Pearkes.<br/><br/>"You are as crazy as Jackson," says Gavigan.<br/><br/>The "secret room" turns out to be a storeroom, filled with boxes and bookshelves. A large Egyptian sarcophagus is in the center. There is a door on the left wall; although it is closed, it seems to lead out into the main entrance.<br/><br/>"As you can see, gentlemen, this is a storage room. This is why I like to have a communication with it. I think we should all leave things where they are and you should go."<br/><br/>"I think that's a great idea!" says Freddie.<br/><br/><i>[Right here, now, this is where I should have been for sure doing a GM move. I should have been doing them all along--on the recording, I don't think I </i>once<i> said, What do you do? which means I wasn't setting up moves. Here, I should have "told them the consequences, and asked"--along the lines of, the police will be here very soon, do you leave now, or stay and risk arrest.<br/><br/>Had I been doing more of that, this would have been less nuts. Looking at it again, it wasn't so bad--as far as these things go--and I did several times give them a chance to get out of the situation. It was mostly PP continually digging the hole deeper.]</i><br/><br/>Pearkes picks up a small statuette. <br/><br/>"That is four thousand years old!" croaks Gavigan.<br/><br/>"Maybe you should listen, then?"<br/><br/>There is a pounding on the door to the entryway. "Police! Come out now!"<br/><br/>"Qu'est-ce que c'est la probl\xe8me?" asks Pearkes.<br/><br/>"I got a big problem, Mac!" shouts someone through the door. "You are holding one of my citizens! We want you to step out! Now!"<br/><br/>"Do me a favor," says Freddie. "Scuff up his knuckles, and punch me in the nose."<br/><br/>"With pleasure!" says Pearkes, and pops Freddie in the nose.<br/><br/>They open the door.<br/><br/>"You will please raise your hands."<br/><br/> "I would like to register a complaint against this man," says Freddie, gesturing with his head at Gavigan. "He struck me."<br/><br/>"We will make all decisions about who will receive complaints. All of you step out."<br/><br/>The police cuff Freddie, Charleston, and Pearkes. When they find Pearkes' brace of pistols, they cuff him behind his back, hard.<br/><br/><i>[CP wanted to fight at this point, which probably wouldn't have been a TPK, immediately. But it probably would have ended his involvement in the campaign--an Anglophone Chinese-American in Paris probably wouldn't be able to get far.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie swears out a complaint against Gavigan for hitting him when they get to the police station, but Gavigan swears out a complaint for kidnapping, criminal menace, assault, and attempted murder. Freddie gets tossed in a holding tank; Charleston locked up with the violent offenders; and Pearkes gets claimed by a man from the Embassy, backed up by some MPs.<br/><br/>Freddie manages to get sprung after a night, and a day or so later springs Charleston. He hires a lawyer.<br/><br/><i>[Here's where I got a bit annoyed; the PCs (led by FP) seemed confident that their story--Gavigan punched Freddie--would somehow protect them. I don't really think I was off-base by being skeptical about this. Gavigan was a highly influential member of a pretty corrupt ruling class, and had already pressed his "hey, guys are going to hit me" button on his desk. With no witnesses, I find it hard to believe that nay magistrate would countenance the PC's counter-charges; they were, after all, an annoying Englishman with an arrest record as thick as a phone book </i>in Paris alone<i>, not to mention his other cities of residence, a loose cannon British officer who had already been reprimanded by his own commanders, and a teenaged American with a criminal past. Given their utter lack of connections to French society, they were, to put it politely, f*cked.<br/><br/>Of course, they could have done stuff about this. FP consistently forgets that his "class ability" is to turn Credit Rating into contacts.<br/><br/>And most of all, I messed up by not following the Principles.

No updates! Sorry. Went away for a family reunion that turned out to be less fraught than I'd feared, and this week has been busy--I've decided that I should do prep, not writeups, this week.<br/><br/>Last post was the end to Episode VI. I have Episode VII in the can, just have to do the writeup. And Episode VIII is this weekend! Yikes!<br/><br/>I've been thinking more about pulling in * World influences. I thought they definitely helped last session--having my card with moves in front of me helped me a) see how many of them I do instinctively and b) when I got stuck, helped ground me.<br/><br/>I've also been gaining the conviction that the most important legacy of the * World games is to make "What do you do?" the standard ending of every GM utterance. Or as a larger principle, <i>the GM can never close an action.</i> Players close actions; GMs push the consequences. Just about every bad GMing situation I've either perpetuated or suffered under can be traced back to this. The whole Gavigan interrogation scene simply doesn't happen if I remembered this and used moves, specifically the most useful of all moves: Tell them the Consequences, and Ask. "You can try and do an interrogation here, but he's likely got ways to call for help, and his staff is just outside, so you're likely going to have to deal with the police. What do you do?"<br/><br/>Yeah. Hindsight etc.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of doing something that Vincent mentions in passing in the Custom Moves section of AW--he did a "roll + stat, and then pick some of the following" as a session introduction. I was thinking something like this:<br/><br/>Dear ALPHONSE,<br/><br/>For 1 XP, choose one; for 2 XP, choose two; for 4 XP, choose all three:<br/><br/>* Your cover is blown<br/>* Keeping your head down is stressful: -4 Stability<br/>* Anton is missing<br/><br/>...customized for each PC.<br/><br/>Was planning to do this as a reward system--Gumshoe simply has no parallel to the Fail/Partial/Success system in *World, being essentially a diceless system--but was also wondering if I could do it as a Stability roll ("Make a Stability Check with a TN of 5. If you succeed by 5+, choose 1; if you just succeed, choose 2; if you fail, all 3") since my original impetus was to bleed Stability from the PCs, but I'm not convinced that's a good idea, and giving rewards seems likelier to get buy-in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421147/#Comment_421147" name="Item_247" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T23:02:26+00:00" title="September  5, 2013 11:02PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Be careful here, as Gumshoe isn't *World. Not everything will translate as well as Fronts and Principles. I think you're onto something with "The GM can never close an action." The way Josh and framed it, when thinking about places where our games stalled, was "The person who asks the question should not be the one who answers it."<br/><br/>Also, there's sometimes too much emphasis on not saying "no" as a GM. Essentially, part of what you needed to say was "No, what you are trying to do will not work, because you are totally ignoring common sense and how reality works, even in a game." It's well and good -- and usually desirable -- to frame that as "Okay, if you do that, understand he's already summoned the police, the walls are not soundproof, and no one will believe your word over his. Expect to get arrested." I think this is "Tell them the consequences and let them choose."<br/><br/>And, that's a great principle. But, it is useful to remember that it also means, "No, you cannot have your PCs do whatever you want and have them succeed fully and walk away scott free."<br/><br/>And, do recognize that all of this discussion is far, far easier to do outside the session than when you're up to your armpits in alligators, er, players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421159/#Comment_421159" name="Item_248" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-06T06:56:59+00:00" title="September  6, 2013  6:56AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think "What do you do" is something special to AWE, it's a fundamental principle of roleplaying. GMs have been saying it from the start. AWE does bring it to the front and try to ensure that it's said more often (although if you listen to AWE actually plays, it's not as ubiquitous as Vincent might have it). An equivalent in GUMSHOE is to always have open leads. I always make sure that there is some mystery which affects the PCs which is left open. Usually I'll try to have two or three open leads. These are almost exactly the same thing as fronts.<br/><br/>Returning to the XP thing, this sounds similar to the way in which drives work, except the rewards (and costs usually) are stability. Just in our last session one player followed his character's drive, gained to stability, and then lost 6 as a result, as well as 2 Sanity. Obviously a defining moment for that character and which is going to have strong repercussions quite soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421168/#Comment_421168" name="Item_249" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-06T09:43:21+00:00" title="September  6, 2013  9:43AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa,<br/><br/>All good points. You are correct in your identification of the move. I think my original framing was slightly more open--not "expect to get arrested" but "expect that you will need to deal with his help, which includes the police." At the very least they would have asked more questions.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure I'll pull the trigger on my little consequence menu, although I don't think it's out of frame for Gumshoe. So the best thing to do is--democracy! Ask folks if they would like to try it out. So I guess that's what I'll do.<br/><br/>Steve, I'm definitely not saying that AW invented "what do you do" (and I'm pretty sure Vincent would agree with that!) But the emphasis on it--it's really drilled in the text, no matter if the actual is not as intense as the ideal--is really useful; I don't think many other game systems, even Fate (although the new edition seems to go this way as well) emphasize including that at the end of every GM statement. Too often, gaming examples show the GM doing what I call closing an action--player asks/attempts/wants something, GM responds, and then it ends. Of course, the player then makes a new question/attempt/need, and the cycle repeats.<br/><br/>It's more subtle to do stuff the * World way, where everything has a consequence, and that consequence keys into actions--less cycle, more flow. But I won't rehearse that here; I think most of us have a grasp of what the World engine does.<br/><br/>The point being, in the Gavigan scene, rather than do stuff like ask the players what they were doing, point out what could happen, etc., I just dropped a flat fact on them. You interrogate G in his office, you are now in jail. In AW terminology, I went straight to a hard move without setting up a soft move. You might argue that the PCs "handed me a situation on a golden platter" but it was still bad form.<br/><br/>(You might also argue that PP was doing the same thing by ignoring the other players, but that's more okay on his end than mine.)<br/><br/>A GM not having open-ended actions--in other words, dishing out consequences without asking for a player response--I think that's where the bad situations in most of the games I've been in have been created.<br/><br/>I'd like to get Drives in more often; probably the best way to do that is to carrot them more. I can probably do that with a pincers maneuver, i.e. do more to attack their Stability, which will drive them towards finding ways to refresh it via Drives.<br/><br/>To be honest, the thing I have the hardest time working in are the PIllars of Sanity. I mean, I understand them in principle but the rules are a bit hazy on what would trigger the shattering of a Pillar. So, if folks here have some advice on that I'd appreciate it. (It doesn't help that my players haven't chosen the world's most interesting PIllars.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421195/#Comment_421195" name="Item_250" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-07T01:01:33+00:00" title="September  7, 2013  1:01AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bit fuzzy headed (and gming tomorrow), but I'm wondering have you done the "Here is the sheet of things that call for a stability check"? That's where you hand players a copy of the sheet, and while you call for stability / sanity rolls as seems appropriate to you, often, the players will gleefully call for themselves to make the rolls. Hand a player agency to beat his PC up, and often, he's harder on the poor guy than the cruelest GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

          In our games players usually deal with all the stability loses themselves, it's a good way of involving them. It doesn't always work at Cons, if the players are further up the powergamer spectrum.<br/><br/>Regarding the hard move in Gavigan scene. There was a window for them to escape, having seen the button being pressed, and so they made a choice to stay. Soft move -&gt; Hard move. Seems fine to me. Are your players the kind whose characters rarely run away?<br/><br/>The rules for stability are a bit muddled in the main book but are better explained in the Keeper's Resource Book. This explains that if the narrative* causes the destruction of a pillar, the character looses 6 Stability and 2 Sanity. If a character has lost 3 Sanity, they can cause a pillar to "crumble from within", removing it without any further loss. Losing all pillars increases difficulty numbers by 1 (which is not so interesting).<br/><br/>*I usually take this to mean that the character expresses something counter to their pillar. So if they have Science Will Explain It All, and after passing through a gate, express the opinion that this breaks causality, and the second law of thermodynamics, it's probably safe to say that the pillar has gone. It's fine for the players to handle this themselves too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421300/#Comment_421300" name="Item_252" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T19:47:36+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  7:47PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay. A few things first! Steve, thanks for that. I'll have to ponder it. So far my group (with the exception of FP) seem generally resistant to the idea of Stability checks, especially for murderhobo activities, so I'm not sure how well that would work. So I think I'm absolutely going to have to try it! <br/><br/>As for Pillars, Charleston has had two crumble, but other than that I haven't been successful in attacking them. (I also need to update them on my master sheet--I don't think I actually have them for everybody.) Still, it's a pretty abstract thing to come to grips with: Freddie has "The Aunts must be obeyed" as a Pillar, and I'm not sure exactly what to do with that yet.<br/><br/>I ended up handing out my little AW-like consequence sheets, telling everyone they were completely optional, and everyone ended up going for them. So that worked. I don't think I'll do them every session, but they seem good for sessions where they've moved, or some time has elapsed either in the real world or in game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421307/#Comment_421307" name="Item_253" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-10T00:58:32+00:00" title="September 10, 2013 12:58AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Er... if they are resistant to Stability checks, why are they playing Trail of Cthulhu?

I have occasionally gotten pushback on asking folks for Stability checks for violent stuff. That's been less of an issue with PP reduced to possible infrequent guest player. CP grasped the magic system pretty well and seemed willing to trade stability for spells in the most recent session.<br/><br/>I think I'll print out the stability chart &amp; hand it out to folks, following GBSTeve's advice and see what happens. Even if they underbill their Stability, I can survive a session like that.<br/><br/>Folks have different expectations about Cthulhu games. BP clearly wanted something really purist, which I can't run. (I mean, seriously--The Big N as lounge singer?) Some folks like the 20s setting--I think that's FP's draw, as it lets him play Bertie Wooster. CP likes the group and likes his character. OP is probably traditionalist provided he gets a healthy dose of pulp to show off his hardboiled PI. JP...just likes RPing, and has fallen into the sunny, slightly inept sidekick. (I chose Elisha Cook, Jr. as Jimmy's character portrait.) GP is much the same, except with a laid-back, more competent sidekick character.<br/><br/>And I like the group! So I have to balance my own wants (dark angsty sacrifice-laden noir) with theirs (heroic mostly pulpy fights against alien Big Bads). So it ever goes; my Pathfinder game never really explored my feminist socialist utopia setting, as I felt I needed to give them some kind of Pathfinder-like experience.<br/><br/>I do have some...stuff planned for Gavigan's final response moves. (Spoiler alert--Tewfik dies rather surprisingly in Episode IX.) I've already given FP a hard choice in Episode IX, and I plan to have Gavigan demonstrate just what ruthless looks like in Episode X. So that will bring it back to darker stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421333/#Comment_421333" name="Item_255" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-10T11:25:35+00:00" title="September 10, 2013 11:25AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2013 11:28AM by Aviatrix.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: Mais la vie s\xe9pare ceux qui s'aiment (Prologue Part 1)</b><br/><br/><i>[So!

Everyone who was anyone went to them, or crashed them at the very least. Scott Fitzgerald dropped by and began to think about story ideas. Various gangsters filtered in and out, dropping off Canadian whiskey while grooving to jazz.<br/><br/>Upstairs in the mansion's master bedroom, Freddie Blakely, dissolute ex-pat Englishman, is rooting around for the owner's secret alcohol stash when he is surprised by Francis O'Donnell, a private eye, veteran of the great war, and tough guy.<br/><br/>"Donnie old boy! Is that you! Haven't seen you since Jordan's apartment that day!"<br/><br/>O'Donnell sighs. "Is that Glen?"<br/><br/>"Nothing so prosaic. This is a Kentuckey whiskey, I believe."<br/><br/>"Just pour."<br/><br/>"Sorry, I only seem to have teacups."<br/><br/>Freddie and Francis go downstairs, where Freddie catches sight of someone furtively trying to slip in among the crowds. "Why, Jimmy Wright!" shouts Freddie. "Are you here moonlighting as some kind of clandestine photographer?"<br/><br/>"No!  Just here for the party!" Jimmy says, desperately trying to get away from Freddie.<br/><br/>Francis catches sight of Jackson slipping in the crowd and drags her into a closet.<br/><br/>"Jesus, Francis! What the hell! What are you doing here--and in that suit? Didn't you get your war bonus?"<br/><br/>"Henry said you were in trouble."<br/><br/>"I'm always in trouble."<br/><br/>"I'm here to get you out of here."<br/><br/>"I just got here! Besides, I need to meet the guy throwing these parties. I'm supposed to be his secretary. It's a big story, and I don't have a book subject yet."<br/><br/>"This is more important."<br/><br/>"Look. If you're going to report on the Thuggee cult, you may have to do some things. It's a ritual murder cult! I <i>may</i> have been implicated. I took care of it!"<br/><br/>"All right. Listen.

She is reading from a little pink slip of paper. "I'm supposed to report to...oh. Freddie Blakely."<br/><br/>"Jackson Elias! Aren't you supposed to be killing Russians or something?"<br/><br/>"Russia was ages ago. I wrote a book; I'd say you should read it, but you don't read. Besides, did you ever <i>meet</i> John Reed? Guy had his head so far up his--well, anyway. I'm trying to report on the guy throwing these parties."<br/><br/>"Well, it's certainly not me."<br/><br/>"Riiight. How are you Freddie. I haven't seen you since Paris, after the war."<br/><br/>"Right. Just before I got thrown into prison for fomenting insurrection."<br/><br/>"Hey, I didn't say anything, I just wrote a story, got a hundred bucks from the UPI."<br/><br/><i>[We only did one scene each in the first act (believe it or not, that was the entire first act!)

I do know a lot of people at this party, and they would like to have their picture taken."<br/><br/>"Will they have their clothes on?"<br/><br/>"If you ask them to, I suppose they'll put them back on. Ah, my friends the vaudevillians! Julius old man!"<br/><br/>"Freddie. Howya doin'? This clown here says we should go into pictures. I told it would never work. We need sound."<br/><br/>"Especially for Arthur," says Leonard Marx, idling over by a piano. "Besides, once you do a bit in a film, you can never do it again! It would ruin our stage act."<br/><br/><i>[We had some discussion of where to go next--OP floated the idea of moving forward to after the party, but I argued for preserving the Aristotelian unities. I also suggested that I could bring in some campaign elements.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy spends some time taking pictures. Eventually she corners a young socialite and her lawyer friend.<br/><br/>"Get that camera out of my face!" screams Erica Carlyle. "My brother's been dead for three years! Stop bothering me!"<br/><br/>"Jimmy," says Francis, grabbing him by the lapel, "let's take a walk."<br/><br/>"Sue those bastards, Bradley!" screams Erica as Jimmy gets dragged away.<br/><br/>Focus on Jimmy Wright: black sheep of a good family, managed not to go to war in '17, but dropped out of lawschool anyway. And his aggrieved un-mentor, Francis O'Donnell: working class stiff made good, altar boy, med student who dropped out to go to France. A study in contrasts. <br/><br/>Francis met Jimmy a few months earlier. He was on an adultery stakeout when he kept getting some inept young man who was clearly tailing his mark in all his photographs; it seems that Jimmy, having read a few pulps, decided Private Eye would be a good way to make some money without working hard. Eventually, tired of having his cases wrecked by this would-be competitor, Francis began to teach Jimmy his trade. Now he has trouble keeping the guy out of his hair.<br/><br/>"You can't go taking pictures of people when their lawyers are standing next to them!" hisses Francis.<br/><br/>"Hi, Bradley Grey, attorney-at-law!" says a young man, walking up to them.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, go take some pictures of Freddie Blakely. He's some useless hanger-on. Over there, by the vaudevillians!"<br/><br/>"You mean those guys he's playing strip poker with? The Marx Brothers?"<br/><br/>"Wait, Jimmy Wright?" says Bradley. "Didn't we go to law school together? How are you? Practicing law?"<br/><br/>"I'm working on another job now."<br/><br/>"That's great. I may have something for you..."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The stars are finally beginning to fade when Jax walks out on the pier to take the air and clear her head. At the end of it, next to a blue light, she sees a figure standing.<br/><br/>"Freddie?"<br/><br/>"Ah, Jackson! Bit chilly out, don't you think? I seem to have lost most of my clothing."<br/><br/>"Take my wrap."<br/><br/>"Thanks."<br/><br/>"Is this your place?"<br/><br/>"Don't be foolish. It's illegal to have alcohol."<br/><br/>"Yeah, but is it your place?"<br/><br/>"Not technically. One rents, you know."<br/><br/>"You never wrote me. All those months when I was reporting from the front, with the Germans trying to blow my head off."<br/><br/>"I tried to write you, but I didn't know where you were."<br/><br/>"What are you doing, Freddie? Why are you in New York?"<br/><br/>"Well, I knew this bloke, you see? Going to marry some cove down on Bleeker Street. Agatha didn't take to that. Well, I failed spectacularly--they live up in Westchester, expecting their second--and I thought it best not to go back to England given that the Aunts would have my entrails on a platter. What about you? I thought you were in Russia?"<br/><br/>"Nope. Was in India, for a while. Anyway, been four years since I was there. And like I said, John Reed has his head up his..."<br/><br/>"You seem to know a remarkable number of men like that, Jax."<br/><br/>"Yeah. Must be a character flaw," she says, with a pointed stare.<br/><br/>"Not me. I couldn't find my ass with both hands if I sat on it."<br/><br/>"You were never going to marry me, were you."<br/><br/>"On the contrary, I thought I gave it a good go. You had a larger number of positive characteristics. You are rather entertaining, and you'd cause Agatha's head to explode."<br/><br/>"Typical of you, Freddie. I never heard anything else than that from you." She turns to go.<br/><br/>"I'm...rather fond of you, old girl."<br/><br/>She stops.<br/><br/>"You're not going to go and leave your shawl out here?" asks Freddie. "I still need it. You might as well stay until I don't need it."<br/><br/>"You are the most infuriating man I know," says Jax, sitting down next to him and putting her head on his shoulder.<br/><br/>Back at the tattered remnants of the party, Bradley corners Jimmy again. "Jimmy. I heard you're doing some investigations these days. Let's just say a client of a client of mine is investigating...that girl you came in with. It could be worth your while if you could provide some information about her whereabouts, what's she doing...that sort of thing."<br/><br/>"I'm familiar with her," says Jimmy slowly.<br/><br/>"There could be three...maybe four figures in it for you."<br/><br/>"A client of a client?"<br/><br/>"Let's just say a large organization with multinational reach. Who might not like certain books that she wrote about...certain parts of their polity."<br/><br/>"Something tells me that this is a bad thing to go into...though, four figures..."<br/><br/>"<i>Low</i> four figures, Jimmy. Drop by my office tomorrow."<br/><br/><br/>Francis is standing by the swimming pool. Jimmy finds him and explains Bradley's offer, hopping with excitement, blissfully unaware that Jax is Francis' cousin.<br/><br/>"You tell them..." says Francis, slowly, "that Jax is going back to Russia.

And so, utterly appropriate :-D<br/><br/>Point of fact, I think of the songs I've used as inspiration for episode titles, only "L'Internationale" was even approximately contemporary. I may even insert "Les Feuilles Mortes" into the actual game world--I can't find a date for when Pr\xe9vert actually wrote it, as opposed to when it was published (1946, in <i>Paroles</i>), so it's not such a stretch that somebody might have picked it up as a song subject. Kosma was nowhere near Paris in the '20s, but...I allow myself one major anachronism per session.

I just got back to New York," Jackson says when Francis tells her he's taking her to Paris.<br/><br/>"It's not safe here. There are people after you."<br/><br/>"Let them come! I'm perfectly safe from the Brits here! It's not like they have an extradition treaty or anything!"<br/><br/>"Actually, Jax, they do."<br/><br/>"Damnit. And my mother was Canadian, so technically I could be a British subject." She brightens up. "Don't worry, Francis. I got it under control. I know the guy throwing these parties, he'll take care of it. And then there's always Charlie if that doesn't work."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"What do you mean I gotta go?" shouts Jax at Freddie.<br/><br/>"Seems like the obvious solution. If you stay in New York, you can't be protected."<br/><br/>"Are you going to Paris with me?"<br/><br/>"Heavens no. The Aunts would destroy me! It's only twenty miles across the Channel!"<br/><br/>"To hell with you. To hell with all of you. To hell with you, Frank. And Jimmy, you're not getting paid by me!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jax storms off just as the sun comes up. A rather mousy looking woman finds Freddie standing sorrowfully by the gate.<br/><br/>"Good morning, Mr. Blakely. The agency sent me, you have a position open for a secretary? My name's Sheila--Sheila Brisbane."<br/><br/>"Adelaide?"<br/><br/>"Sheila."<br/><br/>"Abigail?"<br/><br/>"Sheila--forget about it. You'll get it eventually."<br/><br/>"Great party," says Bradley Grey, leading an inebriated Erica out to his car. "Say, Freddie, you could probably use a lawyer. Here's my card."<br/><br/>As they drive away, Erica says to Bradley, "Are you sure you want him as a client?"<br/><br/>"Absolutely. He's some rich guy from England--good family, he'll never get in trouble. I'll milk him for his retainer, easy money!"<br/><br/><br/><i>[Aftermath! Here were the results:<br/><br/><b>Jimmy: 18 Black, lucky bastard!</b></i><br/><br/>Jimmy does get paid, even though Jax never goes to Russia. With the money he gets from Bradley Grey, he starts his own agency--James Wright Investigations, James Wright, Esq., proprietor. He continues to do jobs for Bradley and his rich clients, eventually setting up in reasonable style in Midtown.<br/><br/><b>Francis: 7 White, pretty good.</b><br/><br/>Jax doesn't get arrested, somehow. Occasionally Francis sees ads for Jimmy's agency. Eventually, he gets fed up and moves to Paris, where he finds a decent cold water flat in Montmartre while he studies for the French bar. He sets up as a private detective and meets a newspaperman named Mickey Mahoney.<br/><br/>"Always good to meet another son o' the sod. Ye speak Irish?"<br/><br/>"Just Latin."<br/><br/>"I don't speak a word of it either, have to bring the boy in to translate for me when we do the Irish edition. Listen, I could use a boy like you, likely lad for certain errands."<br/><br/>"I don't move women."<br/><br/>"Ach, that's for the damn English! We'll get along famously, you and I..."<br/><br/><b>Freddie: White 0, Disastrous!</b><br/><br/>The disastrous result of his long-planned for reunion crushes Freddie. His parties become a bore, and people stop coming. His Aunts finally find out about his extravagance, and cut him off; he turns to working for Dahlia's spiritualist rag, <i>The Golden Sentinel</i>, and drinking until publicly disorderly.<br/><br/><b>Jax: White 6. Not too bad.</b><br/><br/>Jax's book does well. She begins to compile evidence on Erica Carlyle's brother...<br/><br/>And then she dies, in February 1925.<br/><br/>In Paris, Francis--now working exclusively as a PI, following the death of his wife, reads about Jackson's death in the International Herald Tribune. He is shocked to see pictures of Freddie sitting in the front row at Jax's funeral. He finds out from her editor about Jackson's investigation, and begins to make his own followup.<br/><br/>Then one day at Mahoney's office he sees Freddie Blakely again. And Jimmy Wright.<br/><br/>Jimmy is in Paris because of Bradley Grey. "Listen," the candidate for District Attorney had told him in New York, "Erica's really upset about this whole Jackson Elias mess. She doesn't want anybody poking around into her brother's death. Between you and me, the guy was a waste of air. So, go see if you can chase down the leads Jackson was following and let me know what you find so we can get ahead of this.

I've run the non-mythos adventure from the MoN Companion, and am trying to figure out which versions of which handouts to print for next time. Yours are lovely, but I didn't gender flip Elias, and I don't know how mean I want to be to him (you know, apart from having him die horribly). I love the French MoN handouts, and would like to own a copy of the book, but most of the handouts are in French, obviously, which isn't ideal for my purposes.<br/><br/>I like the "Easiest grand I ever made" line. For Freddie... I might be tempted to have N. offer to return Elias to life, all happy to be with Freddie and sane enough and all, for the small cost of ceasing to thwart N, maybe thwarting others' attempts to thwart him. Thing is, for this to work, FP needs to be willing to either accept or reject this -- either is totally fine -- rather than try to game the system so Freddie gets Elias _and_ thwarts N. Some players are cool with this, but others don't like limited options and try to break them open. Of course, even that's fine if one is willing to run with it, but Noir, even NoirPulp, should mean there are costs and no free lunch.<br/><br/>How much does N. intend to play with Freddie, given he's already peeled away a language, just as he did with Elias?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421445/#Comment_421445" name="Item_262" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-12T20:24:20+00:00" title="September 12, 2013  8:24PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the Aftermath results.

BTW, he loses French in Episode VIII, and will continue to lose languages every so often; N sees it as a bonding experience.<br/><br/>I like making props, and it's a Cthulhu RPGing tradition to have them, so I put some work into them, especially the journal; I'll have to show you the actual (as opposed to electronic) version some time. Feel free to rip off anything I've done; a find and replace could fix a lot of my gonzoness.<br/><br/>My own thinking about N and what he's up to and how much he cares about what the PCs do is...evolving. I mean, why would he even bother, right? He could always just show up, manifest in one of his really bad forms, and scrape what's left of the PCs off his shoes later. But he doesn't do that. Point of fact, it's his human minions that seem to be the ones investing effort in getting rid of the PCs. This requires some pondering.<br/><br/>Jimmy's Drive is Bad Luck, but his seems to be manifesting as "stuff going okay for me and raining poo down on everyone near me" which is fun for the gameplay. Francis brought some noir intensity to Session VII (he missed the following session, but we got GP and CP back). So the group dynamics seem to be shifting nicely.<br/><br/>As for Freddie and your idea for tempting him...there's a zero percent chance, IMHO, that FP wouldn't try to game it, at least not at first. OTOH...well, wait til the Episode VII writeup. I built up for a while towards the Sheila situation hitting the wall, and it's going to be interesting how that plays out in Episode IX.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421448/#Comment_421448" name="Item_264" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-12T20:52:20+00:00" title="September 12, 2013  8:52PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, can you give me a link if possible to the French handouts?

I mean, why would he even bother, right? He could always just show up, manifest in one of his really bad forms, and scrape what's left of the PCs off his shoes later. But he doesn't do that. Point of fact, it's his human minions that seem to be the ones investing effort in getting rid of the PCs. This requires some pondering.</blockquote>\nA few thoughts.<br/><br/>Lovecraft didn't worry too much about total consistency, given this was a mythos, a myth cycle, and such things ted to have odd gaps. When one gets a full blown campaign, these gaps start to become an issue.<br/><br/>N. is generally inconsistent from the beginning. Why is he trapped inside the pyramid for centuries? I mean, this is a being who can teleport his priestess from Kenya to the USA, inserting full knowledge of 20th century USA culture and technology into her head. Why did he wait until the 20th century to set up getting himself freed? I mean, sure, we can go with "He had to wait until the stars were right", but that's a bit weak.<br/><br/>It can be useful -- when I ran my original campaign (not CoC, but a homebrew I called Cthulhupunk, at least two years before SJG came out with GURPS Cthulhupunk), in my game world, N. was imprisoned until 1925, and that explained why mythos things were only now coming to a head. There was a lot more weirdness than the mythos out there (I used NightLife, among other things), so that worked well.<br/><br/>But also, one of the reasons we love N. and keep coming back to him is that he's got personality. He's a tempter. He loves to corrupt. Sure, he could blast the PCs, but it's just more fun to corrupt them. And, if he can't do that, it's more fun to have them watch as all their efforts fail. You've turned that up to eleven with what he did to Jax -- that's sadism as an art form.<br/><br/>(Compare to the first Hellblazer movie, where the villain kept a victim or two alive because he respected them and felt they deserved to see what he was trying to bring about -- it's not a normal or sane thing, perhaps, but it was internally consistent and justified keeping one character alive as something other than idiot plottig.)<br/><br/>N. as artist is another reason he doesn't just destroy his enemies, wave his hand, and make what he wants happen. As a friend of mine put it, he's a grandmaster of chess, but he doesn't want to sweep in and win in a gauche, brutal way. He wants to play out the elaborate game he's planned, leading his opponent into ever more complicated traps. Sure, if he's worried he'll actually lose, he can pull out the brute force (unless you decide he's amused enough to give the monkeys their victory for a few decades or milennia, but as long as he's confident, he will do a slow game, pausing to pretend he's playing fair as he allows his opponents to react. His minions don't get this about him, and are convinced they have to help his plans along -- and he no doubt encourages this. Or maybe he doesn't.<br/><br/>The things that seem to have surprised him were Charleston turning him down, Pearkes giving him the sword, and Freddie being... well, Freddie.<br/><br/>But yes, is there a real possibility of victory for the PCs? Or is everything they do foreseen? What will your group accept?

I've decided that I don't like what was done with Huston. I mean, here's this guy, ahead of his time in some ways -- studying with Freud and Jung at a time when their theories were radical and often looked down on. And he ditched an old career -- and a wife -- to get that far, even before the Imelda Bosch mess. I'd forgotten that, because it's completely irrelevant as written.<br/><br/>This is a man who was suave and dangerous in the right ways to become the confidante of many of New York's monied families, again, in an age where what he was doing as a psychoanalyst was looked down upon.<br/><br/>And... he wants to rule the world so he can indulge himself. He globe trots with thugs who have nothing better to do than take potshots at the PCs. Or, he sits in Australia and cackles manically while admonishing his minions to practice their Shrivelling spells for the test. Complete disconnect.<br/><br/>I mean, if you've got The Stars Are Right, look at "Nemo Solis Sapit" for a lovely way for a psychoanalyst to go round the bend due to mythos knowledge. I'm tempted to try to work that line -- but I don't want to get away from the core of Masks.<br/><br/>It also occurs to me that Imelda Bosch's her death was news, even if the suicide angle was hushed. Presumably, she was of some means. I don't know how much time I want to spend playing with that, given I'm running on Sunday. Huston presumably started the affair. Certainly, he broke it off. Why? As far as I can tell, he doesn't feel guilty about any of it, merely afraid that the scandal will come out.<br/><br/>Does he really want to rule the world? This seems more like someone wanting to be an eminent gris. And he probably thinks of himself as a ladies' man, apparently not without justification. Certainly, this is a far cry from the wild eyed nigh drooling figure in the thumbnail sketch.<br/><br/>Penhew's weird, but his weirdness gives me more of a handle on him. He wants to be a pharaoh. Pretty much everything flows from that. Masters is too simple, and I'm not sure how much I want to change, if anything, there, but at least the pieces fit the puzzle.<br/><br/>It's actually fascinating to compare Masters and Huston. She had an abortion. He drove a lover to suicide (indeed, one could decide he actively drove her to suicide, using his knowledge of her psychology...). Masters is consumed by guilt and wants to undo her deed. Huston just doesn't want to get caught. Masters slots easily into the role of mother-to-be, while Huston wonders what his role will be. Masters is being destroyed by being given what she wants and realizing The Awful Truth. Huston... well, yes, suddenly he's testing Shrivelling spell casting.

Realistically, he could be one of the most dangerous opponents the PCs face--a sorcerer, and a psychologist; he could keep one step ahead of them constantly, and taunt them to maximum effect.<br/><br/>Since I have no urgent need to preserve fidelity to the text--<i>ahem</i>--I have of course changed around more than a few things, although I'm still working on how to get Huston in; I think I'm approaching the time to start. I kind of like the idea of him being the chessmaster troubleshooter. Of course, I've got other stuff going on in my game. Hypatia clearly has an agenda, and seems to be using the PCs as her cat's paws to take out members of the conspiracy she doesn't like (she admits as much in Episode VIII)--but why?<br/><br/>Actually, but Why? is an excellent question. As I said at the beginning of this gonzo quest, I find the motivations and the characterizations of the NPCs to be one of the weakest things in most RPG writing. <i>Masks</i> is better than most, but still no exception. And I've always had a problem with the apocalyptic cult thing being over-used. Lovecraft actually had relatively few of those, and relatively few head-wound crazy sorcerers; even Joseph Curwen had motives that were not "end the world as we know it."<br/><br/>In fact, "destroying the world just cause" is basically the motivation only in "The Call of Cthulhu" and that's because The Big C is better than anyone at driving folks around the bend in ways that are useful to him. For long-form entertainment, it kind of sucks as an answer; I think that there's a reason that a) Lovecraft never wrote any novels and b) his novellas don't use "crazy" as the rationale for why humans are doing what they do.<br/><br/>But that's just me.

That said...it's a bit too easy, and too dismissive, to just have it be the cults. (One of the conspiracy members is very much anti-colonial, but that hasn't gotten into play yet.)<br/><br/>Thinking about it over the weekend gave me some good ideas...which you'll have to wait to see; spoilers, and I'd like them to cook a bit more. I just want--need--there to be some kind of <i>reason</i> that can be given for why the conspiracy wants to pull this off. After all, according to the <i>Masks</i> text, if the gate opens the GOOs show up and use humanity as sushi or something. Why folks would want to kick that off...I just can't see it. You're forced to fall back on a) they are driven completely 'round the bend by what they've learned and so make a completely irrational choice or b) they're being lied to by the entities in charge.<br/><br/>A) is dramatically unsatisfying; it's the "just because" rationale. But <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> sucks a bit too, as it means the conspiracy, which is supposed to be sooo scary and have at least one chessmaster, isn't smart enough to figure out that they're dooming the human race and themselves. You can make that work in a story, but it definitely diminishes the Bad Guys and usually is used only to set up a Heel-Face Turn or a Just Desserts ending.<br/><br/>And those are great! But not what I'm trying to cook up. I want to get some NPCs with psychological depth and motivations that PCs could respect. Of course, some of that is driven by the Ha <i>Ha!</i> nature of doing a reboot like this, where occasionally you need a dramatic reversal or two, or other deep variation from the source. (Like, for example, I've pretty much decided on the idea that Gavigan isn't magic. I like the idea of somebody getting to the top of the cult without being a sorcerer; and it reinforces my mental image of G as incredibly determined and willing to do whatever it takes to come out on top.)<br/><br/>Anyway, my US$ .02, for what it's worth. I understand I am basically incredibly far from anything remotely purist, but I embraced that destiny a long time ago :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421578/#Comment_421578" name="Item_278" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-16T20:14:44+00:00" title="September 16, 2013  8:14PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: Mais la vie s\xe9pare ceux qui s'aiment (Part 1)</b><br/><br/><i>Monday, 11 May 1925</i><br/><br/>After a few days in the clink, Freddie manages to hire a lawyer with the right requirements (Sorbonne graduate, name with a <i>de</i> in the middle.)

This Edouard Gavigan may claim to be a graduate of the Ecole Diplomatique and have dinner with the President twice a year at the Elys\xe9e Palace, but he's no Frenchman. He was born Eddie Gaffigan. An Ulsterman, and a bad 'un. In 1915, he was a bombmaker and assassin for a pro-Independence militia. But in 1916, during the rising, he was in a unit of the British Army, one commanded by our old friend Sir Aubrey Penhew. Seems this Gaffigan betrayed some members of his old unit, led them into an ambush and they was all massacred."<br/><br/>"So he switched sides," says Freddie. "Why haven't some of his old friends tried to--well--"<br/><br/>"I happen to know that there have been at least three attempts on his life, by some boys who knew what they were about. Not only did all three fail, but the lads were never heard from again. He's rich, aye, and tight with everybody important in the Third Republic, but what that would do to keep him out of a coffin, I don't know. Has an impeccable reputation as a philanthropist. So, not the kind of man to be frightened by sticking a gun in his face.<br/><br/>"Now, this Mr. Gavigan happens to own, via a bunch of dummy companies, a castle in Ireland, just south of the Ulster line--"<br/><br/>"That must piss you off," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You have the American talent for understatement. He also has a villa on some island near Venice, and has some kind of connection to the fella that owns the Blue Pyramid nightclub--or rather, owned; it's being sold to some American. If you'll be needing transport to either, I've got a plane that can take you."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"I still can't believe you never told me you're Jax's cousin," says Freddie, entering his hotel suite.<br/><br/>"I think I've spoken about fifty-nine words to you in my life," says Francis. "So it didn't exactly come up."<br/><br/>"Well, you look nothing like her."<br/><br/>"Freddie--Mr. Blakely--is there anything you need?" asks Sheila.<br/><br/>"I'll need to change--oh, and clothes for Scotty and Donnie here, I'm meeting with this Gavigan fellow."<br/><br/>"Oh. You're going to lunch? I guess I'm not invited."<br/><br/>"Well you could come. In your capacity as my personal clerk."<br/><br/>"I'm much to busy anyway, and I have nothing to wear." She heads downstairs to hail a cab.<br/><br/>"Do I need to tell you to give yourself a raise again?" shouts Freddie after her.<br/><br/>"Already did!"<br/><br/><br/>When Freddie gets downstairs, the manager meets with him. Very apologetically, he tells Freddie that he must leave the hotel. When Freddie asks for recommendations, the manager hems and haws. Freddie soon gets the picture: he's socially radioactive, and none of the better hotels will have him as a guest.<br/><br/>"We're getting <i>kicked out</i>?" huffs Sheila. "Fine. I will take care of it. This is ridiculous..."<br/><br/><i>[And with this, I declared the long guerrilla campaign for Sheila Brisbane's soul.]</i><br/><br/><br/>At <a href="http://www.latourdargent.com/restaurant/la-carte/entrees" rel="nofollow">La Tour d'Argent</a>, Jimmy gets a table near the private room Gavigan has reserved for Francis and Freddie. Blakely is kept icing his heels for over an hour before finally getting led to the table. Jimmy notes that there are couple of men obviously keeping guns under their coats standing guard on the private room.<br/><br/><i>[I've never managed to eat at La Tour d'Argent; take a look at the link to the menu above and you may guess why!

I don't think they all do. The anti-colonialism you've already covered. I remember a friend telling me about her parents being Communists and explaining that, when this happened, there were a lot of disenfranchised folks in the USA who believed that Communism was the only thing that offered hope of positive change. Later on, she said, it became clear, at least to most, that the Soviet Union didn't really give a dang about supporters in the USA beyond what those supporters were prepared to do for them.<br/><br/>For some, there's the become-part-of-a-god bit or become part of True Reality. And I'm sure others delude themselves into thinking they'll be rewarded in ways that make sense to them. Huston, as written, believes he will rule the world and hasn't grasped that the world will be a burnt cider. Penhew wants to be a pharaoh and is convinced this will be his just reward. And, strictly speaking, he's correct, according to the text. It just doesn't mean what he thinks it will mean. It's a bit like sending Psyche down to Hades to ask Persephone for Beauty. The Beauty of Hades doesn't mean what Persephone thinks it means.<br/><br/>There's the religious aspect. Maybe I don't particularly like the idea of the End Times coming, but I believe they will come -- Crowley wrote in Magick Without Tears (which I'm told is as close as he gets to being straightforward in his writing) that he didn't like the message of The Book of the Law, but whether he did or not, that's just how things were.<br/><br/>Either way, it's both fun and useful to ponder the motives of cultists.

It was there with Shakhti's followers, but then Shakhti's cult wasn't underclass, it was a club for the powerful and he used religion pretty obviously in its role as the handmaiden of state action. (Plus, he may be sophisticated, but at bottom he's still the Bronze Age ruler of a small city-state.)<br/><br/>I think it's impossible to separate the cults as Lovecraft depicts them from Lovecraft's own well-known racism. I mean, they're always furtive, usually swarthy foreigners infiltrating upright society and bringing it down. (Yes, okay, the Mi-Go cult in "The Whisperer in the Darkness" isn't, but then they have an actual rationale--they sell out part of the planet in exchange for a lot of power; same goes for the Great Race's helper cult.) Sometimes your source material...isn't so awesome, so if you're reinterpreting it, you have to take pains to avoid those pratfalls. (Ronald D. Moore, white courtesy phone please.)<br/><br/>It happens in all kinds of stuff. I'm a huge Chandler fan, and I understand why <i>Farewell, My Lovely</i> was his own favorite novel--in a lot of ways, it's the best written and most intriguing, with a ton of good characters and the most homoerotic scene in the books, which is saying something. But my goodness, the racism in the book is appalling--maybe not "The Horror in Red Hook" bad, but still pretty awful.<br/><br/>The battle for Sheila's soul...well, spoilers, so you'll have to wait for more updates, sorry. However, I wanted to explore the idea that there are more ways to attack a Source than just physical or mental assault. Sheila was always in a kind of bad place--hopelessly in love with a man-child who himself was in love with a ghost. So if somebody just gave her a little push in a different direction...well, her relationship might crumble and expose Freddie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421629/#Comment_421629" name="Item_282" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-17T19:47:54+00:00" title="September 17, 2013  7:47PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: Mais la vie s\xe9pare ceux qui s'aiment (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>Freddie and Francis are ushered into a private room. Gavigan is sitting with his weasly looking <i>avocat</i>.<br/><br/>"Monsieur Blakely, thank you for coming. I hope we can put these...contentious circumstances to rest," says Gavigan.<br/><br/>"No worries, Eddie, I'm sure it will be fine."<br/><br/>"Ah, Mr. Blakely, I know you have been in <i>l'Am\xe9rique</i> for some time, but here we do not go for <i>l'informalit\xe9</i>. But if you wish to call me Edouard, we are on that level."<br/><br/>"Of course, Mr. Gaffigan."<br/><br/>"Ah, I know your French is not so sophisticated, but it is pronounced <i>Gavigan</i>."<br/><br/>"Well, I did learn it in Lyon."<br/><br/>"Wonderful food there. The other qualities are somewhat lacking."<br/><br/>"This is Mr. Francis O'Donnell, my...<i>avocat</i>."<br/><br/>"Ah, your lawyer. I'm afraid I don't recognize the name from the court papers. No matter."<br/><br/>"It seems that much like the best hotels, the best lawyers are suddenly unavailable to me."<br/><br/>"What can I say, monsieur? In Paris, one must always be aware of one's social position. Some things--such as threatening an important member of society in his office--are not done. And the Colonel, could only be <i>your</i> associate, after all. And much as it pains me to say so, your own history with the constabularies of several cities have created an arrest record that would make a passable Russian novel."<br/><br/>Outside, the maitre d' and a large waiter come up to Jimmy. "I'm sorry, monsieur, this table has been reserved. Tragic oversight. But you must leave. The meal, do not worry about it."<br/><br/>"Monsieur would not want to make a scene," purrs the waiter.<br/><br/>"I am a lawyer," starts Jimmy. "A very good one. And if you kick me out--on your fault--you will have hell to pay."<br/><br/>The two speak rapidly in French. They look at Jimmy. Finally they slink away.<br/><br/><i>[Intimidation use by Jimmy.]</i><br/><br/>"So, monsieur," continues Gavigan, "this social disaster, should be ended. I am happy to offer you a settlement now that the Colonel has returned to England."<br/><br/>He hands Blakely a paper with a large figure written on it.<br/><br/>"That's quite generous," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"You misunderstand," says Gavigan, "<i>you</i> will pay <i>me</i>."<br/><br/>Francis and Freddie confer.<br/><br/>"We are also willing to negotiate," says Gavigan, "although you are clearly wrong. Right now this is a civil matter, but--Devil's Island is lovely this time of year."<br/><br/>"I would think you'd be a bit generous, given that I prevented you from coming to harm," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"I was in no real danger," says Gavigan.<br/><br/>"And I was the one who was hurt. I still have the bandages."<br/><br/>"I am willing to waive the fee, if you tell me about this alleged meeting with Hypatia Masters."<br/><br/>"Would this be easier if I switched to French?" says Freddie in French.<br/><br/>"Yes, although you speak it like a whore," says Gavigan in the same language.<br/><br/>Francis, who is fluent in French, nods blankly and acts as if he does not understand.<br/><br/>"Tell me about Miss Masters," says Gavigan. "It is impossible that you have met her, but I wish to know what it is that you saw."<br/><br/>"It was more along the lines of one of those, whaddaya call 'em, effing lucid dreams. I met her in a dream, in Arabia."<br/><br/><i>[I turned off my French accent at this point, and FP switched into a slangy intonation to match his "Lyonaise" accent.]</i><br/><br/>"What do you mean?"<br/><br/>"One minute I'm in Arabia, the next in a nightclub. Middle of Arabia."<br/><br/>"Near a place called Irem?"<br/><br/>"Don't know. But it was quite definitely a dream, because in the Empty Quarter, there aren't fountains of water."<br/><br/>Gavigan switches to English. "I'm sorry, sir, this is no longer a matter for the lawyers."<br/><br/>"If we stay in French," says Freddie, "Francis can't understand us. He's thoroughly American."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance buy by FP.]</i><br/><br/>"Irem of the PIllars is a fantasy, it does not exist. And you claim you met Hypatia Masters in a dream. What did she say she was planning to do."<br/><br/>"Something about world domination--changing the fate of things--returning...mostly she spoke to Mr. Chiu."<br/><br/>"One other thing. I believe you met a contact of mine in Egypt. Omar Shakhti Bey."<br/><br/>"Ah, that bastard. He tried to kill me."<br/><br/>"Do you know his current location?"<br/><br/>"I assume in his villa."<br/><br/>"You give me the lie, sir. He is missing."<br/><br/>"Well, in my dream, Hypatia killed him. But that was just a dream."<br/><br/>"Very well. I hope you find the agreement satisfactory, as it will avoid prosecution and the stripping of a large portion of your wealth."<br/><br/>"Or yours. I was the injured party."<br/><br/>"Mr. Blakely, I will be frank. This is the Third Republic. If you think you can find a magistrate willing to swear out a complaint against me, you are welcome to try. But you are not French. My attorney will contact your...attorney."<br/><br/>"He really has a degree."<br/><br/>"Yes. They give out all kinds of degrees in America."<br/><br/><i>[Francis has points in both Law and Medicine--his story is that he dropped out of Med school to go to the war, and studied law in Paris.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie and Francis leave just as Jimmy's lunch arrives. Freddie tries to join him, but the waiters wave him off--sorry, almost time to close til dinner--and we just can't let people sit anywhere you want? What are you, some kind of stinking democrat?<br/><br/>"A dream?" says Francis suspiciously as they slide into a taxi.<br/><br/>"Some kind of magical fugue state. He knows I lied, but only about it being a dream. Though it does make it clear why Mickey's friends never came back."<br/><br/>They head back to the hotel they were evicted from, but they have neither a room nor a forwarding address--apparently Sheila did not leave one.<br/><br/>"I have a couch," says Francis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421650/#Comment_421650" name="Item_283" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-18T14:22:30+00:00" title="September 18, 2013  2:22PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, basically, Sheila's ticked enough to have walked out, at least for the moment, after telling her boss she'd take care of it?<br/><br/>I'm curious about the relationships between the cult members.

I think it adds a fun dimension to him.<br/><br/>Sheila doesn't vanish this episode. Mwu-ha-ha...<br/><br/>I'm still working on the various relationships, and some are spoilerific, but: M'Weru and Shakhti were deadly rivals. M'Weru is N's favorite, and she can generally use that status to cow the other members of the conspiracy--except for Shakhti, who was old and powerful enough to not care. (She could influence him, but only by calling on N himself, which was galling.)<br/><br/>Hypatia gets along with M'Weru, and didn't like Shakhti; there are hints that they had a centuries-long rivalry. Whatever Hypatia did to become...Hypatia...seems to have annoyed Shakhti, most likely because it ramped up her power level and somehow has left her a more-or-less free agent.<br/><br/>Gavigan's been the public face of the cult since Penhew "died" in 1919, and de facto head of all operations in Europe. This gives him an enormous amount of power, but he has to balance out the various rivalries--M'Weru doesn't take orders from anyone, and now that Hypatia's back Gavigan has major headaches. He seems to have gotten along well enough with Shakhti (probably because he let Shakhti run his own sphere as he saw fit) and Tewfik is his main cult resource (Tewfik is also a sorcerer, unlike Gavigan.) Tewfik presents his own problems as he was Shakhti's protege and more devoted to him than he could ever be to a European adventurer like Gavigan.<br/><br/>Huston and Penhew haven't made any appearances yet, and I'm working on their relationship. Penhew seems to be letting things stay hands-off as he works on his own projects. Huston...I have some ideas on that, but they should come in to the next couple of sessions.<br/><br/>There's also a mysterious figure behind the rest of the conspirators. Jax only called him the "Old Man" and nobody knows anything about him as of yet; I'm pretty sure the PCs don't even realize he exists. (If folks actually read the diary closely, they would realize that the appointment Jax had at the Hotel New Yorker was with him. Folks don't read closely.)<br/><br/>I have basically worked out what exactly the conspiracy is up to, and it seems to make sense to me, but I'll probably be rewriting that right up to the end of the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421657/#Comment_421657" name="Item_285" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-18T20:01:01+00:00" title="September 18, 2013  8:01PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2013 8:01PM by Aviatrix.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: Mais la vie s\xe9pare ceux qui s'aiment (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>Francis and Freddie head back to Mahoney's.

Jimmy walks her to a M\xe9tro station, and then drops the journal off to get a typescript made of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie and Francis talk for some time, about Jax, and her quest, and whether Francis believes in magic (he doesn't). And Hypatia Masters, and her duel with a five thousand year old vampire.<br/><br/>Francis asks about the Blue Pyramid. He treats the idea of human trafficking with disgust. "And these guys are the ones after you here and in England?"<br/><br/>"That seems to be about the size of it."<br/><br/>"I have a friend who knows quite a bit about the nightclub life in Paris. I'm going to run this by him."<br/><br/>Francis finds his partner Guy Forgeron at his favorite cafe. "Fran\xe7ois! This is Bunny, and this is Jen. They are American co-eds visiting Paris! Isn't that fantastique?"<br/><br/>"Listen, Guy. Do you know about this place the Blue Pyramid?"<br/><br/>Guy of course knows it well. He explains that there is a man who "owns" it--an Egyptian named Abdul Nawisha. But the real owner is a spice merchant named Tewfik al-Sayed, another Egyptian.<br/><br/>"But the thing about Le Pyramide Bleu is that it is being bought, buy some American--nobody seems to know exactly what is going on."<br/><br/>"Thanks, Guy. I'll call your wife soon and tell her I sent you on a stake-out."<br/><br/>"A job--oh, I see what you are doing. Tell her I love her. Now girls! This drink is called absinthe..."<br/><br/>On the way to the M\xe9tro, Freddie suddenly finds several of these posters plastered everywhere:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/8706/zty8.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421747/#Comment_421747" name="Item_286" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-21T20:06:38+00:00" title="September 21, 2013  8:06PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, now, that was interesting.

Freddie is smoking at the tiny window. Across the narrow alley Francis' neighbor waves at him. <br/><br/>"Bon soir, Fran\xe7ois." He hands Freddie back a bottle of wine they are sharing.<br/><br/>"Martin has great insults!" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"You hear about that crazy American, Shipley?" Martin asks Francis. "He's making lots of money."<br/><br/>Francis nods at Martin--like many inhabitants of Montmartre, he's a painter. "Haven't heard of him."<br/><br/>The apartment is small, but well-kept, perched on the top floor of a dilapidated but neat building. A communal bathroom is at the end of the hall. Inside the apartment there is a living room with a small kitchenette. Two couches face each other--Freddie is to sleep on one; the other looks like it is frequently used as a bed. A tiny bedroom in the back holds a brass bed, carefully made up, that shows no signs of having been slept in recently at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy meets Sheila at a tourist bar on the Left Bank. "How's it doing?"<br/><br/>"Better. I talked to Muriel, that always makes me feel better."<br/><br/>"Who is this Muriel?"<br/><br/>"She's a doctor--an African. She's traveled with us since New York. She's really brilliant--she's a medical doctor, she studied with Jung, and an anthropologist. She makes me want to do more with my life, you know? I mean, I could be more than a secretary. I went to teacher's college for two years! I could be a teacher! Or a doctor! It's not like I'm living in my mom's world, I mean, I can vote now."<br/><br/>"Here's your journal back."<br/><br/>"Oh, thanks! I wasn't sure I was going to see that again, actually."<br/><br/>"I am an honest man."<br/><br/>"I know that now." Sheila pauses. "Listen, Jimmy, are you going back to the States anytime soon? Because I kinda want to go home. I love Paris, but I don't have anybody to do it with. I mean...in Cairo he said he was going to spend a lot of time with me, and protect me...but I haven't seen much of him since."<br/><br/>"Well, you know...we have really short lives."<br/><br/>"I know! People have tried to kill me. You're right. I'm going to book a trip back, make Freddie pay for it, then give him my resignation. No wait. I'm going to spend a week in London first! Then I'll go home."<br/><br/><i>Tuesday 12 May 1925</i><br/><br/>"Listen, Donnie, you're a private eye. Do you think you could turn up Sheila?" says Freddie first thing in the morning.<br/><br/>"Sure. Let me go to the bar first."<br/><br/>From a caf\xe9, Francis calls Mickey, who tells him that Sheila found a hotel in the 6th arrondissement. Francis tells Freddie, bills him for an hour, and tells him to meet him by Jimmy's hotel, the Lutetia, at four o'clock.<br/><br/>Freddie drops in at the new hotel. "What ho, Adelaide?"<br/><br/>"Where the hell have you been? Oh, whatever. It's not like you care. I'm taking the day off and going to the Louvre. If you need me to do anything, that's probably unfortunate."<br/><br/>"Is there something I've done?"<br/><br/>"No. That's really the problem. Anyway, I'm late to go see art."<br/><br/>Freddie convinces Sheila to let him go with her, desperate to placate his secretary and self-described most important person in his life.<br/><br/>Francis picks up Guy at his house. Forgeron looks like he's been sleeping on a couch too. "Those American girls have no inhibitions! I barely escaped with my life! And then Marie nearly killed me--what did you tell her?"<br/><br/>They head up to Mickey's place, where they run into Jimmy. Guy promises to set up Jimmy with his brother-in-law Gaston, who can show him the city. (He tells Francis in French that Gaston can use the money.) After swallowing his anger that Jimmy didn't follow Gavigan and his men, Francis tells Jimmy to go found out what he can about Gavigan--nobody knows him at the Foundation, so he can slip in.<br/><br/>"Arshewyeharoun' Paree," mutters Gaston, as he picks Jimmy up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the Louvre, Sheila and Freddie study the Egyptian artifacts. They find a bas-relief.<br/><br/>Freddie blinks.<br/><br/>The faces are familiar to him.<br/><br/>Penhew.<br/><br/>Huston.<br/><br/>Masters.<br/><br/>And...a strange woman, matching the photograph of "Vanessa" that they found in Jax's diary.<br/><br/>The relief dates from the time of Cheops. Freddie can recognize the style and it seems correct to him.<br/><br/><i>[Art History from Freddie, then he spent some Flattery to talk to one of the curators.]</i><br/><br/>"You're not the first person to ask about that piece," says the man, a young grad student. "About a year ago, this American woman saw it and started to scream. Very unusual, we had to call a cop to talk her down."<br/><br/>"Let me guess. About this high, brunette?"<br/><br/>"That's the one. I told her that the piece was very well dated, although to be honest, we don't know what the stone is; it's resisted all analysis. All we know is that it's...green. Maybe manufactured, although by a process we have no knowledge of."<br/><br/>"Very strange."<br/><br/>"Well...you know, about four years ago there was a break-in here. They say some robed figures were chanting around it, in some weird language. Probably Arabic. But I think that's just what they do to haze me. Still, it's a great honor to be working for the Penhew Foundation..."<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421772/#Comment_421772" name="Item_288" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-22T18:34:05+00:00" title="September 22, 2013  6:34PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: Mais la vie s\xe9pare ceux qui s'aiment (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy drops by the Fondation Aubrey Penhew. After some time, he is met by Baldur von Hasselbach, who leads him on a guided tour. <br/><br/>The Fondation building is two stories high; upstairs is a large open bullpen, where various scholars are buried in their work.<br/><br/>Jimmy notices that Baldur seems to keep reducing the amount of personal space between them. He decides to take advantage of the German's, um, interest in him. He also notices that the way the pipe and ventilation ducts are set up that there seems to be some kind of space in the basement, especially after Baldur introduces him to Gavigan. He guesses that there is some kind of room beneath the office.<br/><br/><i>[Mechanical Repair uncovered this.]</i><br/><br/>Baldur lets Jimmy study in the library (his cover story was that he is a visiting scholar.) He notices that there is a focus on a strange period of Egyptian history between the Third and Fourth dynasties--the time of a (possibly) apocryphal figure called the Black Pharaoh.<br/><br/>"You know, Jimmy, why don't we go have a drink? I have never visited America, you could tell me about it. I know an excellent caf\xe9 nearby."<br/><br/>"When would you like to meet?"<br/><br/>"I have no duties today except to show around a charming American."<br/><br/>"I would love to meet you there, but I have to look up a few things..."<br/><br/>"Oh, here? I shouldn't tell you, but I do have some brandy in my locker."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance use by JP. Flattery would have been better, but Jimmy doesn't have any.]</i><br/><br/>"Oh, you are tempting me so much..."<br/><br/>"Am I?"<br/><br/>"Well, maybe a drink or two..."<br/><br/>"Let's go into Gavigan's office. His brandy is better than mine."<br/><br/>"I like your style."<br/><br/>"I like <i>your</i> style."<br/><br/>In the office, Baldur perches fetchingly up on the desk and asks Jimmy to tell him about America, and opines how horrible it is to be in the City of Light without...romantic companionship. Jimmy, looking for a way to get into the basement, asks if Baldur could find a more intimate location. The German offers to take him into the storeroom next to Gavigan's office. Closing the door behind them, Baldur turns to Jimmy and says, "Now..."<br/><br/>Jimmy punches him. The German is so surprised that he drops to the floor, out cold.<br/><br/>The storeroom is full of old books, statuary, crates, a mummy case, books, a mummy case, some maps, waitasec a <i>mummy case</i>...<br/><br/>Jimmy investigates it. There is a discolored area near the case--as if it is moved regularly. He spends some time playing with the case, tracing the mechanism holding it to the floor, and eventually presses both of the eyes on the front of the case in. <br/><br/>Motors grind. The case moves aside, revealing a staircase. Jimmy descends into the basement, flipping on the light switch as he passes it.<br/><br/>The room is full of highly disturbing artwork. Jimmy's eyes swim as he tries to process the images of naked women being mutilated by horrible abominations.<br/><br/><i>[Failed Stability check by JP.]</i><br/><br/>He takes some snapshots anyway. On an open crate, he finds a horrific statue of some amorphous creature with sucking mouths and lurid eyes. It is labeled "The Bloated Woman" and is being shipped to Ho Fong Imports in Shanghai, China. He finds a few other crates addressed to Port Randolph, Australia. Inside is a green stone statue of a winged, bloated humanoid with what seems to be an octopus for a head.<br/><br/>Along one wall is a bookcase with locked, barred doors. Flipping out his lockpicking kit, Jimmy spends fifteen minutes getting open the doors. Inside are bizarre, ancient books. He grabs several of the ones that look the most used and tosses them into his satchel.<br/><br/><i>[Two-point Lockipicking buy, as per the conversion rules.]</i><br/><br/>As he goes through the books, one of the packing crates begins to shake.<br/><br/><i>[I have a thing. For FP (and now JP), every now and then I ask them, "What's your drive?"<br/><br/>"Bad luck..."<br/><br/>And then I bring down some pain. This was JP's first experience of it.]</i><br/><br/>The lights suddenly go out. The machine that closes the mummy case grinds as it closes the exit. A German-accented voice carries down the stairs: "Go **** yourself!"<br/><br/>Jimmy hears the box still shaking. A sound of splintering wood can be heard. He flicks open a lighter in time to see a human hand bunch through the side of the crate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, outside the Blue Pyramid, Guy and Francis meet up. "Guy, do you still have that police badge?"<br/><br/>"Sure do, Fran\xe7ois."<br/><br/>"Why don't we run the 'French Cop and American BOI agent' play?"<br/><br/>They push their way in and are intercepted by an the maitre d'. "Welcome to Le Pyramide Bleu."<br/><br/>"Hallo. This here's French police."<br/><br/>"We are very accommodating of the police." In French he says to Guy, "What the hell? We're paid up."<br/><br/>"I'm here from Virginia," continues Francis. "I'm from the Bureau of Investigation. Bee Oh Eye. We're investigating criminal activities."<br/><br/>"We are just a gentlemen's club. You are gentlemen! Please come in and sit!"<br/><br/>"We're looking into the new ownership."<br/><br/>"Of course! Please come! Sit down! Stay to the show!" He drops his voice. "I must beg you. The owner is not someone to trifle with."<br/><br/>People are filing in, mostly curiosity-seekers--far more white Parisians than is normal, according to Guy, who also says that the decor has been significantly revamped. There is a table at the front that is cordoned off with a velvet rope.<br/><br/>Francis goes to talk to the musicians, some African-American jazz players. Francis gives the trumpeter one of Freddie's expensive cigarettes. "Listen, John," says Francis. "I'm looking into the disappearance of these girls."<br/><br/>"Don't know about that, man. Just got hired. The new owner brought us in. She's got style, man."<br/><br/>"The owner is a woman? What's her name?"<br/><br/>"It's uh...um...well, I know her name."<br/><br/>"Howabout you write it down."<br/><br/>"Sure." John writes something on a card and hands it to the PI.<br/><br/>It says <i>Francis</i>.<br/><br/>"That's her name," says the musician.<br/><br/>"It's Francis?"<br/><br/>"I didn't write Francis. Listen, I better get back."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Back at the Fondation, the crate is being rapidly torn apart from the inside. Jimmy frantically looks around for something that could help him. He spies a coal oil can near the stairs--maybe he could dowse the creature in it!<br/><br/>Unfortunately it is empty.<br/><br/><i>[Failed Preparedness roll by JP.]</i><br/><br/>The crate is almost completely gone at this point. Jimmy sees what looks like a man inside. A man who is kept inside a crate, and doesn't respond to any of his attempts to talk to him.<br/><br/>Jimmy races over to a steam valve. Wrapping his hands in rags, he yanks at the wheel holding the valve shut. With a screech, it rips open. Superheated steam jets out, splashing over the man in the crate, blasting the wood to pieces and parboiling him. Jimmy yells in pain as the vapor envelopes him.<br/><br/><i>[I let Jimmy spend 2 Health for every +1 to Mechanical Repair--he had spent all of it opening the mummy case.]</i><br/><br/>Alarms start to ring from the steam pressure dropping suddenly and dramatically.<br/><br/>Jimmy races up the stairs. "Oh, that's where the fire axe was," he mutters, seeing it in a bracket at the top of the stairway. He chops through the ancient mummy case and pulls himself through. He races out into the hall, grabs a coat from the cloakroom, and sneaks out into the street, briefly passing through the milling crowd outside as the fire department arrives.<br/><br/><i>[Disguise check by Jimmy Wright--master of disguise!]</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421774/#Comment_421774" name="Item_289" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-22T19:51:31+00:00" title="September 22, 2013  7:51PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!

But...the way this developed left me nicely satisfied. And in the next episode, Freddie did something I did not expect.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>At the Blue Pyramid, a very upright gentleman in a fez takes the roped-off table in the front. Francis hazards a guess that this is Tewfik al-Sayed. The staff bring him a Turkish coffee.<br/><br/>Francis elbows in and sits down at the table. "Mr. al-Sayed?"<br/><br/>"I do not hear the words of an American infidel."<br/><br/>"TewFIK al-SayEED?"<br/><br/>"I have cut the tongue out of men for pronouncing my name in such a manner."<br/><br/>"Howabout I call you <i>Mon-sieur</i>."<br/><br/>"Call me Pasha if you wish to retain your genitalia."<br/><br/>"Can you answer some questions?"<br/><br/>"What is it you want, you annoying American?"<br/><br/>"We're investigating the disappearance of some women..."<br/><br/>"What concern is that of mine?"<br/><br/>"I understand you have an interest in this place."<br/><br/>"I do not. I merely patronize it. Everyone has heard about the disappearances. I have nothing to do with them. My women have not been touched."<br/><br/>"You extend protection to them?"<br/><br/>"I am but a simple spice merchant."<br/><br/>"Is there anything I can pass along to President Coolidge and my superiors? So I don't have to interrupt and put my American uncouthness in your coffee?"<br/><br/>"If you wish to interview me, do it at my place of business, not my place of entertainment. Now step back or I will have you disposed of, agent of President Coolidge or not!"<br/><br/>However, as Francis steps back, a flunky brings him Tewfik's business card on a silver platter. At that moment, the lights dim, and over the PA system a man solemnly intones, "Medames et Messieurs...Meinen Damen und Herren...Ladies and Gentlemen...we welcome to the Blue Pyramid.....<i>Hypatia</i>!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie and Sheila hit a few clubs near Place R\xe9publique, where they run into Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Sheila, this is..."<br/><br/>"Jimmy! What happened to your hands!"<br/><br/>"What they hell did you get me into!" says Jimmy. He explains to Freddie about his adventure at Gavigan's. <br/><br/>"Sorry I'm late. I left Guy to watch Hypatia's show," says Francis as he comes up to them. "Jimmy, you look terrible." He examines Jimmy's wounds and tells him to come by his place in the morning so he can change his dressing.<br/><br/>"Sheila, we're about to go and stop a slavery ring here in Paris. You can come along. It's easy--I just run away screaming."<br/><br/>"I can do that."<br/><br/>"So Hypatia's," begins Francis. "These people have been targeted by deep hypnosis. The musicians can't even say her name. And she does cold readings on the audience."<br/><br/>"Should we go see here?"<br/><br/>"I left Guy to watch."<br/><br/>"So you are saying she's a master of hypnosis, and you're leaving somebody to watch and report back to you."<br/><br/>"...I can see a flaw in this plan now."<br/><br/>A loud group of clubgoers enters the bar. An attractive young woman makes here way somewhat uneasily over to them. "Are you English?" she drawls at Freddie with Southern accent.<br/><br/>"No, I'm German."<br/><br/>"You're cute."<br/><br/>"I learned my English in England, that's why I have an English accent."<br/><br/>"Wait, the rest of you are Americans, right? You should come down with us to the Blue Pyramid. Everybody's going. It's the thing to do."<br/><br/>"Ah, the new singer."<br/><br/>"I guess so. Oh, here's my husband."<br/><br/>"Hello. My name's Scott. I see you've met Zelda."<br/><br/>"Scott what?" asks Freddie.<br/><br/>"Fitzgerald, old boy. Say, you look familiar. Were you at any of those parties on Long Island about three years ago?"<br/><br/>"I showed up from time to time."<br/><br/>"I thought so. I liked those parties--put them in my new book. Just came out recently."<br/><br/>"Oh? What's it called?"<br/><br/>"Scotty wanted to call it <i>Trimalchio in West Egg</i>!" says Zelda.<br/><br/><i>[That was one of the actual working titles, and the one Fitzgerald liked the best. And how could I do Paris in the 20s without Scott and Zelda?]</i><br/><br/>"Well, what's wrong with that!"<br/><br/>"Exactly what I said!" says Scott. "That's why I wanted it to go back to that. They didn't listen to me. It's called <i>The Great Gatsby</i>."<br/><br/>They all head down to the Blue Pyramid. Scott and his friends have reserved a table. They arrive at the end of the intermission, just in time for Hypatia to take the stage. Freddie instantly recognizes her as Hypatia Masters, the same as he remembered her from Egypt, albeit with updated hair and wardrobe.<br/><br/>She sings in French, and English--quite charmingly. Then she begins to mingle with the audience, speaking with people at their tables. Everyone seems to be enjoying their conversations.<br/><br/>She reaches Freddie's table. She looks at each of them in turn.<br/><br/>"You can sleep in her bed," she says to Francis, "she doesn't care anymore."<br/><br/>She looks at Jimmy. "You had a nasty surprise today. You did the right thing."<br/><br/>Before Freddie can get a word in, she turns to him. "Hello, Freddie. We'll talk later.

"You're right," she says. "I should leave him."<br/><br/>Freddie notices that the people at other tables are crying, or stunned, or sometimes laughing. "Sheila, what did Hypatia say to you?"<br/><br/>"She didn't say anything."<br/><br/>"But you seemed to respond."<br/><br/>"Oh. Well, I was just thinking that I'm never going to get anywhere as long as I'm with you. I mean, you can give me vacations or money, but it's not going to help me make something of myself. And it's not like you love me or anything."<br/><br/>Freddie pauses, for once at a loss for words.<br/><br/>"What's the matter, Mr. Blakely?" says Mwimbe with a wicked grin. "Has the cat got your tongue?"<br/><br/>Freddie tries to say something. He starts, and then stops. "What a minute. Wait. Marriage?!!"<br/><br/>"I didn't say anything about marriage."<br/><br/>"You talked about love!"<br/><br/>"You're a man of the world. You know they don't have to have anything to do with each other."<br/><br/>"Indeed, which is why I like them to go hand in hand."<br/><br/>"You'll never marry anyone. Maybe you would have once. But she's dead."<br/><br/>An usher creeps up to O'Donnell. "Hypatia would like to see you."<br/><br/>"And I take it she does not like to be disappointed."<br/><br/>"Indeed not, sir."<br/><br/>"That's too bad for her, then."<br/><br/>"You are refusing? I will tell her. She will be unhappy."<br/><br/><br/>"What ho, Hypatia!"<br/><br/>Freddie comes into Hypatia's dressing room. Tewfik is finishing an angry conversation with her in Arabic, which of course Freddie no longer understands. The Egyptian storms past Blakely.<br/><br/>"What ho, Tewfik!"<br/><br/>"Do not make me have to kill you!"<br/><br/>Freddie shrugs and sinks into a chair.<br/><br/>"So what brings you to Paris?" asks Hypatia.<br/><br/>"The diary of course."<br/><br/>"Oh....Jax...whatever her name is. That's fine. So you're looking into Eddie."<br/><br/>"Oh. Yes. I'm sorry, I thought you meant to ask me about...that other fellow. The one you work for."<br/><br/>"I told you, I don't work for him. We're...colleagues."<br/><br/>"I don't think the Dark Lord has the same understanding of your relationship."<br/><br/>"I didn't say we were on the same level," sighs Hypatia. "We just both inhabit...the same dimensional <i>space</i>...it's complicated. Anyway, you just have to know how to operate with him. I'm living proof you can come to an accommodation."<br/><br/>"And do you think I could come to a similar accommodation, and start speaking Arabic again?"<br/><br/>"I don't think you have it in you, Freddie. Takes a certain...self-control. But once he's got his eye on you, you need to come up with something. Or stop doing whatever drew his attention. Anyway, what are you going to do about Gavigan."<br/><br/>"He seems rather fixated on you."<br/><br/>"Yeah, I really can't get my hands dirty on this one."<br/><br/>"Maybe you can help us out?"<br/><br/>"You should go and find out about him. Where he's from. What he's about. The source."<br/><br/>"You know, now that you're the owner here, can you tell me about what happened to those girls?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I put a stop to that. The ones that were already taken, well, they're someplace else. I won't tell you where because I really don't want you snooping around there. And frankly--this is a freebie, no strings attached--you really don't want to be there either. Now, I have another show to do. So long, Freddie."<br/><br/>"One last thing. I saw your portrait today on a 4th Dynasty sculpture."<br/><br/>"That old thing! My goodness, they dug that up?"<br/><br/>"Indeed. Who's Vanessa?"<br/><br/>"Now Freddie, that would be telling."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy finds himself drinking next to a shabby, depressed looking man who is drinking absinthe.<br/><br/>"You look like you had a bad day."<br/><br/>"I was blocked."<br/><br/>"Huh?"<br/><br/>"Blocked. I am a painter. I had a block today, and I couldn't get out of my head. So I am drinking absinthe. Maybe it will help. They say this Hypatia could help as well."<br/><br/>"Look, everything happens for a reason."<br/><br/>"You know, you're right."<br/><br/>"What ho, Scotty!"<br/><br/>"Hi Freddie. This is my painter friend."<br/><br/>"What ho, painter friend!"<br/><br/>"Miles Shipley."<br/><br/>"Pleased."<br/><br/>"You know about art, right Freddie?" says Jimmy. "Maybe you can help him."<br/><br/>"Ah, be a patron of some kind?"<br/><br/>"I could use a patron," mutters Shipley. "Come up and see some paintings. Tomorrow. They need natural lighting."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ensemble--Freddie, Mwimbe, Sheila, Jimmy and Francis--tumble out and pack into Francis' car. He drops them off at their new hotel and then starts driving back to Montmartre.<br/><br/>As he crosses the Pont Neuf, he sees a man standing on the railing. As he brakes the car, the man leaps into the Seine.<br/><br/>Francis stops the car and leaps over the railing and dives into the river. The man is not struggling at all as Francis catches up to him.<br/><br/>It's Guy Forgeron. "No. Let me go," he screams.<br/><br/>Francis starts to pull him towards side of the river, but the current drags them under the bridge. "No, we must all die," raves Guy.<br/><br/>Francis cold cocks him to keep him from preventing them from reaching the river. He drags Guy up onto the esplanade and coughs up riverwater.<br/><br/>With some difficulty he drags Guy back up to his car. A policeman is writing him a ticket. "Monsieur, monsieur," says Francis.<br/><br/>"Hey, you can't park on the bridge. It's a thousand years old! You can't use it as a parking lot."<br/><br/>"Good Samaritan," says Francis, flopping Guy into his car.<br/><br/><i>[Cop Talk use by OP.]</i><br/><br/>The policeman shakes his head. "If I've seen it once, I've seen it fifty times."<br/><br/>"I know this guy. I'm going to take him to his wife."<br/><br/>"Oops," says the cop, ripping up the ticket. "I guess it blew off. Have a good night, man."<br/><br/>Francis drops Guy off at Marie's. "Why do you smell like the Seine? Was he out with you and some girls?"<br/><br/>"Can I wash up and change?"<br/><br/>Guy's daughters gather around their father. "Papa, papa!" they pipe.<br/><br/>Marie sighs. "You know I don't like you, Fran\xe7ois."<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"Guy used to be a different man before he met you!"<br/><br/>"He was drunker and fatter and even more of a womanizer!"<br/><br/>"But he was home on the weekends." She pushes Francis into the bathroom.<br/><br/>"Thanks."<br/><br/>"You're still coming to dinner on Sunday, right? It wouldn't be the same without you."<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's past midnight when Francis gets back to his apartment. He pulls up a chair in the bedroom and takes out his lighter, a heavy silver Ronson lighter. One side is engraved, "Isabelle \xe0 Fran\xe7ois." He stares at the lighter for a long time, and the bed that he hasn't slept in since his wife died in it.<br/><br/>The sky is getting light when he finally tumbles onto his couch and falls asleep.<br/><br/><i>[Francis' Symbol is the lighter, a gift from his deceased wife.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421997/#Comment_421997" name="Item_294" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T21:14:51+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  9:14PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did Freddie propose to Sheila, or did I figure he implied something he didn't?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422022/#Comment_422022" name="Item_295" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T08:11:39+00:00" title="September 26, 2013  8:11AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He does at the start of Episode VIII, so you picked it up correctly.<br/><br/>Bit odd for FP to take it that direction, I thought--but maybe he was desperate to fix his source of stability to him?

"Doctor, as I recall we did bring you along on this Fellowship to...Egypt. I wanted to know if you wished to return to Egypt to continue your work."<br/><br/>"Given the manner of our departure from Egypt, that may be rather difficult. If you wish to discontinue our partnership, I will of course go wherever it is necessary to go."<br/><br/>"I think you misunderstand. I have no desire to end our partnership, it's just that the Fellowship I gave you--"<br/><br/>"I understood that to be a thinly veiled excuse to bring me along. Am I incorrect in assuming that Miss Jackson visited Zanzibar? I could of course be quite useful there."<br/><br/>"What do you think about Ireland this time of year?"<br/><br/>"It is spring, so it is raining."<br/><br/><br/><i>Wednesday, 13 May 1925</i><br/><br/>Jimmy, Freddie and Francis meet for breakfast in Montmartre. Jimmy, drugged out on opiates for his hands, rather slurringly relates the story of his adventure at the Penhew Fondation. Francis scoffs at the ideas of monsters. Freddie decides that the books belong in the Modern Charleston Library and promises to put them in his safe at the hotel.<br/><br/>The address Shipley gave them is a rather run-down boarding house in Montmatre. An elderly French lady greets them. "Are you here to buy a painting?"<br/><br/>"I'm here to patronize him, yes."<br/><br/>"He is always working. He is very industrious. Come in. I am Madame Lafarge. He is upstairs."<br/><br/>They climb to the garret of the building. Miles Shipley is hunched over a canvas. He starts with a cry as they come in.<br/><br/>"Wait!" he barks at Jimmy. "You. Stand over there. Hold your arm--so. Yes...yes...that's it."<br/><br/>Freddie cranes his head at the canvas. Shipley is painting nothing that looks like Jimmy--rather, he is doing a disturbingly realistic, if that's the right word for it, portrait of a being that looks like a cross between a human and a snake.<br/><br/>"It's very abstract--"<br/><br/>"It's not Abstract!" shouts Shipley.<br/><br/>"Snake snake snakesnakesnake..." chatters Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Snake snake snake snake," sneers Shipley back. "My paintings speak truth. I paint reality, Monsieur," he says to Freddie.<br/><br/>Jimmy looks around at some of the paintings on the wall. One catches his eye--a huge winged flying snake. Francis recognizes it as something Jax wrote about in her diary--supposedly, such a creature attacked her ship on the way back from France.<br/><br/>Freddie recognizes the creature that destroyed his apartment in New York, and nearly killed them all in the Egyptian desert.<br/><br/>This painting is also disturbingly realistic.<br/><br/>"Miles," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"What! I mean, yes monsieur."<br/><br/>"No, you can say what."<br/><br/>"Okay what?"<br/><br/>"I've run into one of those before."<br/><br/>"No you haven't."<br/><br/>"I didn't say I defeated it, just that I saw one."<br/><br/>"Oh. In that case, yeah."<br/><br/>"You've met them?"<br/><br/>"I've...<i>seen</i> them."<br/><br/>"Where do you see these things?"<br/><br/>"I uh...why...in my imagination. I don't feel so good. Would you excuse me?" He stomps down the stairs, followed by Francis and Freddie. "Madame!" screams Miles. "I need my medicine!"<br/><br/>Jimmy stays in the garret, taking pictures. He finds a closet, locked with a padlock. But not in any serious way.<br/><br/>Entering the closet, he finds an easel. A painting, covered with a canvas dropcloth, stands in the middle.<br/><br/>Stroking his lucky rabbit's foot, Jimmy pulls off the cloth.<br/><br/>The painting is the most realistic of Shipley's work yet--beyond photorealism, if that were possible. The composition, however, is disappointing. A small island, surrounded by trees, in a swampy morass, with a stone altar on it.<br/><br/>Jimmy peers closer, hoping to find a clue.<br/><br/><i>[JP: Can I look closer?<br/>Me: ...yes, if you give me a Stability check.<br/>JP: Uh, for how much?<br/>Me:...just a Stability check. Because I'm going to make one too...<br/><br/>In case you don't know ToC rules, this is a contest--a series of rolls, the first to lose loses the contest. I had an "inertia pool" for the painting, and JP had Jimmy's Stability pool.]</i><br/><br/>As he watches, the water...seems to start to move, as if it was a slow, swampy current. Marveling at the optical illusion, Jimmy is entranced.<br/><br/>The clouds seem to begin to move. The branches of the trees seem to move, blowing in a gentle breeze.<br/><br/><i>[FP: Allow me to quote the words of Admiral Akbar: "It's a trap"<br/>OP: It's a tarp!<br/><br/>I charged JP one last Stability check to tear himself away; had he failed, into the past he would go. JP decided to take a huge risk and only spend one point on the roll--Jimmy was down to 2 points of Stability, and didn't want to go to 0. Had Jimmy gone negative, of course, that would have been a Mythos shock and loss of Sanity.]</i><br/> <br/>With a great effort of will, Jimmy yanks the cloth back over the painting. His mind reels, and he has a hard time separating reality from whatever was in the painting. He cowers in a corner and rocks in a fetal position.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422061/#Comment_422061" name="Item_297" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T20:07:16+00:00" title="September 26, 2013  8:07PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: Mais la vie s\xe9pare ceux qui s'aiment (Part 9)</b><br/><br/>"Oh my poor boy," says Madame Lefarge, taking Miles into the basement.<br/><br/>Freddie looks out into the narrow courtyard. He notices it is blind--there are no windows opening on it.<br/><br/>For some reason, there is a large boulder in the courtyard. He looks at the ground around the boulder and finds some strange footprints. He studies them closely.<br/><br/>The prints are not human. They look like...some kind of lizard.<br/><br/>When he finds the track of a long tail, his mind reels temporarily.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen, please. Do not stand in this vile courtyard. Please. Come take some tea."<br/><br/>Freddie tries to busybody his way into the kitchen. "I like to make herbal teas," chatters the goodwife. Something not quite honest about the woman is bothering him.<br/><br/>Francis ambles around the rather dingy sitting room, hands in his pockets. He glances up. <br/><br/>It's nothing, he tells himself. A trick of the light. That the old woman's shadow <i>doesn't look human</i>.<br/><br/>Francis catches Freddie's eye and jerks his thumb towards the door. Then he heads upstairs to gather Jimmy.<br/><br/>Shipley comes back upstairs, pupils dilated. "Wanna buy a painting? Everybody should buy painting."<br/><br/> One of his eyes begins to rotate independently of the other. "Freddie Blakely," he mutters. "Oh. Wow. I thought I'd never meet...wow."<br/><br/>"I never introduced myself, did I?"<br/><br/>"You don't have to. I have some really special paintings down in the basement. You should buy them."<br/><br/>"Blakely," says Francis, coming downstairs, dragging Jimmy, "We're going." He yanks on the door handle.<br/><br/>The door is locked. From the inside.<br/><br/>"Why don't you all have some tea?" says Madame Lefarge.<br/><br/>Freddie pours his cup out. "I seem to have spilled it."<br/><br/>"Don't look at the paintings don't look at the paintings don't look at the paintings..." mutters Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Madame Lefarge, you are going to open this door now, or things will get unpleasant," says Francis.<br/><br/>"No, I won't be opening the door," says the delicate old Frenchwoman with resignation. "I would prefer not to let you go. After all, it's almost lunchtime."<br/><br/>She lunges at Francis, morphing as she does from a human being in an unfashionable dress to a large, humanoid lizard. Fangs sink deeply into Francis' shoulder.<br/><br/>Jimmy, crying, collapses to the ground, sweeping the legs of the former Madame Lefarge out from under her.<br/><br/>Francis grabs his gun in its shoulder holster. Not bothering to draw, he swivels it at the creature's head and fires.<br/><br/>Hissing, the lizard...thing pops up on all fours and bites Francis in the leg. He screams in agony. The room goes red for a second as blood spurts from the wound. <br/><br/>Freddie sweeps up the tea kettle and smacks the lizard-lady over the head. Hot tea spurts all around the room.<br/><br/>Francis pulls his gun free and fires another point-blank round into the creature. It shrieks and collapses, ichor welling up from the wounds.<br/><br/>Francis continues to fire until the clip is empty. He collapses next to Jimmy.<br/><br/>Freddie tests the door after he tends Francis' wounds. The door remains resolutely locked. Jimmy continues to babble.<br/><br/>"Shipley old boy, do you think you could open the door?"<br/><br/>"Is momma dead?"<br/><br/>"She won't be serving tea."<br/><br/>"Did momma lock the door? She's the only one who could open it. I need my medicine. It's in the basement, where momma keeps her food."<br/><br/>Francis cold cocks Shipley to shut him up.<br/><br/>Freddie goes downstairs. There is junk...mystic symbols on the wall...a bookcase full of grimoires not written in any human language...and a deep stone tub with a lid.<br/><br/>Freddie decides against opening the tub.<br/><br/>Eventually they make their way back up to the garret. A skylight is the only exit they can find in the house that they can fit through. They crawl across the roof to the next building and make their way down its stairs.<br/><br/>As they reach the car, Francis suddenly collapses. He feels as if his shoulder and leg are on fire. He screams in agony all the way to the hospital, where after several desperate attempts, doctors find the right mix of antivenins to treat him.<br/><br/><i>[Serpent-person venom is nasty stuff; had OP failed his Health check, he would have been in respiratory failure.<br/><br/>Ssathasaa is very tough, but she didn't expect for her prey to have a gun--she thought they were just some more buyers. Without the gun being fired at point-blank range, she probably would have knocked out Francis (one more attack would have done it) and then mopped up on Freddie and Jimmy.<br/><br/>That was the end of the session. I really enjoyed the energy OP and JP brought, and the Jimmy-Francis dynamic was fun for us all.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422071/#Comment_422071" name="Item_298" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T02:41:56+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  2:41AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very exciting!

Nobody else had any weapons better than fists, and I probably would have asked for a Stability test if Francis had gone down. They would have had a chance--they did outnumber Ssathasaa, after all--but not a great one.<br/><br/>I used Marvel Heroic Roleplaying initiative for the fight. OP caught on very quickly the implications of having the opposition go last, and wisely elected to have Ssathasaa go right after he did, letting Freddie finish the round and have Francis go next. Without doing that, they probably would have been--well, not killed, but I'd have extracted something horrible from them, to be sure, and probably would have offed one of the PCs.<br/><br/>I listened to the recording of Episode IX today, the one that's just Jimmy and Francis. Somehow I managed to make an actual noir out of it. Obviously, the characters in question helped, but I had a bunch of good noir elements to work with. I read somewhere that the main characteristic of a noir is a hero who gets caught in a situation--he tries to make it better, and that just causes it to continue to spiral out of control. That certainly seemed to be the case in Lesser Edale (now much lesser, since a large chunk of the town got eaten by werewolves.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Les pas des amants d\xe9sunis (Part 1)</b><br/><br/><i>[We still didn't get to full strength this session--OP was away, and CP (whose job has been stressful of late) was delayed. We did welcome back GP, who always brings a nice laid-back style to the session.<br/><br/>Before the game, I gave each player <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOVmx2RVYxek1wdXc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">these Apocalypse World-style handouts</a>, and asked them to make some choices. Most of them took all the options. I tried not to cackle.]</i><br/><br/> <i>Thursday, 14 May 1925</i><br/><br/>In the morning, Freddie goes out to a jewelers and picks up two wedding rings. He invites Sheila into his suite at their three-star tourist hotel.<br/><br/>He hands her a plain box containing the rings. "Sheila old girl, I know that I'm not exactly what you'd call an amazing catch. I have enormous amounts of family issues, mostly with the aunts, and I seem likely to be in trouble from now until the end of my potentially quite short life. However, you're the most important person in my life, even more important than Bertie, who keeps me out of all sorts of trouble."<br/><br/>"Oui," says Gilbert from the corner, where he is smoking.<br/><br/><i>[There's a running gag about Gilbert always being around Freddie even in his most intimate moments.]</i><br/><br/>"So I thought I should give these to you," continues Freddie, "and you can let me know if you ever have the dashed insane idea of you wearing one of these and me wearing the other."<br/><br/>"I...I have to think about this," says Sheila, stunned.<br/><br/>"L'amour," sighs Gilbert, with a shrug.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Come in, officers," says Freddie to the man in the neat but threadbare suit accompanied by two policemen.<br/><br/>"Bon jour. I am Inspecteur Jacques Melville, of the S\xfbret\xe9. You are Mr. Freddie Blakely, late of England."<br/><br/><i>[In the main </i>Masks<i> text, there's a character named James Barrington. I tried to come up with a suitably banal French last name before giving up and naming him after one of my favorite French directors. To be fair, he named himself after the American writer.]</i><br/><br/>"I am German now. Republican, not one of those Second Reich types."<br/><br/>"It is strange, but you have come up in two of my investigations. I am in charge of the cases of the Arab girls who vanish from the Quartier Latin. And this morning a body was found in Montmartre, and witnesses gave your description as having been in the area."<br/><br/>Freddie explains that he had been to see Hypatia--an old friend from New York--and met this painter Shipley and visited him. He discovered that the painter was crazy, so he didn't buy a painting. He doesn't know anything about the body of course. <br/><br/>Melville mentions that his wife is insisting they go to see Hypatia's show that night. He also mentions that Shipley has been put into a mental hospital. They also found parts of bodies in the basement.<br/><br/>"Ah, I see," sighs Melville. "As they say down at the department, <i>si c'est un travail plein de merede, c'est un travail pour Melville.</i>. I will be frank with you. This is not the first unusual occurrence I have come across in Paris. I believe that there is a cult in operation here. <i>Le culte de la fraternit\xe9 noire.</i>"<br/><br/>Melville explains that Shipley's paintings show images that also occur in other sources--occult sources. He believes that he drew his inspiration from information provided by the cult. He also says that Le Pyramide Bleu has been a hotbed of cult activity--at least until l'Am\xe9ricaine bought it.<br/><br/>"Do you know a man named Tewfik al-Sayed?"<br/><br/>"Very rude man."<br/><br/>"I think he is associated with the cult."<br/><br/>"Well, I wish you the best of luck with that..."<br/><br/>"Please, sir. I do not think it is an accident that an associate of Jackson Elias should have come to Paris at this time."<br/><br/>"Damnit, Jax, still getting me in trouble!"<br/><br/>"I met her. Her death was mysterious, but her accusations troubled me. She claimed that there was complicity at the very highest rungs of society. And I must tell you, monsieur, that my investigations have been blocked, as if powerful people were stopping them."<br/><br/>Freddie, through some rather roundabout phrasing, manages to implicate Gavigan. Melville is surprised and a bit suspicious, given their recent history.<br/><br/>They part with a warning from Freddie not to go to Hypatia's show. Melville asks Freddie if he could perhaps drop by Tewfik's store, hoping that somebody not tied to his investigation might have more luck.<br/><br/>As he leaves, Melville shoots Gilbert a dirty look. "Hey you effing Red, don't think you're fooling anybody," he says in quick gutter French. But he flashes one of the handsigns Gilbert used during the days of the Paris Soviet.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422148/#Comment_422148" name="Item_302" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-28T08:49:58+00:00" title="September 28, 2013  8:49AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fixed the link above so I shouldn't need to approve you if you want to look at it!

Been forever since updates! I apologize. The last couple of weeks, and especially this last week, have been pretty nuts for me. <br/><br/>Our next session is scheduled for this coming Saturday, which will once again be without FP. This is a blow, but on the other hand an excellent opportunity to bring out the play of the other players.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie gathers Jimmy, and Alphonse and they head down to the spice shop of Tewfik al-Syed. They drop by Mahoney's first to find out about Jacques Melville. Mahoney tells them that Melville had served as an officer with troops stationed near Verdun during the height of the German offensive in 1916. When he got rotated out to the northern part of the front, he defended several of his soldiers who were involved in the massive mutinies of late 1917. This killed his law career and has stalled out his career in the S\xfbret\xe9.<br/><br/>"He's honest enough, for a cop," sums up Mahoney.<br/><br/>Alphonse also asks about his brother Anton, who hasn't turned up for a few weeks. Mahoney offers to send out some "reporters" to look for him. He also tells Freddie that if he needs a plane to go to Ireland, to go to Orly airfield and ask for a pilot named JS.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The store of Tewfik al-Syed proves to be a bustling spice emporium in the Latin Quarter, near the Rue Monge and the Paris mosque. Elegant couples and the servants of the well-to-do browse the racks and loudly haggle over the wares. Freddie introduces himself to a man at the counter, and after a brief wait Tewfik descends the stairs from his private apartment. As usual he is beautifully turned out and wearing a fez.<br/><br/>"Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>Freddie explains that he has been sent by Hypatia to talk to him. Tewfik becomes upset at the mention of her name, calling her a vile name in Arabic.<br/><br/>"She took my club from me, and now I am not even welcome in it!" he spits.<br/><br/>Freddie tries to reassure Tewfik, indicating that perhaps he could help maneuver against Hypatia, mentioning in passing that he met her in Arabia after leaving Egypt. Tewfik is interested in this last fact. "You perhaps met a mentor of mine, Omar Shakhti-Bey?"<br/><br/>"We had a rather pleasant conversation."<br/><br/>"The Bey informed me of your activities."<br/><br/>"Our relationship was sometimes antagonistic, but sometimes friendly."<br/><br/>"That was not his impression."<br/><br/>"Well, I can tell you he was no friend of Hypatia's."<br/><br/>"And I will tell you, Shakhti-Bey will have his revenge."<br/><br/><i>[At this point, Tewfik's plan is to use the upcoming Big Ceremony to try and resurrect Shakhti.]</i><br/><br/>"Oh is he still alive?"<br/><br/>"Is Shakhti dead?"<br/><br/>"It certainly looked as if Hypatia killed him."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy notices that one of the Arab-looking fellows in the front of the store is one of the same ones that have been watching his hotel. He points this out to Gilbert.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble roll by JP]</i><br/><br/>Gilbert surreptitiously trips a woman into a table display, bumping into another woman. They begin to argue in French, and are soon joined by their husbands. The clerks try and sort this out, and Tewfik leaves Freddie to clean up the problem.<br/><br/>Freddie slips upstairs while nobody is watching.<br/><br/>The Arab that Jimmy recognized slips out of the front door during the commotion. Jimmy takes off in pursuit.<br/><br/><i>[We almost broke out the Piggybacking rules here, but GP decided to have Alphonse stay. As this was following his Drive, I gave him a Stability point.]</i><br/><br/>Upstairs, Freddie finds a room furnished in the Turkish style, with lots of wall hangings. A rolltop desk is in one corner, and in another corner is a large, ornate mirror.<br/><br/>Downstairs, Tewfik has managed to placate everyone. He heads for the staircase. Alphonse give a polite cough to alert Freddie, who sneaks into the bedroom, slides open a window, and climbs down the side of the building--landing on top of a garbage can.<br/><br/><i>[I wanted to just charge FP a point of Stealth; but he was all out. Tant pis.]</i><br/><br/>Someone shouts in Arabic from upstairs. Two rather large clerks immediately run out the back door and into the alleyway, followed by Alphonse.<br/><br/>Freddie dashes out into the busy street, but the two thugs stay hot on his trail, followed in turn by Gilbert. <br/><br/>As Freddie slips out into the street, he darts a look back at his two pursuers. And thus he doesn't see the cabriolet bearing down on him. At the last second he notices the oncoming carriage and leaps up onto the traces.<br/><br/><i>[FP used a narrative scene to refresh some Fleeing, which is a rule I took from NBA.]</i><br/><br/>"Two hundred francs if you go as fast as you can where you were headed!"<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance buy by FP.]</i><br/><br/>"Tour Eiffel, bien s\xfbr!" says the driver. He begins to turn the carriage. A car nearly hits him, but when it slams on the brakes traffic immediately backs up behind it. The carriage is rapidly caught in a sea of metal and screaming Parisians.<br/><br/><i>[I actually failed the driver's roll.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie climbs up into the carriage and plops down next to its occupants, which turn out to be a very surprised Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. "What ho, Scott! What ho, Zelda!"<br/><br/>The two thugs reach the carriage. One grabs the reins, while the other starts pulling at Freddie's sleeve. A policeman starts running over to the carriage.<br/><br/>Gilbert pauses for a second. On the one hand, his boss is in serious trouble. On the other, if he is nabbed by <i>les flics</i>, well, Madame Guillotine is always open for business, especially for traitors.<br/><br/><i>[This was a soft driver for GP]</i><br/><br/>Gilbert screams and runs straight into the man holding the reins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422853/#Comment_422853" name="Item_305" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T19:54:40+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  7:54PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2013 1:30PM by Aviatrix.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VIII: Les pas des amants d\xe9sunis (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy soon loses his tail in the crowds, but figuring that he would head towards the Mosque, he starts asking around the street vendors in the area around it. The Arab and Egyptian salespeople have little to say to him, but he finds some Americans painting street scenes. <br/><br/>"This guy?" one says, holding up a sketch of the man Jimmy was following. "He's one of a bunch of guys who look like they're heading towards the mosque but they never go in. They hang out in a caf\xe9 nearby. I was in the war, you know, but those guys look tough in the 'crazy in the head' way."<br/><br/>Just then Jimmy notices a car prowling near the square, filled with some mean looking Egyptians. They seem to be searching for someone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gilbert throws the thug from Tewfik's store to the ground. He cracks his head on the pavement and passes out. The carriage driver whips his horse and pulls away from the traffic jam. The remaining thug tries to pursue, but soon gets trapped in the crowd.<br/><br/>The policeman headed towards the carriage stops to untangle the traffic jam...until he notices the man passed out in the gutter. He blows on his whistle as several people point at a skulking Gilbert.<br/><br/><i>[GP blew his Stealth roll.]</i><br/><br/>Gilbert starts to run, with the cop hot on his trail. He cuts around a corner out into the boulevard, looking desperately for a M\xe9tro station.<br/><br/><br/>Scott, Zelda and Freddie head to Le Polidor in the 6th. There they meet their friend, Ernest Hemingway.<br/><br/>"When I was in Spain," he tells Freddie, "I saw things that were true. Simple and true. And they were true because they were violent."<br/><br/>"Well, I have noticed that violent things bring out truth..."<br/><br/>"Have you met Gertrude? We're having a little soir\xe9e tonight at her place."<br/><br/>"Does this mean you're inviting me?"<br/><br/>"I wouldn't have told you otherwise."<br/><br/><i>[Just want to mention that Le Polidor is one of my favorite stops in Paris. And it's probably not that much different than when Hemingway ate there.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy huddles up with the American painters. "What's the fastest way out of here?" asks Jimmy. They tell him the M\xe9tro is about ten minutes away, and he begins to run in the direction they gave him.<br/><br/><i>[What's your Drive? I said...]</i><br/><br/>As Jimmy runs past the car, it promptly does a three-point turn and begins to follow him.<br/><br/><br/>Alphonse races to a corner. A car is parked there, and the driver has just finished starting it. Gilbert jumps in and shoves the man--who is quite dapper in his boater and jacket--into the passenger seat.<br/><br/>"Monsieur!"<br/><br/>"Don't worry. I'm a cop." Gilbert punches the accelerator and drives off into traffic. As he pulls away from the curb, he sees the cop on a police phone, calling for backup.<br/><br/>After several agonizing minutes, Gilbert jumps out of the car near Place S. Michel. As he nears the entrance to the M\xe9tro, he notices two men in good suits following him. He curses the fact that he did not bring his gun with him.<br/><br/><i>[Failed Preparedness roll by GP.]</i><br/><br/>With nothing else to do, he stops and smokes a cigarette and lets the men come up to him.<br/><br/>"Excuse me, sir," one says in British-accented English. "We'd like to have a word with you. Not here, sir."<br/><br/>"I'd like to, but I have some responsibilities..."<br/><br/>"So do we, sir. Our responsibility is bringing you to our place."<br/><br/>"Could I see some identification?"<br/><br/>"No sir, I'm afraid you could not."<br/><br/>Gilbert shrugs and sets off with the two men.<br/><br/><br/>Jimmy manages to slip his pursuers. He rides the M\xe9tro aimlessly for a while, and then heads back to Freddie's hotel. He stops to pick up some flowers on the way.<br/><br/>When he gets up to Freddie's suite, he doesn't find anyone; Charleston and his girl are locked in their room as usual. <br/><br/>Sheila, though, is conspicuously absent. Looking around, Jimmy finds a note on the table:<br/><br/><i>Dear Freddie:<br/><br/>I have decided to return to America. I am leaving on the train for Normandy tonight. I will then be in London for the next two weeks until I depart for New York.<br/><br/>Very best,<br/><br/>Sheila Brisbane</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423083/#Comment_423083" name="Item_306" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-17T19:16:28+00:00" title="October 17, 2013  7:16PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2013 6:55PM by Aviatrix.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VIII: Les pas des amants d\xe9sunis (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>"Are you a [sexuality slur]?" demands Zelda of Freddie as they arrive at Gertrude Stein's apartment.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure what you mean."<br/><br/>"I mean that I'm sick and tired of Scott and his little boyfriend--"<br/><br/>"Ah! Gentlemen friends! No, not one of those."<br/><br/>The party is in full tilt. Freddie avoids the corner where Gertrude holds court and stands near the kitchen. A rather sour-faced woman comes in and out of it, fetching drinks. <br/><br/>"Hello, my name is Freddie, although some people call me 'BLAKELY!!'" he says to her.<br/><br/>"I'm Alice. Alice Toklas."<br/><br/>A smallish man with intense eyes walks by and says something in Spanish to Alice.<br/><br/>"You can only say <i>puta</i> so many ways, Pablo," she says calmly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy heads to Gare du Nord. He spends most of the night trying to talk to people. Finally he finds Thomas, a taxi dispatcher, who makes some calls. "Okay, yes, a cab was called for the hotel, it was to go to Gare du Nord, but it did not get here. The driver said that they changed their mind and asked to be dropped off at the Place S. Michel M\xe9tro station."<br/><br/>"They?"<br/><br/>"Yes, a woman and some men."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gilbert is taken to the outskirts of Paris, tied up, and thrown into a large closet. His brother Anton is also in the room, tied up.<br/><br/>"Hey brother."<br/><br/>"You know why we're here?"<br/><br/>"No. They picked me up, asked me where you were. I told them you ran off and you owed me a thousand francs anyway."<br/><br/>Eventually Gilbert is taken into a sitting room. A man in an elegant suit is behind a desk. "Mr. Alphonse Gilbert," he says. "Or should I say the first president of the Paris Soviet?"<br/><br/>"It's really more of an advisory position."<br/><br/>"The French call it treason. I don't think you want us to return you to their graces."<br/><br/>"Who are you?"<br/><br/>"Who I am is of no importance. Suffice to say that certain interests of mine have certain interest in Mr. Blakely. We have tried to catch him, but he has proved quite slippery. But you are on the inside. And one of the few people he trusts. Mr. Blakely doesn't care much for his family, because they treat him like an employee; he therefore treats his employees as family."<br/><br/><i>[I wanted to set this up to hit GP's Drive very hard. Betraying Freddie was a Hard Driver.]</i><br/><br/>"There's no way I'm going to do any of that."<br/><br/>"Very well. It's not as if Anton needs <i>both</i> thumbs."<br/><br/>"Wait. I can come up with a better plan to catch him."<br/><br/>"Please do. And act as if your life depends on it. Because it does."<br/><br/>"All right. Just knock on his door. He'll come with you if you ask nicely."<br/><br/>"No time like the present, then."<br/><br/><br/><i>Friday, 15 May 1925</i><br/><br/><br/>Near dawn Freddie stumbles home to an empty hotel suite. He goes to Mwimbe's room. Freddie asks her where Sheila is, but Mwimbe says that she does not know where Sheila is--and that anything else she knows was told to her in confidence. She suggests he go to the front desk.<br/><br/>The clerk tells him that Sheila left earlier in the day, with several large suitcases. She caught a cab and asked it to take them to Gare du Nord.<br/><br/>"What's Gare du Nord?"<br/><br/>"A train station."<br/><br/>Freddie gives him a hard look. "Is there anything else?"<br/><br/>"I...wouldn't know what you're talking about. I have nothing further I can say to you...I am a poor man, and I have a family..."<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble, then a Reassurance buy from FP.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy enters the lobby. "Scotty, old man," says Freddie "Sheila's--"<br/><br/>"--missing. I know."<br/><br/>"You're a remarkable private detective! Could you find my valet too?"<br/><br/>At that moment Gilbert walks in.<br/><br/>"My God, Scotty! You're amazing!"<br/><br/>"Could I have my briefcase?" says Gilbert. Freddie hands it to him, and Gilbert checks to make sure his sawed-off shotgun and pistol are inside. "We may have to kill some people."<br/><br/>Briefly Gilbert explains the situation, and they decide to go with the agents waiting outside, with Jimmy following behind them. They get in the car. Freddie is frisked, but Gilbert quietly slips his briefcase into the car under his coat.<br/><br/><i>[Conceal roll by GP. I'm slightly retrofitting this to have it make more sense than what we did in play; works out the same.]</i><br/><br/>They drive in circles, to disorient their prisoners. "This isn't necessary, you know," says Freddie. "I don't know Paris."<br/><br/>"With all due respect, sir, shut the eff up."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, behind them, Jimmy is in a hired cab. "Uh...suivez-vous ce voiture..."<br/><br/>"Follow that car, right."<br/><br/>Finally they arrive at an apartment building in the west part of Paris. They take Freddie and Gilbert back up to the third floor and toss Alphonse and his suitcase into the closet. Anton is smoking a cigarette with his feet.<br/><br/>Freddie is brought before the well-dressed man who tells him that he is to come with him to London, where he will be stripped of his citizenship and tried for treason, insurrection, and various other crimes against the Empire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423266/#Comment_423266" name="Item_307" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-21T19:47:54+00:00" title="October 21, 2013  7:47PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VIII: Les pas des amants d\xe9sunis (Part 5)</b><br/><br/><i>[We had Episode X this past weekend, with a bang-up conclusion to the Paris chapter including shantaks, apocalypse zombies, a plane crash in the Venice Lagoon, and Jimmy Wright: Big Damn Hero. But now let's try and catch further up on Episode VIII...]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy has the cab park outside. It looks like whoever is inside is using the entire building. The cabbie sits next to him in the front seat, reading Le Figaro. Jimmy can tell that the building is guarded, but his expertise doesn't help him much in figuring out where the guards are.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Inside, Freddie tries to drop M's name and gives his interlocutor a number to call. He sends out one of his underlings to call it. After a long pause, he returns and whispers in the interrogator's ear.<br/><br/>"Why did you have me call the British Museum?" he asks Freddie.<br/><br/><br/>In the storage closet, Gilbert asks Anton if he's found a way out.<br/><br/>"No, they started to beat me when I untied the ropes."<br/><br/>"Well, I could use some help..."<br/><br/><i>[GP was looking for a way to not use Athletics, so I let him spend Stability to prevail on his brother to help him out.]</i><br/><br/>In a short while, the brothers have freed each other. The door opens and a guard enters.<br/><br/>Gilbert punches him in the face, twists him around, and puts him in a headlock. The guard collapses unconscious. Anton helps drag him inside while Gilbert peeks into the main room.<br/><br/>Three other agents are standing around in it; a door to the right leads to the office where it seems Freddie is being held. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Outside, Jimmy comes to a resolution. He crawls over the cabbie and shoves him into the passenger seat, then pulls the car around and backs into the building as fast as possible.<br/><br/>Two men with guns drawn immediately come pelting across the street, firing.<br/><br/><br/>Freddie's interrogator springs up and runs into the sitting room, locking his office behind him. "One of you go down and check...where's Jackson?"<br/><br/>"He went in the closet," says one of the agents.<br/><br/>"Mr. Gilber," says the interrogator, "Are you in there?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"You had better come out." <br/><br/>"All right."<br/><br/>Gilbert pulls the hammers back on his sawed-off shotgun.<br/><br/><br/>Bullets shatter the windshield of Jimmy's cab. One clips his shoulder and he ducks out of the way of two other shots. The cabbie screams as a bullet catches him in the chest.<br/><br/>Jimmy jumps on the accelerator and runs over one of the agents. As he drives away, another agent comes out of the front of the building; he and the remaining agent fire their pistols, and this time he takes one in the chest.<br/><br/>Bleeding heavily, Jimmy manages to keep the car more or less on the road until he manages to reach a hospital.<br/><br/><br/>Back in the apartment, Gilbert and Freddie hear gunshots. Freddie starts fishing in his wallet for the handcuff keys he always keeps.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"I killed your friend," says Gilbert.<br/><br/>"And then we'll kill you."<br/><br/>"Did you know him well?"<br/><br/>"Yes, sir, very well--" says one of the agents.<br/><br/>Honing in on the sound of the man's voice, Gilbert fires his shotgun. It blasts a large hole in the door and a rather larger one in the agent.<br/><br/>The rest of the agents pour fire into the closet. The interrogator aims carefully and then shoots at Gilbert through the hole in the closet door, winging him.<br/><br/>"Take care of Blakely," he growls. The remaining agent tries to unlock the door, only to discover that Freddie has jammed it.<br/><br/>"Give it up, Gilbert!" says the interrogator. "You've outlived your usefulness!"<br/><br/>The agent dispatched to the first floor comes back up, toting a fire ax. He begins to chop at the door to the office. Freddie tosses some brandy through the rents in the door and follows it with a match. The burst of flame enrages the agent, who begins cursing and describing the punishments he plans to inflict on Freddie.<br/><br/>Gilbert glances at Anton, planning a desperate last assault.<br/><br/>"What the--" says the interrogator.<br/><br/>There is a choking sound.<br/><br/>Then the sound of four bodies hitting the floor.<br/><br/>The ax is stuck in the office door. Freddie pulls it through the door and looks into the sitting room.<br/><br/>All the agents are dead, with a look of twisted horror on their faces.<br/><br/>Freddie uses the ax to start cutting his way into the hallway.<br/><br/><br/>Eventually Gilbert and Anton work up the courage to leave the apartment. Freddie manages to chop his way through the office wall into the hallway, remarking that the odd bumps on his hands must be <i>blisters</i>.<br/><br/>They reach the wrecked front of the building. Across the street, dark figures dart in the shadows, keeping the building under observation.<br/><br/>Freddie sighs and picks up the phone in the front hallway. "M. l'Inspecteur Jacques Melville," he says.<br/><br/>Eventually Melville picks up. "What ho, Melville! I hope you didn't go see Hypatia last night."<br/><br/>"I did. My wife is very angry at me now."<br/><br/>"I have managed to find six dead British agents illegally in France. As a good German and ally of France, I thought you'd like to know."<br/><br/>"I find that extremely improbable. I suggest you call the S\xfbret\xe9."<br/><br/>"Well, I'm here in the 20th, and you're the only honest cop in Paris."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery spend by FP.]</i><br/><br/>"Oh," says Freddie, at Gilbert's urging, "there's these Arab fellows outside. Maybe associated with Tewfik..."<br/><br/>"I'll be right there," says Melville, hanging up.<br/><br/>Soon a police car and a paddy wagon pull up in front of the apartment. The furtive figures across the street melt away as Melville begins the agonizing process of debriefing Freddie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423269/#Comment_423269" name="Item_308" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-21T22:41:38+00:00" title="October 21, 2013 10:41PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, what's the state of Freddie's hands?

It's been a while since they got back from the desert, and there comes a point where the bandwidth necessary to constantly re-enforce the hand penalties was taking away from other players. I have been enforcing other things better, though; FP wanted to use Filch to hide something earlier in this session, but I (correctly) ruled that the skill was Conceal. You want to hide stuff, take Conceal, don't metagame the skill list.<br/><br/>As for the agents, they were associated with the ongoing metaplot about the private bill in Parliament. They were basically there to take Freddie back to England, and collateral damage wasn't something they worried about. Of course, they didn't expect to run into some PCs who would do stuff like crash a car into their building, or start a gunfight in a small room.<br/><br/>The cultists (specifically Tewfik's crew) took out the agents because they didn't want someone else to mess with the PCs; they were under orders to keep their eyes on them. Gavigan was feeling out who they were associated with, as they've now disrupted two major cult outposts.<br/><br/>Because (down the line) I've decided, in discussion with FP, to kill the citizenship metaplot (I don't want to force something on people if they're not having fun, and it was clear that FP wasn't going to ever really take it seriously enough to make it work as a plot element), we may never find out ingame who was behind it. I've dropped hints that it was someone very high up in the British system. Even without the metaplot, that person hasn't forgotten about Blakely, so there will be trouble coming from them in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423304/#Comment_423304" name="Item_310" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-22T20:27:39+00:00" title="October 22, 2013  8:27PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VIII: Les pas des amants d\xe9sunis (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>That evening Noor and Charleston are closeted in their room in Freddie's suite, hitting the books as usual. The room is deathly still, so still that Charleston can hear the creak of a footstep outside the door. At the same moment, he sees a figure scurry along the balcony outside the window.<br/><br/>"Noor," says Charleston. "You should go hide in the bathroom. Lock the door." He stands up and puts his back into a corner, watching the door and the window. Then he flicks off the lights.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, the door three rooms along--in Freddie's room--opens, along with the door in Charleston's room, at the same time the balcony doors in Freddie's and Charleston's rooms open.<br/><br/><i>[The suite was a long series of rooms--Charleston's at the bottom, a sitting room, and then Freddie's room]</i><br/><br/>Masked figures with clubs enter the room. Charleston grabs his camera and flashes the men nearest to him, who reel away blinded. Charleston charges forward and kicks one of the men coming in from the balcony. He stumbles backwards and falls over the railing, crashing six stories to the ground.<br/><br/>Three men dash in from Freddie's part of the suite and begin to scoop up books from the table, shoving them into sacks and then running for the door. Two others brandish clubs and charge at Charleston.<br/><br/>Charleston chants some words. His eyes glow red. One of the men with the book bags drops his sack and grabs the other book-laden intruder. They struggle toward the balcony, one bound to Charleston's will. One of the men with clubs sweeps some books into a bag, grabs the other two sacks of books, and rushes for the door.<br/><br/>The other intruder clubs Charleston. The two intruders struggling together tumble over the balcony and plunge to the courtyard below. The man with the sacks of books dashes into the hall.<br/><br/>Harold and Maude, tourists from America, are arriving below when Frenchmen start raining down on them. "It's one of those sex cults, Harold!"<br/><br/>"That's what we came here for!"<br/><br/>Charleston leaps off the balcony and grabs a rainpipe. He slides down it, pulling it out of the masonry as he does. Water begins to spray from ruptured plumbing. He lands in front of the lobby. "Concierge!"<br/><br/>"Sir? All you all right?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I have some scuff marks on my face."<br/><br/>"It's just that people usually take the stairs..."<br/><br/>"That suicide cult tried to through me off the balcony! Luckily your crappy building was able to slow my fall by collapsing."<br/><br/>"...suicide cult?"<br/><br/>"The one raining bodies down--and look, there's the leader!"<br/><br/>The man with the sacks of books enters the lobby. With his mask off, he looks like an everyday Frenchman.<br/><br/>"What are you talking about?" he says. "I'm here to make a delivery."<br/><br/>"I'll sign for it," says Charleston.<br/><br/>"It is not for you, monsieur. Now I must go and take this up with <i>mon chef</i>."<br/><br/>A large car pulls up in front of the lobby.<br/><br/>The man with books starts to dash for the car. Charleston kicks him the head and he drops to the floor. The car doors slam and two toughs come out and stand between it and the lobby doors.<br/><br/>At this point the two last intruders come into the lobby, dragging Noor with them. One has a knife to her throat.<br/><br/>"Give us the books or she dies," one grunts.<br/><br/>The concierge dives behind the desk. "Call some cops," says Charleston. "Preferably American ones."<br/><br/>A muffled "Screw you" can be heard from beneath the desk.<br/><br/>"How stereotypically French can you get?" says Charleston.<br/><br/>"Don't insult us by calling us French."<br/><br/>"Go to hell!" mutters the concierge.<br/><br/>"Look you guys are really tough. They spent six of you, right? Two of you are still alive. Why don't you drop those books and we can duel to the death?"<br/><br/>As if on cue, a man steps out of the car. He is wearing an elegant suit with a trenchcoat over it and a fez--Tewfik al-Syed.<br/><br/>"All right, Mr. Charleston. We have the girl. Hand over the books and we will give her to you, and maybe you will learn you cannot steal from us."<br/><br/>"I can't just do that. Why don't you take the books, and leave these guys for me to kill?"<br/><br/>A smile crosses Tewfik's face. Charleston turns to the two thugs. "Look, can't you see what's going on here? He'll let me kill you. Scram."<br/><br/><i>[Intimidation buy by CP.]</i><br/><br/>"Grab the books, Noor." She sweeps them up and dives behind the counter.<br/><br/>"Do you think I came unarmed to a magic fight?" growls Tewfik. "A duel of sorcerers. I have not had one in a long time."<br/><br/>"Do you want one?"<br/><br/>"You are an annoyance."<br/><br/>Charleston speaks the first few syllables of the Dread Name of Azathoth.<br/><br/>"I see you are truly an initiate," says Tewfik in Aklo.<br/><br/>"We both want knowledge," says Charleston in the same language. "Why be adversarial when we could share information."<br/><br/>"I think you are a dabbler, a little child who plays with his parents' tools. You have nothing to offer me."<br/><br/>"Well, I killed Shakhti, so I must know something..."<br/><br/>"The Master will return soon enough!" barks Tewfik, and blasts Charleston with a beam of black light.<br/><br/><i>[Shriveling spell. Old-School Sorcerer's Duel!]</i><br/><br/>Charleston screams in agony. Sirens can be heard from far away.<br/><br/>"I am going to take the books now," says Tewfik.<br/><br/>Charleston says a Word. Upstairs in his room, the pieces of his Thompson gun slide out of their hidden locations and begin to assemble themselves in midair. Then the gun plunges through the floor, and the five floors below it, until it sails into the lobby and lands in Charleston's hands.<br/><br/><i>[Occult, Cthulhu Mythos, and 5-point Preparedness spend by Charleston. And quoth the Keeper, what the hell.]</i><br/><br/>"Now wait a second," says Tewfik.<br/><br/>"Let me show you a trick I didn't learn from my books." <br/><br/>Charleston sprays out bullets. Tewfik drops, his gut perforated by .45 ACP slugs. Charleston plays the gun over the two toughs and then into the car until he exhausts the magazine.<br/><br/>Blood flows into the pools of water left by the spray from the broken plumbing. Charleston drops the gun, which launches back upstairs, disassembling itself as it does, and stands in the fall of water, trying to rinse off the blood. He is still standing there when the police arrive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423320/#Comment_423320" name="Item_311" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-23T18:28:24+00:00" title="October 23, 2013  6:28PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VIII: Les pas des amants d\xe9sunis (Part 7)</b><br/><br/><i>Saturday 16 May 1925</i><br/><br/>The next morning Freddie, Charleston and Gilbert head over to Tewfik's apartment. It is not locked in any way that Charleston finds to be an impediment.<br/><br/>When they come upstairs, they find three young women wearing not-quite-uniforms. Two are taking the mirror off of the wall while the other stands guard. Freddie recognizes her--it's Yalesha.<br/><br/>"Don't worry, we've got it in hand. You should probably leave," she says.<br/><br/>"We thought we'd come visit Hypatia."<br/><br/>"Yeah...not a good time, really. Let's get a move on, girls."<br/><br/>They ransack Tewfik's desk, and bring several artifacts back to Dr. Mwimbe.<br/><br/>While Jimmy recovers, they try several times to see Hypatia, but the club is sold out every time.<br/><br/><br/><i>Monday 25 May 1925</i><br/><br/><i>[This next bit technically took place in Session Nine; I did a flashback to catch Francis up. But it seems a better fit to go here.]</i><br/><br/><br/>Francis O'Donnell spends a few days in the hospital recovering from his snake bites, the last day or so accompanied by Jimmy, who arrives after a nasty car crash; apparently, car crashes cause bullet wounds. He putters around Montmartre for a few days working on his own cases. He hears about Sheila vanishing, but chalks it up to her discontent.<br/><br/>When he drops by the Forgeron's house for Sunday dinner, Guy's wife Marie is clearly upset. Ever since Guy threw himself into the Seine, he has been despondent, refusing to go out, refusing to do anything. <br/><br/>"The girls and I are frantic! Take him to Normandy, go fishing or something! Don't come back until he's better."<br/><br/>Guy is surprisingly not drunk. Francis notices his thousand yard stare and takes him to his place in Montmartre, where he force-feeds him a glass of wine. "Let's go to the burlesque tonight," says Francis.<br/><br/>"No. I don't want that."<br/><br/>"A nice restaurant?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. Okay."<br/><br/>Guy spends a day or two at Francis' apartment, not saying much, just sitting and smoking. Francis checks in a few times with Mickey Mahoney, who points out that nobody seems to be watching Gavigan. He makes a comment or two about the professionalism of Jimmy Wright.<br/><br/>Francis drops in on Inspecteur Jacques Melville. "I think the guy blocking your investigation is Edouard Gavigan."<br/><br/>"Are you insane? Besides, he's too rich."<br/><br/>Francis hands him some of the photographs Jimmy took. "This guy is up to no good. Just put some pressure on him."<br/><br/>"We can watch the place, I suppose."<br/><br/>Guy doesn't seem to get better no matter what Francis does. When he throws girls at him, Guy politely excuses himself. He'll refuse to drink at first, and then get far too drunk far too fast. Using his pharmaceutical skills, Francis acquires some uppers; these just make Guy distracted. Finally, Francis hypnotizes him, trying to give him the suggestion to be happier and nicer to his kids.<br/><br/>When Francis suggests that, Guy starts to cry.<br/><br/>Melville gets back to Francis after a few days. He tells Francis that Gavigan dropped by Tewfik's place the day after he got killed--he seems to have had a key. He left looking very disappointed. Melville also says that trucks occasionally drop by the Fondation Aubrey Penhew, heading to Cherbourg on the Atlantic coast.<br/><br/><i>Wednesday 27 May 1925</i><br/><br/>Francis sends some flowers to Hypatia, and she invites him to come down to the Club Hippolyte, as she has renamed the Blue Pyramid.<br/><br/>"Frankie, Frankie, Frankie," says Hypatia. "You sleeping in that bed yet?"<br/><br/>"I know Jimmy and the guys are getting in trouble. I'm worried about them."<br/><br/>"That crew was born for trouble. They decided to meddle in this."<br/><br/>"Anything you could give me about Gavigan?"<br/><br/>"Go to Ireland. Check out the castle he owns."<br/><br/>"Anything I could take to the police?"<br/><br/>"That's really not what you're here about, is it Francis? There are two stage doors. Go out of door A, and you're in Paris and everything is normal. Go out door B...and you get to see her one more time."<br/><br/>"I came here to help you. You want to play this kind of game? Forget you."<br/><br/>"You've got gumption. Dumb as a brick, but gumption. I like you."<br/><br/>"I just want to see that my cousin didn't die in vain, and that those of us trying to find out what happened...make it to the other side."<br/><br/>"Oh, that remains to be seen. You're meddling with powers you cannot comprehend. Well. There's a boat called the <i>Ivory Wind</i>. Check that out."<br/><br/><br/><i>Friday 28 May 1925</i><br/><br/>Francis takes Guy on a fishing trip to the Atlantic coast--near Cherbourg. Eventually Guy opens up a bit.<br/><br/>"What did Hypatia say to you, Francis? Because when she talked to me...I realized, all the women in my life, I have been <i>absolument merde</i> to them. Marie, she is nothing but good to me, and I play around on her. My girls are going to grow up with people like me...I couldn't stand it. I wanted to kill myself. I took a long look at who I am...and I hated it."<br/><br/>Francis slaps him. "You're a good man. We need you. People are dying."<br/><br/>"I know. I'm with you to the end, man.

"I think it's good that you're trying to be better."<br/><br/>"Yeah...I mean, I look at you and Isabelle, and you didn't have any time together, and I think I shouldn't be so horrible to...oh, I'm sorry Francis."<br/><br/>Francis looks away for a long time.

Francis remembers something and checks Jax's diary. According to it, while she was en route from Ireland to Halifax, Nova Scotia, she said a giant winged serpent came to her ship, searching for her. She escaped on a lifeboat and was picked up by a tramp steamer--the <i>Ivory Wind</i>. When she made landfall in Halifax and went to the steamer that was to take her to New York--hoping to somehow buy another ticket--the porter told her that she had already been by that morning to drop off her luggage.<br/><br/>Of course, Jax could have been pretty insane by then.<br/><br/>In the morning they find a port inspector who is willing, after a little encouragement, to take them on board the ship. The crew is mostly Chinese, and the ship has Shanghai registration; but the captain is Norwegian, a drunkard by the name Lars Torvak.<br/><br/>"We already did our customs inspection. Drink?" he says, taking a swig from his bottle.<br/><br/>"Just a formality. We're working with Interpol. Checking some cargo."<br/><br/><i>[Founded 1923, so contemporary.]</i><br/><br/>"We move antiquities, for charitable foundations. What do you need to see? Wait. I can't let you see that. You'd need a warrant."<br/><br/>"Well, I could come back with a warrant, and impound the ship, hold all your cargo, bring a unit of...oh, five guys..."<br/><br/>"Whoa, whoa! Okay, okay, here's the manifest, and my logs..."<br/><br/>The ship seems to bounce between Mombasa, Shanghai, Port Darwin (Australia?!), and Cherbourg. Right now they are bringing cargo from Australia to France, for transshipment...somewhere.<br/><br/>"We need to take a look at this," says Francis to the port inspector.<br/><br/>"We can't break the seals! That's really illegal...well...I guess I can go have a cigarette..."<br/><br/>Francis pops open a few crates. He finds several unusual trinkets that he can't place at all. Then he finds...highly machined parts, struts, and equipment that he has no clue about. All of it looks extremely new and very advanced.<br/><br/>"You're going to leave this here," says Francis to Torvak.<br/><br/>"I can't do that."<br/><br/>"How much is it?"<br/><br/>"It's not a question of money. They'll kill me. You may be a big scary guy from Interpol, but you don't frighten me. You think I'm this way because I'm a loser with a cargo ship? No. I was in the Navy. I only got like this after I started working for them."<br/><br/>Francis finds out that they are offloading the cargo tomorrow and then breaking port for Mombasa. He places a call to Jimmy in Paris, and despite having just left the hospital, he agrees to head up to see them that day.<br/><br/><i>Sunday 30 May 1925</i><br/><br/>"All right, Jimmy, here's the deal. We're going to sabotage that ship."<br/><br/>"An itty-bitty ship or..."<br/><br/>"No, a big cargo ship. We can either cause engine problems, or sink it."<br/><br/>Against his better judgment, Jimmy disguises himself as a longshoreman and sneaks aboard the ship. He makes his way down into the engine room. The Chinese engineer is snoring on a three-legged stool near the doorway.<br/><br/>Jimmy grabs a large wrench and quickly sabotages the oil feed to one of the engines. Then he starts it up. Within a few minutes the bearings are shrieking and an ugly smell of hot metal fills the room.<br/><br/>The engineer wakes up, looks at Jimmy, and then smacks him in the head with a wrench. Jimmy clocks the engineer on the head with <i>his</i> wrench. The two of them lock together for a moment, struggling for an angle, when Jimmy's leg gives out. He slams his head on a boiler and sits down heavily.<br/><br/>Outside, Francis and Guy see the crew begin to run for the hatches. Francis ducks behind his car and fires off a few shots at the ship. The remaining crew hit the deck.<br/><br/>Below decks, the engineer and one of his mates break out some rifles and head topside. Another engineer's mate stands guard over Jimmy, looking at him intently.<br/><br/>"Got any morphine?" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Ming says you tried to break the ship."<br/><br/>"No...I was trying to fix the ship..."<br/><br/>"Are you saying Ming hit you for no reason? Although that does sound like Ming. Five hundred francs."<br/><br/>"Five hundred francs?"<br/><br/>"To get you out of here."<br/><br/>The mate takes Jimmy on deck, sneaking behind cargo crates. They drop into a rowboat and the mate rows him to one of the other wharves.<br/><br/>The police arrive to see who fired the shots, but Francis has concealed the gun in its compartment beneath the car. Lacking direct evidence, they tell him to not leave town. Francis agrees calmly.<br/><br/>That afternoon they drive back to Paris.<br/><br/><i>Thursday 4 June 1925</i><br/><br/>At long last Freddie is able to get the group into Le Pyramide Bleu...er, Club Hippolyte, as it has been renamed. They arrive in the evening.<br/><br/>The decor of the club has changed, from faux-Egyptian to faux-Greek. The former belly dancers now wear fake armor. Almost naked men pretend to be slave boys as they bus the table.<br/><br/><i>[Right around this point I realized that Charleston had picked up a mental illness due to his stability shenanigans. See if you can figure out what it is!]</i><br/><br/>The posters for the club have changed--Hypatia is now drawn as Marianne, the personification of revolutionary France, complete with Phrygian cap. Freddie of course recognizes the significance of the club's name change--Hippolyta, the queen of the Amazons.<br/><br/>During Hypatia's show, Alphonse notices that while the women listening to her sing seem to be very interested and excited, the men seem to get much more depressed. He also notices that women vastly outnumber men in the audience.<br/><br/>Charleston notices that the sigils on the side of the proscenium seem to relate to mystical runes of mind control.<br/><br/>Hypatia drops by their table.<br/><br/>"I don't know you, Alfie. What do you want?"<br/><br/>"A cigarette."<br/><br/>"That's it? Gotta admire a man who knows what he wants. Chuckles! Nose in the book still, huh? How's your little girlfriend? And your kid?"<br/><br/>"Who cares."<br/><br/>"But thank you, by the way, for--our mutual friend. Aw, did Jimmy fall down go boom? Anyway, you guys should stay for the floorshow. I'll see you all after the show."<br/><br/>Hypatia begins to sing in French. Right about then, Freddie realizes...he can no longer understand French.<br/><br/><i>[Mythos shock, stability check, loss of Sanity.]</i><br/><br/>When the show ends and the crowd has left, Hypatia pulls up a chair next to their table. "<i>Oh, pauvre Freddie, comment \xe7a va?   \xcates-vous malade?</i>"<br/><br/>"You're delightful as usual."<br/><br/>"I had nothing to do with it, pal. All right, losers. You're worried about your girlfriend, Freddie? Mayhaps perhaps I could put you on the trail of her. Although you didn't take my advice before and go to Ireland."<br/><br/>"I had everything arranged, but then I got kidnapped..."<br/><br/>"Anyway. Go to Ireland. It doesn't do me anything directly, but I like you. Sure, maybe I have my own Dark Purposes, but they don't involve hurting you."<br/><br/>"That puts you apart from most of the sinister forces I know."<br/><br/>"Who describes their own motives as dark?" asks Charleston.<br/><br/>"Chuckles, don't you dare try and be noble with me."<br/><br/>"He's been that way ever since he separated from his child and her mother."<br/><br/>"Oh, right. That was sad. She was really cute, his daughter. Anyway. Going to Ireland will help you, and give you stuff on Eddie. If you don't, sooner or later he'll stop fencing with you and make a play you can't handle. Thought he'd throw Tewfik at you. Well, you handled that, and he's probably not crying in his wine about that."<br/><br/>"Can you tell me about Sheila?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. I can help you get her back. But if I do, she won't be yours anymore. She'll belong to me."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423738/#Comment_423738" name="Item_313" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-04T20:49:59+00:00" title="November  4, 2013  8:49PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IX: Je serai sur toi d\xe8s que le rayon de lune brillera (Part 1)</b><br/><br/><i>[Okay! continuing the tradition of mixing together Episode 8 &amp; 9, even though the next bit happened in Session 8, it logically belongs to the next episode--so we'll call it the beginning of Episode IX.<br/><br/>The song reference here is a bit obscure, mostly because the song in question is not originally in French. I make no guarantees about the quality of the translation, although it's not done by machine; I checked a couple of places to see how natives translated it.

At the slip Mickey told them to go to, they find a large Fokker Trimotor, easily capable of carrying their party to Ireland. Outside it stands a perfect stereotype of French aviation--a short man wearing a leather jacket, leather helmet on his head (with the goggles pushed up past his forehead), smoking a cigarette.<br/><br/>"We were told to look for a JS," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"I am Jean Simone. Can I help you?"<br/><br/>"We are interested in visiting Ireland."<br/><br/>"Have a nice trip."<br/><br/>"A certain Mickey Mahoney--"<br/><br/>"Ah, Mahoney. Bah. Next slip over, monsieur."<br/><br/>They round the plane and find a woman with short hair arguing with another French pilot. "I don't want to look at your picture again, Tony! It's a snake eating an elephant, anyone can see that."<br/><br/>"What ho! You would be--"<br/><br/>"Joyce Summers. Oh hey, you must be my charter! Have any of you ever flown before?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Then I won't have to go over the safety procedures. We're ready to leave. I filed a flight plan to...Coventry, England."<br/><br/>"Ah, wink wink, nudge nudge."<br/><br/>"I've done this before."<br/><br/>Freddie heads back to Jean Simone, who is talking to the other pilot. "Gentlemen, if certain irate Frenchwomen or their wives should come looking for me, I'd appreciate it if you told them I went anywhere other than Ireland."<br/><br/>The other pilot lights a cigarette. "Is this a matter of honor, sir? Than a gentleman would never say anything. If you should ever have need of my aid, Saint-Exupery is at your service."<br/><br/>"Freddie Blakely," says Freddie, handing over a card.<br/><br/>"Ah, a newspaperman! I dabble in writing myself. Perhaps we could talk further. I have a very interesting story about a time I crashed in...ah, it's a long story."<br/><br/><br/><br/>They take off nearly vertically. "We'll reach cruising altitude soon. Now, if we should experience engine failure, we will all die. I think that's my safety notice. This is basically a kite with internal combustion engines."<br/><br/>"How do you know Mickey?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Oh, he's great to me, gives me work smuggling guns, smuggling alcohol."<br/><br/>Charleston and Gilbert light up. Joyce tells them that fuel tank number 3 is full of alcohol. (Or was it number 2?) As for guns, there are a lot of those lying around after the Irish Civil War.<br/><br/><i>[Joyce was my first CoC character--thus my nym. This of course is an alt-Joyce who never was a main character in </i>Masks<i>]</i><br/><br/>Despite hitting some bad weather, several hours later they land in the northern part of the Irish Free State. Joyce stencils a picture of a plane on the side of her Fokker. Charleston notices that the string of plane stencils is punctuated frequently by little crash stencils.<br/><br/>They hike into the town of Lesser Edale. The name is English, and hated by the inhabitants, but none of them speak Irish well enough to rename it. They find the local pub, the Laughing Horse, and check in.<br/><br/>"Hello, we're visiting and are hoping to find accommodations here," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Yer a facking Britsher."<br/><br/>"No, I assure you I'm German."<br/><br/>"Whatever makes ye happy. Not all the British are tha' bad, look at the Vanes up the old castle."<br/><br/>"The Gaffigan castle?"<br/><br/>"Gaffigan! Gaffigan! Be very careful saying that name around here. Which Gaffigan d'ye mean? There are sartain Gaffigans we are not friendly with."<br/><br/>"His name begins with E--"<br/><br/>The rest of the pub goes silent. "We don't speak of him here," says the publican.<br/><br/>The rest of the group begins to mingle. Despite their distrust of strangers, the novelty of so many Americans--include a Chinese-American--clearly piques their interest.<br/><br/>The old Gaffer in the corner (there's always an old Gaffer in the corner) tells them that Gaffigan was responsible for the death of half the town's young men in the Easter Rising, and stood by the British to boot. <br/><br/>The crowd begins to shuffle in. "It's gonna wild night," says one. "The wind blows off the moors."<br/><br/>"Aye, that's not all that will stir tonight."<br/><br/>"Shut yer mouth, ye be givin' us the Evil Eye?" say several people.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423739/#Comment_423739" name="Item_314" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-04T20:50:39+00:00" title="November  4, 2013  8:50PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IX: Je serai sur toi d\xe8s que le rayon de lune brillera (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>The local girls find Charleston fascinating. "Airye meeried?" they ask. "D'ye ha' a gel?"<br/><br/><i>[I had probably too much pleasure trotting out Aviatrix's Basket o' Bad Irish Accents for this. I did do some work on picking up an Ulsterish accent for Gavigan; I sorta got the sound right, but the diction is beyond me at present.]</i><br/><br/>"Yes, he does," says Freddie. "A wee lass."<br/><br/>In the corner, Noor looks at the men who have gathered around here over her Coke-bottle glasses.<br/><br/>Gilbert gets the young wives paying attention to him, of course. "Isit true tha' the women in Paris all smoke?"<br/><br/>He blows a long puff of smoke out. "I don't know what you're saying."<br/><br/>Charleston offers to take pictures of the girls. Several of the young men in town begin to glare at him.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Would you like a barfight? One is available!]</i><br/><br/>Freddie begins to pound out some anti-English songs on the piano.<br/><br/>Several of the girls ask Charleston and Jimmy to walk them home. Charleston notices that they seem to be doing more than making a come-on. It turns out that they are afraid of...<br/><br/>"The Divil Dog. They say when the moon is full, it walks the moors, attacking people."<br/><br/>Others chime in. "Me husband went out to barn because he heard something. Shot it wi' his shotgun, an' I saw a hairy beast, not man nor beast."<br/><br/>"I say somethin' like tha'," says a horse dealer. "Me daughter. Somethin' savaged here, kilt her dead. Down by the Vanes' place. They're British an' no damn good, an' I don't care how many friends they have in this town. They're cursed and they need to leave Ireland."<br/><br/>"Aye, I saw one o' the Vanes near his house that night. They're a British family, came over wi' Cromwell. Durin' the Rising they stayed neutral, and they supported the Free State when durin' the Troubles. But still British. Anglo-Irish, like the Shaws."<br/><br/>At that moment a rather well-dressed young man in tweeds walks in. The pub goes silent.<br/><br/>"Talking about me again?" he says.<br/><br/>"Larry! Lawrence Vane! Bloody Larry!" says Freddie, embracing him.<br/><br/>"Oh god, Freddie. Of all the gin joints in all the world you had to walk into mine."<br/><br/><i>[Credit Rating buy by FP to turn Lawrence into a contact.]</i><br/><br/>"Everyone, this is my long-time rival and close enemy Bloody Larry Vane! We called him that because he's vain? Get it? Please don't hit me, Larry."<br/><br/>"How could I refuse an invitation like that?" says Lawrence, and punches Freddie.<br/><br/>Too late Freddie remembers that Vane won the Oxford boxing title one year.<br/><br/>"Are you still upset about what me and Mildred did?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"I'd forgotten that," says Vane, and punches Freddie again. "Now, you must come to dinner, Pater will be royally chuffed if you don't come tomorrow night--wait. Come to breakfast. I'm afraid my sister Eloise will be ill tomorrow."<br/><br/>Freddie and Larry duck outside. "What are you doing in Ireland," hisses Vane. "When I heard you were in New York, I thought, well, there's five thousand miles of water between us--since I can't recall you ever bathing in it or drinking the stuff."<br/><br/>"A friend of mine recommended that I look into Eddie Gaffigan."<br/><br/>"For God's sake, man, don't say that name! He's a bloody traitor! Listen, Freddie, I'm going to give you a piece of advice, Freddie! I'm not fond of you, and I don't want to help you, but drop Gaffigan and don't bring him up anywhere around here, not to the townsfolk, not to Pater, not to me! I am deadly bloody serious about this! Or I can't be held responsible."<br/><br/>"Well, I just need to know some things, where he lived, if he has any relatives--"<br/><br/>"He fled. I hope his former mates tracked him down and gave him the dog's death he deserved. As for where he lived, he and his mother had a house at the edge of the village. After what he did in 1916, the villagers went and tore the house down."<br/><br/>"I hope without his mother inside."<br/><br/>"I can't speak to that, old man."<br/><br/><br/>The party winds down. Jimmy hears some rumors about the local priest, who seems to be spending all his time reading strange books late at night--"He's a very learned man, he reads Latin and Greek."<br/><br/>He also uncovers that the Vanes seem to not have any money, but since the Civil War they've been able to stay in their castle, which seems unusual.<br/><br/>Charleston goes home with one of his fair interlocutors, named Abigail. That night, he has a dream. He hears a noise, as of the sea. He gets up, and throttles the life out of Abigail, while chanting a strange song. Enormous power seems to flow through him.<br/><br/>He wakes up. Abigail is sleeping next to him. He feels a deep loss of power, and the haunting chant seems to be running in his mind.<br/><br/>He wakes her up and makes love to her the rest of the morning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423986/#Comment_423986" name="Item_315" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-08T19:23:44+00:00" title="November  8, 2013  7:23PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IX: Je serai sur toi d\xe8s que le rayon de lune brillera (Part 3)</b><br/><br/><i>Saturday, 6 June 1925: The first night of the full moon</i><br/><br/>In the morning, Francis comes downstairs and meets Jimmy; they expect to meet Freddie and go up to the castle. But neither Freddie nor Gilbert is there. According to the innkeeper, Blakely left in the morning with "some men in a car" and Gilbert went after him.<br/><br/><i>[This is officially from Session 9 now.

The sun is just coming over the horizon, a beautiful Irish morning. They pass through a forested copse of trees. In the fields, they see a young woman riding her horse at breakneck speed. Jimmy's upper class upbringing notices that the horse is running much faster than it normally would even at full gallop. As they watch, the woman tries to jump a fence. At the last moment, her horse bucks and throws her to the ground.<br/><br/>Francis and Jimmy come running up. "Are you all right ma'am?"<br/><br/>"I'm fine," she says. "Eloise Vane. <i>Who</i> are you?" Her eyes sparkle as she looks over Francis.<br/><br/>"Francis O'Donnell. This is my associate, Jimmy Wright."<br/><br/>"Hello," she says to Jimmy curtly and then turns back to Francis. "You're an American, aren't you? I do so <i>love</i> Americans. So brash and bold."<br/><br/>Jimmy leads the horse away. Its eyes are rolling in terror.<br/><br/>"She's so crazy this morning," says Eloise. "But this morning I felt really full of energy, you know? Do you have a cigarette. What brings you to Ireland? Oh, you can just take the horse up to the castle," she says to Jimmy dismissively.<br/><br/>She strokes his hand as he gives her a cigarette. "Would you care to take a walk with me? I could show you the grounds."<br/><br/>They walk up into the ornamental garden. "Why don't you sit with me on this bench? I'm so out of breath from the fall."<br/><br/>"Well, I came to Ireland because it seemed a good opportunity..."<br/><br/>"<i>In</i>deed."<br/><br/>"We're trustworthy...discreet..."<br/><br/>"I think I have something you could help me with..." And she pounces on Francis and begins to kiss him passionately.<br/><br/>Eloise turns out to be surprisingly strong--she knocks him off the bench and rolls on top of him. She begins to unbutton his coat. "This won't take long," she murmurs.<br/><br/>As Jimmy reaches the castle, an enormous, greasy-haired man with a heavy beard shadow and a unibrow comes over. "Where is the girl?"<br/><br/>"She's talking with my associate...name's Jimmy, by the way."<br/><br/>"G\xe9vaud. The groundskeeper. I am from Lyon. We will put the horse in the stable and then find her."<br/><br/>"I was just in Paris, you know."<br/><br/>"Parisians are all idiots. If you were in Paris, you are a ridiculous person."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis is in the middle of a delicate situation when suddenly he is pulled by his hair away from Eloise. G\xe9vaud drags him by the neck into the sunlight.<br/><br/>"G\xe9vaud, you are a terrible person. Let go of my friend," says Eloise.<br/><br/>"Shut up!"<br/><br/>The two of them begin to argue loudly. Francis waits for a moment, and then punches G\xe9vaud hard in the throat.<br/><br/>"I'm going to tear you apart," he growls. He grabs Francis by the throat again and begins to lift him off the ground.<br/><br/>Francis puts a hard kick into the Frenchman's groin.<br/><br/>G\xe9vaud drops Francis, and then throws him against a column and begins to pummel him. Eloise smacks him across the face with her riding crop. "Stop it, you idiot!"<br/><br/>Blood drips down G\xe9vaud's face. He glares at Eloise with a look that Francis recognizes too well--the look of a man who could kill her.<br/><br/>Eloise runs back to the castle.<br/><br/>"Stupid whore," grumbles G\xe9vaud. "I could kill her. Most of the time she infuriates me. But sometimes...there's something about her."<br/><br/>Eventually they enter the main hall of Castle Plum. Eloise meets them and takes Jimmy and Francis to the sitting room, where they are taking breakfast.<br/><br/>"I never!" says Sir Arthur Vane. Lady Jane Vane nearly drops her teacup. Lawrence buries his face in his hands.<br/><br/>"Sir, milady. My name is Francis O'Donnell. I came here so I could help you."<br/><br/>"I'd say you have to help yourself first," says Lawrence.<br/><br/>"G\xe9vaud was being an utter prat, mater," says Eloise. <br/><br/>"Well...uh...have some tea, old man," says Sir Arthur.<br/><br/>Eloise begins to plow into some blood sausage. "I'm so hungry today," she says. "Mater, pater, Francis and Jimmy are going to stay with us tonight, aren't they?"<br/><br/>"Well..."<br/><br/>"I SAID THEY WERE GOING TO STAY HERE!"<br/><br/>"All right, dear," says Sir Arthur. "We'd be delighted to have you. Lawrence will give you the tour, won't you son?"<br/><br/>"Overjoyed," says Larry, with clenched jaw.<br/><br/>Sir Arthur takes Lady Vane, who looks very pale, up to her room. "Make yourself...at home," he says.<br/><br/>"Look, I know I've stepped into a mess here," says Francis.<br/><br/>"You've definitely stepped in it, old man."<br/><br/>"Well, I just want you to know I'm trustworthy. I've helped people out of troubles before."<br/><br/>"Some troubles, old man...our family has problems that you can't help with."<br/><br/>"Jimmy, why don't you help get our stuff?" says Francis. As Jimmy starts to leave, Francis grabs his arm. "Find out what you can in town, and look into the priest," he whispers.<br/><br/>Back at the pub, the locals are in an uproar about a sheep that was torn to pieces the night before. "'Tis the Divil Dog!" they say.<br/><br/>Jimmy takes a walk out on the moors. Soon he comes across a clump of people gathered around the body of the sheep. He doesn't recognize the tracks around the corpse, but it does look like the sheep was killed by some kind of large predator.<br/><br/><i>[Forensics use by Jimmy.]</i><br/><br/>"Pretty gruesome, huh?" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"'Twas the Divil Dog!" says one of the bystanders.<br/><br/>"Go on, yer mad," says another.<br/><br/>"Nay, I saw it!" says a third.<br/><br/>"You saw it?" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Saw something. A huge dark shadow on the moors."<br/><br/>"Go on," say the others.<br/><br/>"What about Tom Cordy and his daughter?" insists the man who "saw" the Devil Dog.<br/><br/>"Ah, he's in the sauce half the time, isna he?" the crowd responds.<br/><br/>Jimmy resolves to go to the church and talk to the priest.<br/><br/><i>[FP: If I become a werewolf, do I stay a PC?<br/>Me: Yes...most of the time.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424040/#Comment_424040" name="Item_316" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T20:00:50+00:00" title="November 10, 2013  8:00PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2013 6:54PM by Aviatrix.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IX: Je serai sur toi d\xe8s que le rayon de lune brillera (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Father O'Leary lives in the rectory of the church. Jimmy knocks on the door.<br/><br/>"Can I help ye?" says the Father's housekeeper, a  pleasant-looking, middle-aged woman.<br/><br/>"Top o' the morning. You do say that, don't you?"<br/><br/>"Er...sometimes we do."<br/><br/>"I'm here to see the Father."<br/><br/>"An' what's the nature of yer visit?"<br/><br/>"Confession."<br/><br/>"Confessions are later in the day...but...oh, if it's a matter of deep conscience..."<br/><br/>She takes him in to the sitting room. Father O'Leary eventually enters. Deep bags are under his eyes, and Jimmy thinks he is losing his hair. "How can I help ye, me son?"<br/><br/>"You don't look so good, Father."<br/><br/>"Ah, well...we all must wrestle with our own demons. Even those of us who take the cloth must do battle with Satan."<br/><br/>"Sometimes it seems those demons are really present with us."<br/><br/>"That's a...strange way of puttin' it. Not too many in this scientific age would credit such an idea. But I think that traces of the elder world hang around us. May I say, you don't look Catholic."<br/><br/>"Was raised Protestant."<br/><br/>"Well, we all have our own moral failings. Now, is there something in particular I can help you with? Otherwise, I have to be gettin' back to my work...and oh God, I have a sermon to write for tomorrow..."<br/><br/>Jimmy explains to the priest that he has heard about how he locks himself up at night, and the concerns about his health. And also, the rumors of dogs on the moor.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance use by Jimmy.]</i><br/><br/>"Certainly there are strange events...I believe God is testing us...He tests all of us in different ways...and sometimes he tests families...you don't speak Greek, d'ye?"<br/><br/>Father O'Leary tells Jimmy that he found a journal from one of his predecessors, part of which was written in Greek. He began to translate it...but the things he read were very disturbing. He also recommends that Jimmy not go out when the moon is full, and avoid Castle Plum.<br/><br/>"What do you think of the daughter?" asks Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I think sometimes God damns people even if they haven't done something themselves...that girl's lost. And there's nothing I can do for her."<br/><br/>Jimmy begs for a look at the book, but the Father refuses, claiming it's too dangerous. Jimmy notices that poor man can't help but glance back at his desk when he talks about the book.<br/><br/>Jimmy politely takes his leave. He notes that there will be a vespers Mass that evening.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Back at Castle Plum, Larry gives Francis a reluctant tour. Francis tries to feel him out for any tells that Lawrence might give off. He notices two things: there's another floor above the guest floor that Lawrence won't take him, and his tour of the wine cellar is a bit forced. Lawrence off-handedly mentions that there used to be another cellar that was used in the old days. Francis suspects that there is another exit in the wine cellar.<br/><br/>When they reach the parlor, Eloise stops Francis.<br/><br/>"Hello, Lady Eloise," says Francis.<br/><br/>"Oh, I'm not a lady. Is your room comfortable?"<br/><br/>"Quite. Lawrence was about to show me the grounds?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I could do that."<br/><br/>Lawrence's face is draining of blood. "Dearest, G\xe9vaud is working outside. Perhaps you'll want to wait?"<br/><br/>"Well, Francis, you could at least come take tea in my apartment."<br/><br/>"There's nothing I could refuse you."<br/><br/>Eloise heads back up to the family wing. Lawrence speaks softly to Francis: "Listen old man, if you know what's good for you you'll stay far away from her right now. She's not herself--you know how women get," he ends rather unconvincingly.<br/><br/>Francis bows to him.<br/><br/>Lighting a cigarette with shaking hands, Lawrence says, "I'll tell you one thing. Don't drink the wine tonight."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy waits until he sees Father O'Leary walking to the church. He slips around behind the rectory. The priest's housekeeper is inside, tidying the tea service. Jimmy creeps to the pantry, slides open a window, and steps inside.<br/><br/>He pulls out a small skeleton key stamped "Property of F. O'Donnell" and unlocks the rolltop desk. Inside is a battered leatherbound journal.<br/><br/><i>[Locksmith buy from JP, after being told that it would take about ten minutes with just a Locksmith use.]</i><br/><br/>Part of the journal is in English, but there is a lengthy section in Greek. And then Jimmy finds a hand-drawn picture of a huge wolf attacking someone. The Greek text gets extremely haphazard at this point.<br/><br/>In the back of the book is a cheat sheet that O'Leary has been compiling to help with his translation. There's an entry for "Vane family" on it. When Jimmy looks at the page with the picture of the wolf, he sees those characters everywhere on the page.<br/><br/>As he slides back out the window, Jimmy knocks over a lamp. The housekeeper calls out "Who's there?" as he flees back into town.<br/><br/><i>[Jimmy's Drive remains Bad Luck.]</i><br/><br/>When he gets back to the pub, he finds a card inviting him to dinner. There's also a note from Francis telling him to not drink the wine if he comes to dinner.<br/><br/>The constable enters. "Mr. Wright, I have to ask a few questions. Can ye give your whereabouts around 5 pm?"<br/><br/>"Oh...I was...over here, talking with my friend the publican."<br/><br/>"Ah...that's right, constable. Jimmy was here the whole time, tellin' me about America," says the publican.<br/><br/>"All right. I'll have to keep looking. Do you know where Mr. O'Donnell was?"<br/><br/>"Up at the castle."<br/><br/>"Well, I'll have to keep looking. We've got someone around who'd steal from a priest, and that's a pretty low person."<br/><br/>After the constable leaves, Jimmy explains to the astonished bartender that the priest knows something about what has been going on with the Devil Dog--nothing untoward, but something that has frightened the poor man. Jimmy lifted the journal to help him out. <br/><br/>"The less you know, the better off you are," says Jimmy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dinner is held rather early (more of a late tea) but they still dress for it--even Jimmy, who arrives freshly scrubbed and stuffed into his best tuxedo. Francis makes sure to strap on his backup piece in an ankle holster.<br/><br/>Jimmy of course takes his little spy-model camera and tucks it into the small of his back.<br/><br/>As Francis makes his way to the dining room, Eloise grabs him. "I've had this horrible feeling all day...like something awful is going to happen. And...I get these blackouts sometimes..."<br/><br/>"Why is your family so afraid of you?"<br/><br/>"Well, I suppose it's because they can't deal with a modern liberated woman. But sometimes...I think it's more than that. I get so temperamental sometimes...just watch over me, and make sure that nothing happens to me."<br/><br/>"You have my word."<br/><br/><i>[OP: Shit!<br/>Me: Ha!

As he pages through the journal, O'Donnell notices that the writing seems to get more and more disturbed over time. The dates of the entries are in the 1770s.<br/><br/>"Just because there was a wolf creature a hundred and fifty years ago doesn't mean anything today," says Francis.<br/><br/>"The horse was terrified of her!" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Right, because horses are elegant creatures who are never frightened of anything," says Francis. "They're just stoic."<br/><br/>"It got calmer the further we moved from her!"<br/><br/>"Or a beetle. Look, she's frightened of something, and darn it, I'm going to help her." Privately, Francis believes that Eloise is a manic-depressive.<br/><br/>Dinner goes perfectly calmly for the first several courses, until the roast is served.<br/><br/>Eloise throws her plate on the floor. "This is horribly overcooked!"<br/><br/>Jimmy looks at his slice--it's perfectly done, just a little pink in the middle.<br/><br/>"We should have fired cook years ago!" snarls Eloise. "I don't know how you can eat this!"<br/><br/>She takes a huge swig of wine from her glass. For a moment she looks confused. <br/><br/>Then she faints, collapsing back into her chair.<br/><br/>Sir Arthur and Lawrence immediately stand up. "You'd best go off to your rooms," says Larry. "We'll take care of Eloise. She's a bit sick, you must have noticed her acting strangely."<br/><br/>Jimmy examines Eloise, checking her pupils and her breathing. He quickly concludes that she has been drugged.<br/><br/>Lawrence and Sir Arthur start to pick up Eloise. "You should head back to your rooms, we'll send food if you're hungry."<br/><br/>"Eloise came to me," says Francis, "and said she was in distress."<br/><br/>"She is in distress old man. She's a very sick girl."<br/><br/>"Then why does she have free reign over the castle? Why has she put the fear of God into you?"<br/><br/>Lady Vane begins to cry.<br/><br/>"Listen old man," says Lawrence, "this is a family matter. And if you have a problem with that, I invite you to leave."<br/><br/>"I'd happily leave, if I didn't think you meant harm to her."<br/><br/>"We don't mean her any harm. She's very ill, and we're taking her to her room."<br/><br/>"Sir Arthur," says Francis, "Let me help. There's many things I can do, I see you're in peril--"<br/><br/>"Please don't make this any harder on me," says Lady Vane, clutching Francis' arm. "I know you mean well, but this is just making it worse!"<br/><br/><i>[Soft Driver for Francis to not make Lady Vane cry.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy begins to feel ill, suddenly. The room begins to go woozy.<br/><br/><i>[Health test for Jimmy, TN 5.]</i><br/><br/>He sits down hard on a chair. Francis suddenly feels just as bad. He grabs the back of a chair, fighting to stay conscious. <br/><br/>"I was about to leave quietly," says Francis.<br/><br/>"You'll leave quietly now, old man," says Larry with a smirk, as servants drag Francis and Jimmy upstairs to their room.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Time passes. Jimmy's bed seems to swing through three axes. A few times he tries to stand up but the effort is beyond him.<br/><br/>OWWW-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! <br/><br/>Jimmy listens carefully. The howling seems to be coming from inside the castle.<br/><br/>On the other side of the building, Francis drags himself to his suitcase and fumbles inside until he finds some smelling salts. <br/><br/>OWWWWWW-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!<br/><br/>This howling comes from outside the castle. Francis looks out the window but sees nothing on the moonlight moors.<br/><br/>As he dresses and puts on his pistol holster, Francis hears footsteps coming from the locked third floor. Voices murmur for a moment on the landing, and then there are more footsteps as the people descend the stairs.<br/><br/>Francis creeps to Jimmy's door. "Jimmy, it's Francis."<br/><br/>"How do I know it's you?"<br/><br/>"Open the [censored] door!"<br/><br/>Jimmy opens the door. "She's a wolf! She's going to eat us!"<br/><br/>OWWWW-OOOOOOOOO!<br/><br/>"She's not a monster! We're going to find her and protect her!" says Francis. He gives Jimmy his holdout piece. "They must have drugged the tea," he says as they head to Eloise's room.<br/><br/>"I thought there was too much clove! Anyway, we should get out here! This is like one of those Gothic novels!"<br/><br/><i>[Stability check time for our intrepid heroes. Of course, this was the point my cats came out to act cute--thanks guys, NICE ATMOSPHERE.]</i><br/><br/>"No, it's Conan Doyle," whispers Francis. They pass Sir and Lady Vane's apartment. A woman is crying inside, and they can hear Sir Arthur comforting her.<br/><br/>Eloises' room is vacant. They quietly search the room. Francis finds Eloise's journal. He quickly checks to see how her entries coordinate with the full moon. In every case he checks, the entries get more and more disorganized right before the full moon. Then several days are missing; when the journal entries resume, the writing seems very depressed.<br/><br/>Behind a dresser, Jimmy finds a single sheet from a letter. There's a number on it, as if was part of a sequence:<br/><br/><i>My dearest Eloise,<br/><br/>I think of you constantly. I wish I didn't have to be so far away...</i><br/><br/>He skips to the end, where it is signed, "Love, E."<br/><br/>Internal evidence from the letter suggests that it was written by somebody local, from the village...someone who is no longer there...<br/><br/>Jimmy and Francis descend to the wine cellar. They find a door concealed behind one wine rack. Ten minutes of work springs the lock. A narrow staircase lit by electric bulbs leads down. The sound of howling, growling and barking comes from below.<br/><br/>During a break in the clamor, Jimmy thinks he hears voices coming from below.<br/><br/>They go down. At the bottom of the staircase they find a room covered thickly with dust. There are bulky implements scattered around the room that suggest this room was once the castle's torture chamber.<br/><br/>A crack of light comes from under a heavy iron door in the far wall. The howling is coming from behind the door, along with the faint sounds of a conversation.<br/><br/>Francis pounds on the door, and then stands next to it with his gun drawn.<br/><br/>The conversation stops.<br/><br/>There is the sound of the bolt unlatching. Francis yanks open the door and flattens himself against the wall. He catches a glimpse of several ancient cells for holding prisoners beyond it.<br/><br/>Something howls from inside the cell block. There is the sound of something heavy hitting a door from around the corner, further down the the cells.<br/><br/>There is the sound of hinges beginning to creak as the slamming noise continues.<br/><br/>"You're in trouble," yells Francis. "Come on out, before whatever's in there gets out."<br/><br/>Lawrence Vane walks out. "I told you, this is a family matter."<br/><br/>"Lawrence, what's going on?"<br/><br/>"You really don't have much time. Go on upstairs, and I'll lock up. We're having a bit of a pest control issue."<br/><br/>"Where's Eloise?"<br/><br/>"She's safe. She's not in any more trouble than she was now." Lawrence keeps glancing back as he talks to Francis. Then with a sigh, he steps out into the torture room.<br/><br/>Two other men scamper out, one with a drawn Luger. "All right, all right," says one of them, a portly Englishman with a bristle mustache. <br/><br/>"Who the hell are you?" says Francis.<br/><br/>"Clive. Dr. Henry Clive. This is my associate, Mr. Sprech."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424079/#Comment_424079" name="Item_319" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-11T21:55:48+00:00" title="November 11, 2013  9:55PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So she doesn't know the truth?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424101/#Comment_424101" name="Item_320" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-12T10:05:17+00:00" title="November 12, 2013 10:05AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2013 10:05AM by Aviatrix.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No. What she may suspect, I don't know, but it is generally a pretty big leap from "lost time" to "werewolf." :-)<br/><br/>Given that Gaffigan was her lover, keeping her away from the town probably makes sense as well.<br/><br/>I have to say, OP did a good job playing his PC's disbelief.

We're taking care of her."<br/><br/>"By drugging her?"<br/><br/>"We gave her a powerful muscle relaxant, to keep her from hurting herself."<br/><br/>"She doesn't know what's going on, does she?" says Jimmy. "Why haven't you told her?"<br/><br/>"And how would you react to that, Mr. Wright?"<br/><br/>"What happens to your sister when she's older, when people try to understand why she's not married, why she can't bring life into this world?" says Francis to Lawrence.<br/><br/>"I'm afraid her heart is already taken, and that is a match which can never be publicly acknowledged," says Lawrence, pouring another drink.<br/><br/>"She has all of you under this fear, but she was able to bring a stranger in here! She'll be able to leave one day!"<br/><br/>"Look old man, we've got this under control," says Clive. "Nobody's died--not here. And I assure you, Eloise was always inside the castle when her condition is such."<br/><br/>"How do you explain what's been happening?" demands Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Some random dog I should suppose."<br/><br/>"How did she get this condition?" says Francis.<br/><br/>"Well...you see, old man...it's a bit of a family curse," says Lawrence. "The Vane women get it...they have this condition."<br/><br/>"For a hundred and fifty years?"<br/><br/>"At least that long, I should say. It doesn't die out, either--we've had generations of only sons, but as soon as another daughter is born, she gets it."<br/><br/>"Why haven't you done the logical thing and stopped breeding?"<br/><br/>"Well, it's fifty-fifty each time. I'm rather glad I'm here. And Eloise is safe."<br/><br/>"Except that she's afraid. Except that she's unhappy. She went to a total stranger for help--you don't think that will happen? I won't be the last, and one day she'll escape. Now, who is better to help her--somebody who's been exposed to these things, who can deal with the fact that she's a wolf, or somebody else, who won't know what to do? What would have done tonight if somebody else had been at the door downstairs?"<br/><br/>As if on cue, Jimmy sees the door to the kitchen begin to open. A wolf the size of a pony is standing there.<br/><br/>It leaps onto the dining room table, which collapses. Clive and Sprech sprint for the stairs. The wolf stands there growling at Lawrence, Jimmy and Francis.<br/><br/><i>[Stability checks all around!]</i><br/><br/>The wolf sniffs at the door to the wine cellar. Jimmy sprints for the doorway, but gets tripped up as Francis blasts past him. Jimmy finds himself between the wolf and the wine cellar door.<br/><br/>Francis gets to the stairs, notices Jimmy is missing, and heads back to the dining room.<br/><br/><i>[Fleeing checks. Jimmy failed, Francis made his. I gave Francis a point of Stability for following his Drive here, and Jimmy 2 points for his horrid luck.]</i><br/><br/>The wolf stares at Jimmy, who is sitting against the wall, trying to scramble up. Somehow words form in his head.<br/><br/><i>You keep her. You die.</i><br/><br/>Francis runs in, leaps up  onto a chair, and shoots the wolf point blank behind his ear.<br/><br/><i>[2 point Athletics spend in addition to the Firearms check.]</i><br/><br/>Blood sprays all over the room. The wolf yelps and rolls away. As Francis watches, the blood flow almost immediately stops, and the shot, which would have crippled or killed most people, hasn't seemed to slow the wolf at all.<br/><br/>"Jimmy get out--" shouts Francis as the wolf springs at him. The bone-shuddering impact blows him completely through the wall of the dining room. Plaster and lathing explode around him. The wolf's eyes seem to glow red.<br/><br/>Francis crawls to his feet and runs for the door. The wolf follows him to the threshold, and then howls. Francis keeps running the mile or so into town.<br/><br/>Jimmy runs upstairs. From below, he hears an enormous crash, as if a door had been knocked down. The wolf howls. From the basement comes a howl in response.<br/><br/>He opens a window, slides down a tree, and lopes like a gazelle through the moonlight. Soon he's on Francis' heels. <br/><br/>As they reach the edge of the village, Francis hears howling from the castle. Maybe it's his imagination, but he hears rage, pain, and frustration in the wordless cry. He slows down, thinking. Thinking about how solid the door in the basement is, and how it was designed to be wolf-proof. And how that will anger the wolf that attacked them. Which he left. Alone in the castle.<br/><br/>Where it will massacre everyone in revenge.<br/><br/>He stops dead. His shoulders droop.<br/><br/><i>[His Drive hits again.]</i><br/><br/>"Jimmy," says Francis, "go find all the explosives that you can.

So let's catch up! When last we left off, Francis had just realized that he had left the Vane family to be devoured by a werewolf...]</i><br/><br/>Francis bursts into the Laughing Horse pub. "The Devil Dog is in the castle! Let's go kill it!"<br/><br/>"The Devil Dog!" shouts the crowd. They quickly gather outside with pitchforks and weapons left over from the Civil War.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Jimmy heads down to the plane. He doesn't see anyone as he comes up, but suddenly hears the click of a pistol.<br/><br/>"Ah jeez, it's you," says Joyce. An Irish girl is hiding behind her. Wearing only a blanket.<br/><br/>"Ah. Oh! AH! Sorry, I just need some dynamite," says Jimmy. He drags a case out from the back of the plane. "There may be some explosions. Oh, and enjoy the rest of your night."<br/><br/>"Well, I would but you've ruined the mood," mutters the pilot.<br/><br/>Jimmy meets Francis back at the plane with a car he liberates from a farmhouse on the way. Together the crowd makes their way to Castle Plum. They pause on the doorstep, unnerved by the sudden howling they hear from inside.<br/><br/>"Ye didn't tell us there were two divil dogs," says the publican. About half the crowd looks like it is about to run back to the village. "There's nothing to fear, boys! Come on!" says Francis.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance buy from FP to keep the crowd together.]</i><br/><br/>In the kitchen they find the broken window that the wolf used to get in the castle. The dining room is slick with blood, and the door to the wine cellar is ripped down. There's still howling coming from the basement.<br/><br/>"Where's Sir Arthur and Lady Vane?" mutter some of the crowd. "Let's go check on 'em."<br/><br/>The crowd heads upstairs. They come upon a trail of blood. On the second story they find a chambermaid with her head ripped from her body. Some of the crowd melt away. <br/><br/>Eloise's room has been completely wrecked, all the furniture smashed to pieces.<br/><br/>In the Vanes' bedroom, they find Sir Arthur dead on the floor, with a look of horror on his face that they will all take to their graves. Sitting on the bed is Lady Vane, her eyes staring blankly, sanity having long since fled. Over and over she whispers, "Lawrence...Lawrence...Lawrence..."<br/><br/>The howling from the basement has stopped.<br/><br/>"We'll take her back to town in the car," says some members of the mob, relieved to be able to do something useful that takes them away from the castle.<br/><br/>"I don't think we can stay here tonight," says Francis. "I don't think we can beat the beast. Everyone should leave now."<br/><br/><i>[FP deliberately broke their morale, hoping that getting them to run in a solid mass would protect them...]</i><br/><br/>The crowd bolts from the castle, running back to the village. Jimmy and Francis leg it out with them, just in time to see a gigantic wolf leap into the crowd, scattering them and ripping out their throats.<br/><br/>Everyone runs in the opposite direction--only to scatter again when <i>a second gigantic wolf</i> suddenly appears and charges into them.<br/><br/><i>[I gave the PCs a point of stability--and then asked for a 6-point test for the general schrecklichkeit.]</i><br/><br/>As Jimmy and Francis run towards the village, the last thing they see is the two wolves rolling together, howling and yipping at each other.<br/><br/>They spend the night with the survivors barricaded in the pub. Several people casually inform them that they're going to be dead men soon. <br/><br/>In the morning, Francis gathers Jimmy, Charleston and Noor and they sneak out of the pub and drive back to the plane.<br/><br/>On the way there they come upon Eloise Vane, wandering naked and dazed by the road.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425007/#Comment_425007" name="Item_324" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-30T06:52:22+00:00" title="November 30, 2013  6:52AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IX: Je serai sur toi d\xe8s que le rayon de lune brillera (Part 8)</b><br/><br/><i>Sunday, 7 June 1925: The second night of the full moon</i><br/><br/>"Francis, I've had the most unusual dreams," says Eloise as soon as he comes up. He slips his coat over her shoulders.<br/><br/>"It's all right. Come with us."<br/><br/>They drive up to the plane. Joyce is sitting on top of it with a pistol drawn, aiming at G\xe9vaud, who is standing in the road holding a club the size of a railroad tie.<br/><br/>"Ah good. I was expecting you to come. Hand the girl over to me. She is mine now."<br/><br/>"I tried shooting at him," shouts Joyce. "He's not frightened of it!"<br/><br/>Francis draws his pistol. "You can take her when you pry her from my cold, dead fingers," he says.<br/><br/>"That would be my pleasure," says G\xe9vaud, as he transforms into a gigantic wolf.<br/><br/><i>[Jimmy &amp; Francis both got a point of Stability for their drives, then had to make a 4 point test.]</i><br/><br/>Francis sprints back to the car. "Go, Jimmy, go!" The car lurches forward and tears off down the country lane leading from the plane.<br/><br/>G\xe9vaud races after them, moving faster than any normal animal could, keeping pace with them as they drive. Francis shoves Jimmy aside and tries to dodge down another road. <br/><br/>With a roar of engines and a rush of wind, the Fokker Trimotor stoops down on them. Just barely keeping above stall speed, Joyce paces the racing car. Jimmy swings Eloise up into the plane, followed by Charleston and Noor. Then he shoves Francis aside.<br/><br/>"Get in the plane!" he shouts. Francis leaps for the edge of the door and barely catches the edge. Jimmy clambers over him and pulls him inside as the car spins out of control into a tree. G\xe9vaud changes back to human form and shakes his fist as the plane rapidly climbs into the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They return to Paris. Francis calls Mickey Mahoney and asks for medicine, venison, two sets of clothes, and a safe house--one with a very secure area to hold somebody. Mickey sends them to an abandoned building on the outskirts of the city. A large section of the floor has been ripped up, exposing a two-storey deep basement. "Forget about this conversation," says Mahoney. "And if you happen to dig up anything, forget about that too."<br/><br/>Francis takes Eloise to the safe house. Jimmy heads down to the Sorbonne and hires a couple of English-speaking students to help him find out information on werewolves. The only thing he finds that seems useful is that apparently silver weapons will hurt a werewolf.<br/><br/>Jimmy goes to Mahoney. "I need silver bullets. And wolfsbane." He drops a bag with silver candlesticks on his desk. (It makes a very interesting line item on his next expense report to Bradley Grey.)<br/><br/>"Let me get this straight. Francis says he has a strange beast. And you tell me you need silver bullets and wolfsbane."<br/><br/>"Don't worry. It's not going to come back to bite you on the ass. Well, not figuratively..."<br/><br/>Mahoney sets Jimmy up with a weaponsmith and a pharmacist--aconite, the drug derived from wolfsbane is still used as a heart medicine.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Francis makes a "post-turn" kit, with food, booze, and a change of clothes. He lowers Eloise down into the pit.<br/><br/>"Francis are you leaving me down here alone?"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid so," says Francis, turning away. Shortly after that, a horrible howling begins. (Strangely enough--or maybe not--the building is well soundproofed.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425009/#Comment_425009" name="Item_325" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-30T08:17:16+00:00" title="November 30, 2013  8:17AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IX: Je serai sur toi d\xe8s que le rayon de lune brillera (Part 9)</b><br/><br/><i>Monday, 8 June 1925: the third night of the full moon</i><br/><br/>Eloise doesn't escape to eat the neighborhood, fortunately. Francis spends the night smoking and watching over the pit.<br/><br/>In the morning, Francis lowers himself into the pit. Eloise, naked and covered with bruises, stares coldly at him. "Rapist!" she screams.<br/><br/>At this moment Jimmy breezes into the building with coffee and breakfast. "He didn't rape you, ma'am. Coffee?"<br/><br/>"You left me alone in a pit! Where's my mother? Where's my father? Where's Lawrence?" shouts Eloise.<br/><br/>"Eloise, we're in Paris. You're very sick. During the night, do you remember what happened?"<br/><br/>"No, you must have drugged me!"<br/><br/>Francis gives Eloise her journal. "That's mine! How did you get that?"<br/><br/>"Eloise, you asked me to help you, and I will. What I'm going to say will be hard for you to understand.

Why did we run away?"<br/><br/>"Because...because....oh God...oh my God...I...I remember everything..."<br/><br/>She retreats into a corner and starts throwing up.<br/><br/><i>["Realizing you have committed cannibalism" is a 6-point Stability test.

I didn't roll for her Stability test or anything (Jimmy's Bad Luck made sure she remembered everything), but I treated her as if she had been blasted; she went into PTSD and spent most of the remainder of the day in thousand-yard stare mode.]</i><br/><br/>Francis tells Jimmy to go and fetch his copy of Lord Byron poems. Jimmy takes that opportunity to drop in on his sister Lucy and her husband Thomas, who live in Paris.<br/><br/>"Jimmy!" says Lucy.<br/><br/>"We don't have any money," says Thomas.<br/><br/>Lucy gives him a look. <br/><br/>"But come and have lunch," sighs Thomas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy takes his leave, handing over a check ("We'll just wait to see if this clears," says Thomas) and a warning to not go out that night. He heads over to Montmartre to go to Francis' place. As he huffs up to the the sixth-floor walkup, he sees a tough guy standing outside the door of Francis' apartment, smoking. A quick conversation with Francis neighbor in the next door building confirms that two guys arrived yesterday--one is hiding in the apartment. He runs over to the Left Bank and picks up an English-language copy of Byron's poems at Shakespeare and Co.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble roll from JP]</i><br/><br/>Eventually Jimmy gets back to the safe house. "This is in English," says Francis. "Didn't you get to my place?"<br/><br/>Jimmy explains about what he found in Montmartre. "Do me a favor," says Francis. "Go back to your hotel and get all your stuff. Then meet me back here--wait, strike that.

The pistol goes off, narrowly missing his head.<br/><br/><i>[Actually, 3 points of damage, but above zero it's mostly metaphoric.]</i><br/><br/>Francis grabs her and knocks the gun out of her hands. Eloise spins and claws him...wait, CLAWS?<br/><br/>Gathering himself, Francis leaps at Eloise, knocking her backwards. They both plunge two stories to the bottom of the pit.

Suddenly he is knocked off his feet. An enormous fist closes around his throat.<br/><br/>"Take me to her now, little man, or I will twist your head off," say G\xe9vaud. <br/><br/>Jimmy croaks compliance and takes them to his car. The enormous groundskeeper sticks his head out of the window, sniffing.<br/><br/>"I can smell her on you," he says. "I will kill the big one first and eat him. You I will toss to my love." He laughs horribly.<br/><br/>Jimmy drives slowly around Paris, trying to put off the werewolf. "The city stinks of asphalt and gasoline. Also a perfectly adequate Pinot Noir."<br/><br/>"That's amazing."<br/><br/>"I used to be a wine taster. It's the nose."<br/><br/>"Really? How did that work--"<br/><br/>"Don't try and distract me!"<br/><br/>Meekly Jimmy drives up to the safe house. G\xe9vaud leaps out. Jimmy slams on the horn as loud as possible, trying to warn Francis.<br/><br/>G\xe9vaud bursts through the door. "You!" he shouts at Francis.<br/><br/>"You..."<br/><br/>G\xe9vaud throws himself at Francis.<br/><br/><i>[FP: Congratulations, you've killed us both!]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy shudders in the car. Luckily Francis has those silver bullets he gave him. The ones just like these in his pocket...uh oh.<br/><br/><i>[I gave Jimmy a two point Stability refresh for making his own horrible luck.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy runs towards the building. Francis glances around--he made sure to bar every door and window. "I only want to keep her safe!" he shouts.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by FP]</i><br/><br/>"You want to keep her safe?" says G\xe9vaud. "Then go keep her safe." He picks up Francis and throws him into the pit.<br/><br/>Francis manages to slow his fall and land more or less on his feet. He crawls back to the wall of the pit. From the shadows comes a low, feral growling.<br/><br/>"Nice doggie?" he says.<br/><br/><i>[The Reassurance buy kept G\xe9vaud from tearing Francis to pieces, although it was definitely out of the frying pan for him. But it sets up...]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy runs into the building. He doesn't see anyone--not Francis, and not G\xe9vaud.<br/><br/>He hears a bang from somewhere in the dark. "I just want to get my friend and we'll leave and never bother you again..."<br/><br/>HOOOOWWWWWLLLLL.... is the only response. <br/><br/>Jimmy looks around nervously. Suddenly a huge dark shadow leaps from the dark. He dodges past it and fires his pistol at it. A bullet catches the wolf in the side and it yelps. Then it glares at Jimmy. Once again, words form in his head:<br/><br/><i>Run.</i><br/><br/>Down in the pit, Francis desperately pulls out a scarf from his pocket--one of Sir Arthur's scarves that he picked up in Castle Plum. Eloise sniffs it and begins to whine softly.<br/><br/><i>[...the most AWESOME BIOLOGY SPEND ever! Yeah, a one-point spend to "convince Eloise I'm in her pack" so we improvised the detail of the scarf.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy finally bolts for the door. The wolf snaps its jaws just inches behind him as he gets through the door and runs for the car.<br/><br/>In the pit, Francis sees a wolf stick its head over the side, two stories above him. Suddenly it leaps into the air and lands easily. It struts over to Francis and Eloise. <br/><br/>Eloise snarls. Her form shifts slightly until she looks like a hybrid between a wolf and a human. She stares at the G\xe9vaud-wolf, and then says in a harsh growl:<br/><br/>"I can smell them on your breath!"<br/><br/>She leaps at the surprised G\xe9vaud and throws him to the ground. Then she rips his throat out with her teeth.<br/><br/>She paces back to Francis. "You abandoned them to die," she says to him in the same guttural voice.<br/><br/>"I saved your mother! I saved who I could! I came back, I came back for them, and for you!"<br/><br/>"Still you must be marked," she says. A claw flashes out and Francis blacks out.<br/><br/><i>[One point of Health rating lost, and FP's choice of permanent marks--he decided on a long scar leading from his throat to over his chest, just high enough that it cannot easily be concealed even when he wears a collared shirt.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the morning, he slowly comes awake. The ladder is there. Eloise is not.<br/><br/>He finds her clothes taken, and no sign of her. The body of G\xe9vaud--returned to human form--he leaves in the pit.<br/><br/>Outside he finds Jimmy pulling up with coffee and a couple of baguettes.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, good to see you're alive."<br/><br/>"Did you kill G\xe9vaud?"<br/><br/>"No, Eloise did. After remembering everything. I guess I made her the only the person she could end up being. Someone with just enough control over the wolf."<br/><br/>Francis makes his way back to Montmartre. As he wearily climbs up the stairs in his building to the floor his apartment is on, a tough-looking character in a bad suit meets him. "Boss wants to talk to you. Kept me waiting two days, I think you should come if you know what's good for you."<br/><br/>Francis shakes his head. "Let's go."<br/><br/>They drive down to Belleville, stopping at a seedy restaurant. A man stands out front, urging his young daughter to sing for coins: "Come on, Edith, sing for the nice man." Francis shoves past them and enters the building.<br/><br/>A jazz band plays loudly in one corner. In the back, he finds a small room that is closed off with a sliding wooden door. The thug motions him inside.<br/><br/>Gavigan stands up as Francis enters. "Ah, the private investigator, please sit down." The thug closes the panel behind them and stands in the corner, arms crossed.<br/><br/>"I understand you took a little trip to Ireland recently," says Gavigan suavely.<br/><br/>"I think I met a friend of yours. This look familiar to you?" He takes out the letter he found Eloise's room and hands it to Gavigan.<br/><br/>He reads it carefully and then folds it up. "I see," he says calmly, and stands up.<br/><br/>Then he kicks over the table and leaps on Francis, punching him. "Ye think ye can talk ta me like that, yah little prick?" he says--not in his usual French-accented English, but in the rough tones of a northern Irish accent. <br/><br/>"The only reason she's alive is because of me," says Francis.<br/><br/>"The only reason she's alive is because of <i>me</i>, buddy boy. And don't ye forget it."<br/><br/>"You kept her locked up with another werewolf, a psychopath who just wanted to mate with her."<br/><br/>"No, G\xe9vaud wouldn't do that."<br/><br/>"His body is in a basement with a silver bullet in him and his throat torn out--by Eloise!"<br/><br/>"You did this to her! Ye took away her innocence! I protected her! I kept her safe!"<br/><br/>"She wasn't safe! Her family was terrified of her--they kept her locked up, they drugged her! And your pet killed the entire village, and her family."<br/><br/>"Ye made a mistake. Ye made this personal between ye and me." He stands up again and straightens his lapels. <br/><br/>His gunsel has been watching with his mouth hanging open. "Boss? Vous n'\xeates pas fran\xe7ais?"<br/><br/>Gavigan leans in and talks softly to him. The band outside gets louder. Gavigan slides open the door. He turns back. "Oh, shamus? Catch."<br/><br/>He tosses a silenced pistol at Francis, and ducks out the door. The gunsel slowly slides down the wall, bleeding. Francis looks down at the gun that now has his fingerprints all over it. <br/><br/>Outside someone screams. He gets up and runs for the back door.<br/><br/><i>End Credits</i><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425020/#Comment_425020" name="Item_327" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-30T17:25:15+00:00" title="November 30, 2013  5:25PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>[That was the end of the session, but we all felt it deserved a post-credits sequence:]<br/><br/>INTERIOR, DAY.

We had more of the gang available for this session--while FP was still unavailable, CP did show up for the end and we introduced Henry Livingston, played by HP--part of my effort to recruit back up to something that will come close to a regular quorum. I knew that HP's schedule was wonky, so I envisioned his character starting out in the "recurring guest star" mode--and he came up with someone who it's actually plausible for that to work!<br/><br/>This episode finally wrapped up the Paris (London in the original) section of</i> Masks<i>; the group moves on to East Africa next. Also, this episode seems to have been guest-directed by Michael Bay, given the remarkable number of explosions.<br/><br/>Without further ado...]</i><br/><br/><i>Friday, 12 June 1925</i><br/><br/>With the police hard on his trail, Francis has been hiding out in the safe house he stashed Eloise, waiting for Mahoney to arrange travel papers to get out of Paris. Jimmy has been trying to track down Eloise, finding out that the last time anyone reliably saw her, she was going to the Club Hipplyte, as Hypatia has renamed Le Pyramide Bleu.<br/><br/>Down at the offices of The Nationalist, intrepid reporter--and one-time classmate of Jackson Elias--Henry Livingston is dropping by to visit Mickey Mahoney. Like Jax, Livingstone specializes in the debunking of the paranormal; he has been following up on her last story. He's heard some rumors of the "Fraternit\xe9 du Pharaon Noir", an African cult that seems to be popular with some of the upper-class members of Paris society. <br/><br/>"Mr. Livingston, I presume! I suppose you get that a lot, eh? What can I do fer ye?"<br/><br/>"I'm here looking into some cults supposed to operate in Paris. I heard that the leader of one, Tewfik al-Sayed, was recently executed."<br/><br/>"Ah, I wouldna' know anything about that. Would ye mind closin' the door?"<br/><br/>When Livingston turns back, Mahoney has a cocked pistol leveled at him. "Now, let's talk a bit more frankly. Who the hell are ye, and who sent ye?"<br/><br/>"I'm here following up on Jackson Elias's activities--"<br/><br/>"A friend of Jax? She was a dear lass. Let's drink to her. If you're looking into her murder, I can put you on the track of some others that are doin' the same. As for Tewfik, I can tell you who did that--one of her friends, Charleston Chiu. It's be better fer ye to speak to her cousin, Francis, but he's in a spot of trouble with the <i>gendarmerie</i>."<br/><br/>Mahoney advises Henry to talk to Francis's friend--colleague--well, they have a complicated relationship--Jimmy Wright. Henry heads down to the Lutetia to find Jimmy.<br/><br/>When Livingston explains he's looking into Jax's murder, Jimmy laughs for a long time, and then gives him a copy of her journal. "Welcome aboard, partner. There's a lot of occult things going on. Why, I had to deal with some werewolves a few days ago."<br/><br/>Livingston is somewhat nonplussed by that. "You don't have any evidence of that, do you?"<br/><br/>"Well, I was trying too hard to run for my life to remember to take photographs."<br/><br/>While he is sitting and talking with Livingston, a waiter tells Jimmy there's a phone call for him. "Monsieur Jimmy Wright?" says a woman's voice.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Madame Hypatia wants to see you at the Club Hipplyte tomorrow, at 10AM."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"You are looking into the disappearance of Madmoiselle Eloise Vane, oui? It will be explained tomorrow."<br/><br/>That afternoon, Francis goes to the dead drop he uses (a bottle left under a park bench) from Mahoney: "Meet me at the office tomorrow at 10 AM."<br/><br/><i>Saturday, 13 June 1925</i><br/><br/>Very early in the morning, Francis sneaks out of the safe house and makes his way up to Place R\xe9publique. He breaks into the office of Mahoney and sits there waiting to meet him.<br/><br/>Mahoney, however, doesn't arrive until 10 in the morning. "Francis? What are you doing here? Hrm, I don't remember writing that note. But come into the office."<br/><br/>Down at Club Hippolyte, Hypatia greets Jimmy and Henry. Livingston goggles for the moment--he is seeing a dead woman, one of the lost members of the Carlyle Expedition.<br/><br/>"I don't know you," says Hypatia to him. "Jimmy, right? Hah! Bet you get that a lot."<br/><br/>"I brought you some flowers."<br/><br/>"Isn't that sweet. What can I do you for?"<br/><br/>"I'm looking into the case of Eloise Vane."<br/><br/>"What makes you think that I have anything to do with that? Well, come sit down and have some coffee." They sit down and Hypatia asks one of her staff to fetch their drinks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"I'm tellin' ye, I didn't write that note," says Mahoney as he sits down behind his desk. He starts to open the drawer where he keeps his whiskey bottle. Francis hears a faint clicking sound. He grabs Mahoney's wrist before he can pull back the drawer.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble by FP. I lowered the difficulty in keeping with ToC's theory on important rolls being easier.]</i><br/><br/>"What's wrong?" says Mahoney.<br/><br/>"I heard a click."<br/><br/>Mahoney's face drains of blood. "Francis, why don't you look in the drawer and tell me what you see."<br/><br/>Francis shines his penlight into the drawer. A dynamite bomb is strapped to the underside of it. <br/><br/>"Francis, me boy, I know that when we built these with a spring timer we always put in a backup chemical timer." Francis checks and sees the ruptured glass vial that holds the chemicals used to start the reaction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Livingston listens with one ear as Hypatia and Jimmy talk. He keeps watching the kitchen door--he hasn't seen the waiter who took their order. Or anyone else from the staff, come to think of it. He excuses himself and heads for the kitchen.<br/><br/>"Find out where that coffee is," says Hypatia.<br/><br/>The kitchen is deserted. Henry pokes around and soon finds the dynamite bombs--several of them--fastened under the kitchen counters. There are enough to bring down the entire building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Is there anyone you want me to talk to?" asks Francis quietly.<br/><br/>"Yeah, me daughter in Dublin," whispers Mahoney. "Tell her--tell her I died a soldier."<br/><br/>Francis starts to leave. "Wait," says Mahoney. "Light me a cigar. And godspeed."<br/><br/>After Francis leaves, Mahoney begins to sing softly. <br/><br/><i>Soldiers are we,<br/>whose lives are pledged to Ireland...</i><br/><br/>Francis runs into the main office. "GET OUT! BOMB!" he shouts. The "reporters" grab their pistols and head for the front door. <br/><br/><i>Some have come<br/>from a land beyond the wave...</i><br/><br/>Francis notices that the street has been blocked off by a road crew outside--a crew that takes out sawed-off shotguns as soon as he steps outside.<br/><br/><i>Sworn to be free,<br/>no more our ancient sireland,<br/>Shall shelter the despot or the slave.</i><br/><br/>Francis draws his heavy Colt revolver and starts firing. He shoots the biggest member of the "road crew." The "reporters" start firing as well.<br/><br/><i>Too bad I never learned the damn thing in Gaelic,</i> thinks Mahoney, puffing on his cigar. <i>Too late now.</i> He continues to sing.<br/><br/><i>Tonight we man the "bearna baoil",<br/>In Erin\u2019s cause, come woe or weal...</i><br/><br/>The big man fires off his shotgun, winging Francis. As he reloads, Francis runs up and drop kicks him. The big man goes down and smacks his head against the curb. <br/><br/><i>\u2019Mid cannon\u2019s roar and rifles\u2019 peal,<br/>We\u2019ll chant a soldier's song...</i><br/><br/>With a thunderous roar, the building explodes behind Francis, flattening him to the pavement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Livingston examines the bombs. He notes that they have both a timer and a radio-controlled detonator; it's highly sophisticated work. He checks how much time is left on the timer.<br/><br/><i>45 seconds.</i><br/><br/>Livingston bolts out of the kitchen. "RUN!"<br/><br/>"I think we should run," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"My girls!" says Hypatia. "They're upstairs!"<br/><br/>"Damnit, damnit, damnit," says Jimmy, following Hypatia up the stairs. She throws open a door into a room rigged as some kind of dormitory. Several young girls start at the sight of Jimmy bursting in the doorway. "GET OUT!" he screams. He leads the girls downstairs as fast as he can, shoving them out the door. The last girl slips out, slamming the door behind her. Jimmy pushes on it.<br/><br/>It's locked in place.<br/><br/>He turns to Hypatia. "Aren't you--can't you--DO SOMETHING!"<br/><br/>"It doesn't work like--"<br/><br/>And the entire building falls on top of them in a blinding flash of noise and light.<br/><br/><i>[Sweet of Jimmy to help Hypatia, but his Bad Luck caused him to get caught in the blast--1d6+4, which I made JP roll because I am mean. (It was lower because he was no longer at point blank range to it.) Jimmy took 8 pts of damage, which left him barely conscious.]</i><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425069/#Comment_425069" name="Item_331" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T14:32:34+00:00" title="December  2, 2013  2:32PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode X: Et l'oc\xe9an de l'oubli brisant nos c\u0153urs et nos t\xeates (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>Livingston is knocked to the ground. He stands up, ears ringing, a huge cloud of dust and smoke enveloping him. Fires burn in the buildings around him.<br/><br/>Jimmy pushes off some rubble and weakly stands up. The doorway he was standing in managed to protect him from the worst of the damage. Some firefighters drag him away from the rubble, and he eventually is questioned by the police at the hospital.<br/><br/>No body matching Hypatia's description is ever found in the rubble.<br/><br/>Livingston makes his way over to the gaggle of reporters covering the explosion. "Unbelievable," says one. "Three explosions in one day."<br/><br/>"<i>Three</i> explosions?"<br/><br/>"Yeah, some newspaper office up in the Tenth and the Fondation Aubrey Penhew. They blew up too."<br/><br/>"Do you know anything about it?"<br/><br/>"Well, some crazy English guy threatened Gavigan, the head of the Foundation, and since an Irish newspaper got destroyed, it was probably the perfidious British. Luckily Gavigan is fine--he's traveling in Italy."<br/><br/><br/><br/>That evening Jimmy staggers into his room at the Lutetia. Francis is standing by the window, covered in plaster and blood, staring out at the street. He uncocks the shotgun when he notices Jimmy coming in.<br/><br/>"How was your day?" asks Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Mahoney's dead."<br/><br/>"The Blue Pyramid got blown up too. While I was in it!"<br/><br/>"It's got to be Gavigan. He's a bomber. He probably left town, do you know anyone who could track him?"<br/><br/>"I met this reporter, he knows about the occult--"<br/><br/>"That does NOT mean we can trust him!"<br/><br/>"He knew Jax."<br/><br/>"Fine, get him down here. We're going to Italy. Tell your friend to meet us at Orly."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy sneaks down to the ruins of the Fondation Aubrey Penhew. He manages to talk his way past some cops and climbs down into the crater. Searching near where Gavigan's office used to be, he finds a charred piece of paper with groups of letters on it:\n<p><br/>EEMK \tBGFK \tAIDA     DAHK \t<br/>IFAL \t        KKFA \t        ABFD     EJFC \t<br/>FBEJ \tMAIF \tFMJK     AMFK \t<br/>HAHJ \tDDAA \tGJHA     JDDD \t<br/>DAGE \tDAHA \tDIGL     FGFC<br/></p>\nJimmy's shoulders slump. It looks like a message encrypted with a one-time pad; it should be unbreakable without the key. He also remembers that Sprech, the man he met at Castle Plum, was a cryptographer.<br/><br/><i>[Cop Talk to get into the crime scene, Evidence Collection to find the paper, Cryptography to recognize how the message was constructed. This was a bit off-the-cuff for me--I had nothing planned out--but I had been thinking about how the Conspiracy communicates with each other and had decided on one-time pads as the most likely answer.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Livingston meets Jimmy and Francis at Orly Airfield. Santi-Exup\xe9ry meets Henry at the entrance of the Pilot's Club. "Are you looking for Madmoiselle Summers? She is a bit under the weather..."<br/><br/>A bottle slams against the wall. Joyce staggers into view, completely plastered. "I can't believe he's dead! Who will charter me now? I was making good money running guns and alcohol for Mahoney!"<br/><br/>Francis and Jimmy both look away and try to act nonchalant.<br/><br/>"I can help out," says Henry. "I'm a pilot myself--"<br/><br/>"Nobody flies my plane!" says Joyce, and then passes out.<br/><br/>They carry her to the plane and Henry takes the controls as "co-pilot". They manage to get off the ground, and then he keeps them on heading for Dublin, touching down in more-or-less one piece early the next morning. Henry barely gets a chance to meet the rest of the Motley Crew--Dr. Mwimbe, Charleston and Noor.<br/><br/>In Dublin, Francis drops in on Faith Mahoney. <br/><br/>"I haven't spoken with me father for goin' on four-five years now."<br/><br/>"I was there at his last moments. He wanted you to know he died a soldier."<br/><br/>"Shouldna been a soldier," says Faith, shaking her head. "Pray take some tea with me."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Before they leave Ireland, Joyce has pontoon skids mounted on her plane.

Francis has managed to fill out (or forge) the paperwork to not only admit them to Italy, but authorize the rather large number of guns they are bringing into the country. ("Of course, Signor. A Browning Automatic Rifle is often required to hunt hippos.") Fortunately, Fascist bureaucracies do enjoy paperwork.<br/><br/><i>[Bureaucracy spend by OP. I went and fetched my map of Venice from my last trip there at this point.]</i><br/><br/>After docking the plane, they take a quick vaporetto trip to St. Mark's square and locate a modest <i>penzione</i> to lay low in. "You guys need to come up with a plan that doesn't involve me bludgeoning my way through Venice to get to Gavigan," advises Francis; he's a two-fisted investigator, not a drawing-room detective.<br/><br/>Henry hits the streets--er, canals. He looks up another reporter he knows, Michelangelo Simonetti. Francis drops by on the Carabinieri, to see if they have heard of Gavigan. They tell him that he is a frequent visitor, and has a place "out in the lagoon". Jimmy does what he does best--go out and meet random people, with an uncanny ability to find the right people to talk with.<br/><br/><i>[Streetwise--er, Canalwise for HP to have a contact who would be useful; Cop Talk--er, Carabinieri Parlare by OP to meet the cops, and Oral History for JP.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy ends up falling in with some gondolieri who tell him that Gavigan has his own personal water taxi. None of them like his pilot--an Austrian named G\xfcnter, who is pretty stand-offish. They easily give him a description, however. They also say he holds large parties every couple of months, and G\xfcnter transports large groups of people out to the lagoon during that time.<br/><br/>Simonetti is the crime reporter for the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> newspaper. "Enrico, <i>come va</i>? You find any ghosts under the bed yet? What are you doing in Venezia?"<br/><br/>"Everything confirms my belief in reality so far. I'm looking into the death of Jackson Elias. Do you know anything about an Edouard Gavigan?"<br/><br/>"Ah, yes, I heard about the death of Signorina Elias. As for Signor Eduardo, he just got back a few days ago. He doesn't come to the city that often. He has a private villa on the island of Torcello. Used to be a big deal fifteen hundred years ago, before the canals silted up and the Huns came. Anyway, he lands in a plane and heads straight out there, but I can take a look into things if it would help."<br/><br/><i>[Real place, real history--Torcello was the major settlement in the lagoon until the events related above happened. I'm developing a lost city theme here. I pulled up a satellite image of the island on my tablet at this point.]</i><br/><br/>They decide that they need to 1) scout out the island and 2) follow G\xfcnter around for a day. Francis drops by Jimmy's gondolieri contacts to pick up on G\xfcnter's trail, while Henry and Jimmy rent a boat for some sightseeing. Francis also hits on a plan to track down Gavigan's alcohol suppliers, to see if he can find any patterns or other connections. <br/><br/><i>[Accounting spend by OP.]</i><br/><br/><i>Friday, 19 June 1925</i><br/><br/>The charter floats off the island of Torcello's northwest coast. Jimmy gives the captain orders to "float casually." Henry snaps photographs from the stern. He can make out a large, boxy villa set back from the shore in a grove of trees. Men armed with shotguns and teams of dogs patrol the beach. <br/><br/>They swing around the island and make a landing to the east of the villa. They scout up ahead, trying to find a covered route to the main house. Through the trees, Henry can just make out an Egyptian obelisk behind it.<br/><br/>Francis finds out that G\xfcnter lives on the island, but he does come into Venice to buy supplies--Gavigan orders a lot of booze from Harry Cipriani's. He finds out that large orders for alcohol and food have been placed for delivery in the next day or two. It seems that a party is imminent.<br/><br/>Francis spends the rest of the morning going from apothecary to apothecary getting large doses of arsenic, strychnine, and cyanide.<br/><br/><i>[Streetwise + Reassurance + Medical + 1 point Pharmacy spend. Then OP began to talk about possibly poisoning the wine deliveries. Sigh. PCs and mass murder, amirite?]</i><br/><br/>In the afternoon G\xfcnter finally arrives. Francis, waiting at a gondolieri caf\xe9, catches sight of him. He trails the Austrian as he drops in on several stores, arranging deliveries and picking up supplies. At one point, Francis overhears G\xfcnter mentioning that he will be making several runs out to the mainland that night to bring people to the island.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425351/#Comment_425351" name="Item_337" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T18:56:30+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  6:56PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2013 7:49PM by Aviatrix.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode X: Et l'oc\xe9an de l'oubli brisant nos c\u0153urs et nos t\xeates (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Back on Torcello, Henry and Jimmy continue to scout. They can only get so close to the villa--at a certain point, there's nothing but open ground (surprise!) and Jimmy is pretty sure that he can see people in the second story watching the tree line at all times. They notice an electrical generator attached to the house, providing its power. Henry catches a better look at the obelisk--it is on a slight hill, and surrounded by a broad open plain. Based on the pattern of growth of the grass around the obelisk, Henry guesses that larger groups of people gather there fairly regularly.<br/><br/>Then he catches sight of the bones--piles of bones at the base of the obelisk. They look vaguely human.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, look at the bones!" he says.<br/><br/><i>[The bones are only observable via Outdoorsman. Jimmy doesn't have that, so he shouldn't normally have to make a Stability check--but his Bad Luck meant that Henry pointed it out to him.<br/><br/>Henry was somehow at 0 Stability by this point, so he narrated the story of his hat (his Symbol) which was worth a 2-point refresh.]</i><br/><br/>They watch for a while and get a rough count of the number of guards at the villa--somewhere between 8 and 12, all armed with rifles or shotguns--not double-barreled hunting guns, but good old M1912 "Trench Cleaner" pump actions. Many have sidearms as well.<br/><br/><i>[They could have gotten a basic layout of the villa with Architecture--for those of you playing at home, that's the "find secret doors" skill--but neither of them had it.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>The entire group reconvenes at the <i>penzione</i>. "Here's my plan," says Francis. "I hope someone has a better one.<br/><br/>"A frontal assault seems impossible. But there's a party tomorrow. I've acquired a large amount of poison."<br/><br/>Jimmy stares at Francis, mouth agape.<br/><br/>"The only way we can get to Gaffigan is by poisoning the wine," continues Francis.<br/><br/>"I'm not poisoning an entire party," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"That's all right, provided you have a better idea. Gaffigan attacked us personally, and Hypatia--who is not innocent by any means--did not deserve this."<br/><br/><i>[Francis is overprotective towards women.]</i><br/><br/>Everyone is lost in their own thoughts for a while, digesting what Francis had said. Jimmy clutches his rabbit's foot, asking it--as he usually does in times of stress--for any insight. The rabbit's foot, however, tells him what it always tells him: "Jimmy, you're the rest of the rabbit."<br/><br/>Henry wonders if he should tell the rest of the group that while they were in the hotel in Ireland, one night he heard Dr. Mwimbe sobbing her eyes out in her room. He hesitates--he doesn't know them or the doctor very well.<br/><br/>Francis steps out onto the balcony and smokes a cigarette. He swigs down the last of the Jameson he brought with him from Ireland. He looks down at his lighter, lost in his memories.<br/><br/><i>[JP and OP took their Symbol refreshes here.]</i><br/><br/>They begin to discuss the plans. Jimmy is adamantly against poisoning <i>everybody</i>, but seems to think it might be possible to target Gavigan specifically. Henry is willing to entertain all ideas. Suddenly, he recalls a detail about the obelisk that gives him pause--Egyptian obelisks didn't normally have iron rings driven into them.<br/><br/>"I think we're better off not stepping foot on the island at all," he says.<br/><br/><i>[Hard Driver time, though, for Henry--Thirst for Knowledge and an occult reporter with his first evidence of the occult? Yeah, he had to go, and picked up 2 points of Stability.]</i><br/><br/>They begin to put together a plan. Gavigan doesn't know Henry at all, so he could possibly be inserted into the party staff--he speaks French, so sommelier suggests itself. However, he doesn't know much about wine.<br/><br/><i>[CR 3 for Henry. He doesn't know wines.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy tries to teach Henry a few basics, but it's been a long time since he dined that well. Francis thinks for a while, and then decides to go pick up the <i>actual</i> sommelier.<br/><br/><i>[I thought with Streetwise he might go to the laundry or a tailor, but instead OP decided to go after the actual employee!]</i><br/><br/>Gavigan has a regular wine butler for his villa, but for a party this big he hires a sommelier. Francis goes looking for him.<br/><br/>Jimmy heads down to the carabinieri. With his usual luck, he finds the right guy right away--the detective who handles the cold cases and unsolvable murders. Specifically, the ones where a dead Arab girl occasionally washes up on shore. Jimmy realizes that this is where all the girls taken from Le Pyramide Bleu have been taken, and that Plan C (dropping a bomb on the villa) will probably kill a bunch of innocents. (And poisoning the wine might do so as well, if the cultists get the girls drunk.)<br/><br/><i>Saturday, 20 June 1925<br/><br/>The night before the New Moon</i><br/><br/>At lunch, Francis finally spots someone who could be his target--an elegantly dressed man who speaks Italian with a French accent. When he angrily sends away a bottle of wine, he knows he's got his man.<br/><br/>Francis plops down across from him and rips away his copy of <i>La Prenza</i>.<br/><br/>"<i>Come va,</i>" says the man, angrily. Francis refuses to respond. "<i>Tu veut quelque chose?</i> You want something, mac?"<br/><br/>"You're going to call in sick tonight."<br/><br/>"I don't know what you're talking about."<br/><br/>"That's fine. It's not in your interest to go. Your life is not worth even that much money."<br/><br/>"What are you saying? Are you threatening my life?"<br/><br/>"What do you <i>think</i> I'm doing?"<br/><br/><i>[1-pt Intimidation spend.]</i><br/><br/>Of course, Francis knows he's actually <i>saving</i> the guy's life in all likelihood. He shows the sommelier some stories about the Blue Pyramid and some pictures of the obelisk. The Frenchman agrees not to go, helped by Francis packing his bags for him. <br/><br/>Together, they return to the <i>penzione</i>. Jimmy calls in a tailor to alter Claude the sommelier's suit for Henry's frame, and Francis brings in a shady engraver to make a copy of Claude's invitation for Charleston, who has decided to infiltrate the party as a cultist.

Charleston and Henry will infiltrate the party, while Francis and Jimmy will do a commando-style raid on the house. They'll use Joyce and her plane to evacuate anyone they find from the island. Jimmy prepares a disguise for Charleston, making him look older, and they dress him in one of the several yellow robes they have acquired between Cairo and Paris.<br/><br/>Henry receives a crash course in wine from Claude the sommelier, and then dresses in the summer formal white jacket. <br/><br/>They work out a signal between Charleston and Henry--if Henry calls out for the "wines of Castemere", that will be Charleston's signal to start killing. As a backup, they give Henry fake glasses so that if Charleston can't hear him, Henry will put on the glasses.<br/><br/>Henry meets G\xfcnter at 4 pm. He has his credentials checked, and then boards the boat for Torcello along with the rest of the servants. While Charleston--er, "Master Pan"--waits for his turn to be ferried out to the island, Francis and Jimmy take their chartered boat out to the east coast of Torcello and begin sneaking cross country.<br/><br/>Henry mills about on the villa grounds once he arrives. A large banquet is being set on tables outside. Summoning up as much aplomb as he can muster, he gives orders for the wine. He sees some girls being led out of the villa and then chained to the obelisk.<br/><br/>"Don't worry," says a goon. "This is all part of the show. They're dancers."<br/><br/>Around 5:30, Charleston meets the water taxi for his trip to the island. A surprisingly well-heeled crowd is shuffling on board, including several Chinese gentlemen. When he gets to the island, he finds a place to sit and drink some wine. He notices people wheeling out five machines that vaguely resemble spotlights. Supervising their installation is Henry Clive.<br/><br/>Gavigan finds Henry. "Claude, yes? Didn't I meet you in Paris?"<br/><br/>"Possibly."<br/><br/>"Anyway, I need something dry for the Italians, something sweet for the Germans, and I don't know what the Chinese are drinking. But this is important--for my personal table, only these three bottles. You have no discretion in that, understand?"<br/><br/>"Oui, monsieur."<br/><br/>"Good. There will be something extra in your envelope at the end of the night."<br/><br/>Meanwhile Francis and Jimmy manage to sneak up to the house, using the chaos of the party to sneak past the guards. As they approach the villa, they hear the sound of horns blowing--something like a shofar.<br/><br/>The partygoers make their way to gather around the obelisk. At that point, the strange machines begin to project eerie green beams in the air, which converge at a point above the obelisk. Charleston studies the projectors and the point they converge on--it's some kind of portal, but it seems somehow different than other portals he's studied.<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos spend by CP. I let him choose how much Stability he wanted to lose--he went for a 3-point loss, so I told him not only was it a portal, but that it was different. Had he gone for the full 4-point loss, I would have told him it opened up a direct line to Azathoth.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston also notices that some of the engravings on the obelisk and the various decorations seem to resemble some of the signs he saw in the temple of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue in New York.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy and Francis easily bypass the locks on the villa doors. They enter the great hall of the building and begin to look for a way to the basement. Jimmy recalls Gavigan's predilection for secret rooms, so together they search the fireplace. Francis finds a passageway down to a "panic room", a secret chamber with no exit.<br/><br/>Jimmy finds a stairway leading down to a corridor lined with cells. At the far end is another room that looks like some kind of workroom. Five girls are being held in the cells. <br/><br/>"Shhhh," whispers Francis as he works on the unlocking the cells.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gavigan begins to give a speech. "We must remember our losses this year," he says. "Omar Shakhti. Tewfik al-Sayed..."<br/><br/>The Arabic contingent looks annoyed at the mention of their fallen leaders.<br/><br/>Henry pours some wine into a decanter and adds some poison to it. He hands Gavigan a glass, who holds it idly in one hand. He looks around at the extremely rich and important people gathered at his table. He nods at them and they drink a toast to him--from the special three bottles he specifically ordered Henry to use.<br/><br/>Then they all drop dead, except for Gavigan. "Au revoir, mes amis," he says. He seems to notice the glass in his hands.<br/><br/>Gavigan raises his glass. Henry begins to sweat slightly. For a second the rim of the glass touches his lips. Henry holds his breath. Gavigan is about to drink. His face darkens. He sniffs the glass.<br/><br/>Then he stares at Henry. He makes a quick hand sign and some guards begin to make their way towards Henry.<br/><br/><i>[It was a Filch test to successfully switch out Gavigan's glass for one with poison in it. The TN was 6. HP spent both his Filch points and rolled a 3, for a 5 total--so close.

"That was not quite the right wine. Bring out the red wines of Castamere!"<br/><br/>Gavigan shouts in Aklo at his goons--Charleston understands him, but almost nobody else. "Kill the sacrifices, prevent anyone else from leaving."<br/><br/>Several men draw out knives and advance on the girls chained to the obelisk. Two men with shotguns head towards Henry. The crowd begins to mill about. Henry pounces on one of the men with the shotgun and tries to wrestle the gun out of his hands.<br/><br/><i>["Two people, one gun" is the rule here--a Scuffling contest for control of the gun. I don't love this rule--contests eat points at a hideous rate; I'm thinking of house ruling it as a one-round zero sum contest.]</i><br/><br/>The gunsel snarls and rips the gun from Henry's grasp and then smashes the butt of the gun into his face.<br/><br/>Charleston raises his hands and begins to chant in Aklo. Nothing happens for a while. Back in the penzione, Noor watches Charleston's gun raise out of its violin case and begin to assemble itself as it sails out of the window.<br/><br/>"Already?" she says to herself. "It's not even 6:30."<br/><br/>The gun sails several miles across the water before slipping into--over--what the hell is it doing to Charleston's arm?<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the basement of the villa, Francis begins to lead the girls up to the surface. He hands a flask of absinthe to Jimmy. "Go burn everything down here," he says.<br/><br/>Jimmy runs down the hallway and enters Gavigan's work room--a bigger and grander version of the secret room he had found under the Fondation headquarters in Paris. Hideous paintings hang from the wall, and arcane symbols are carved into the floor. Weird chemical and alchemical devices fill several large tables.<br/><br/>On a desk in the corner of the room, Jimmy finds a fat ledger book that he slips into his satchel. He also finds a very small book, printed on flash paper, filled with groups of seemingly random letters. He sucks his breath--this must be the one-time pad codebook!<br/><br/>He grabs the little book and then splashes alcohol on everything in reach. He sets a fire and retreats up the hall, confident that it will take a while for the fire to catch. So he is somewhat surprised when a fireball from the room behind him knocks him flat in the hallway, which quickly is engulfed in flames.<br/><br/><i>[Jimmy's Bad Luck hits here--the room was filled with weird chemical vapors, and lit up much faster than he expected.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>The stock of the Tommy gun has transformed into tentacles that wrap around Charleston's arm. Instead of a 50-shot drum, it has a pulsating blue egg sack. When he fires the gun, it shoots tiny eggs into its targets--eggs that immediately hatch into hideous little tentacled arachnids.<br/><br/><i>[This was all CP--he built off me reminding him that he hasn't yet listened to Cthulhu--you know, the guy he sold his soul to--and so he spun up this truly horrifying description of his gun. I was left wondering if his own Source of Stability could itself provoke a Stability check.]</i><br/><br/>"I forgot to feed it!" says Charleston, apologetically. "I never had a pet before!" <br/><br/>By "feeding" he means that he has to kill an indiscriminate number of people, of course.<br/><br/>Henry barely has time to get to his feet when he sees the five girls chained to the obelisk get their throats cut by Gavigan's men. Then as Charleston begins to fire at random into the crowd, he and the gunsels hit the deck.<br/><br/>Francis and Jimmy manage to run out of the villa, which is now completely engulfed in fire. Men with guns converge on their position. Francis runs at them, leaps up, and spins around, firing at one of thugs with his pistol. As he rotates, his trenchcoat whirling open, he draws his sawed-off shotgun and fires both barrels at another thug. He lands on one knee, doves unaccountably fluttering around him, glowing pink in the dying light of sunset.<br/><br/>Then the villa explodes behind him.<br/><br/><i>[Special guest director: John Woo.<br/><br/>OP came up with the move, and we all got into the HK spirit on it.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Something begins to come through the portal. Henry decides that discretion is definitely the better part of valor and tries to take off. He has just reached the edge of the clearing when a crowd of people bowl him over. He watches an elephant-sized, insectoid, featherless <i>bird</i> creature flap through the portal and into the sky, screeching horribly, accompanied by a hideous stench.<br/><br/><i>[TN 6 Fleeing check; Henry just missed it. Tant pis--wasn't his day.

The two of them feed on the corpses of the girls. <br/><br/>Charleston looks around for Gavigan, and spots him running towards a boat waiting on the beach, with Clive in tow. He also notices that the people Gavigan had poisoned have begun to get up and chase the still-living members of the party. Much worse, the people that they bite to death tend to get up themselves and begin to chase anyone living nearby.<br/><br/><i>[Gavigan was working on apocalypse zombies.]</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425645/#Comment_425645" name="Item_340" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-10T21:17:23+00:00" title="December 10, 2013  9:17PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2013 9:18PM by Aviatrix.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode X: Et l'oc\xe9an de l'oubli brisant nos c\u0153urs et nos t\xeates (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>Francis and Jimmy reach the other side of the island along with the five girls they rescued. As Joyce taxis the Fokker in towards shore, Francis fires off a flare to signal for their charter boat to come in to pick the rest of them up. He tells Jimmy to take the girls aboard the plane, and soon it soars into the darkening sky.<br/><br/>An elephant-sized flying creature flaps grotesquely into the air to intercept the plane.<br/><br/>"What the fu--" says Joyce. Stunned at the appearance of the Shantak, she goes limp. The plane begins to dip. Jimmy races to the cockpit.<br/><br/>"You've got to snap out of it!" he says. "Remember, uh, booze--and lady friends--and you've got to get home to get them! So fly the plane!"<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by JP. Since this is Joyce-as-a-NPC, she has mundane Stability--probably about 4--but I often don't even roll for NPCs in a situation like this. She got stunned by the Mythos shock.]</i><br/><br/>"Right, right," mutters Joyce. She pulls back on the stick and the plane begins to climb again. But the Shantak keeps pace, shrieking as it follows the plane higher.<br/><br/>Jimmy races to the back of the plane. "Dump some fuel!" he shouts at Joyce.<br/><br/>"Not sure that's a great idea, but..." She hits the emergency fuel release.<br/><br/>Jimmy opens the door on the side of the cabin. For the first time he gets a good look at the monster, and he screams long and loud at it.<br/><br/><br/>"This is not reality!" shouts Henry. "Not reality!"<br/><br/><i>[Henry is based on Sam Neill's character from "In the Mouth of Madness".]</i><br/><br/>He and Charleston eventually rendezvous with Francis and wade out to the boat. They begin to motor across the lagoon, watching the Shantak chasing the plane.<br/><br/>"That looks like our plane!" says Charleston.<br/><br/>"It <i>is</i> our plane!" says Francis. "Jimmy and the girls are on it!"<br/><br/>Charleston considers casting the Hoy-Dhin chant, but remembers that Shantaks fly through the void of interstellar space and so can't be suffocated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy, ever practical, stops screaming and rummages in the crate of guns that Francis bought in Ireland. He pulls out a Browning Automatic Rifle and rests it against the door frame.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll by JP]</i><br/><br/>He pulls the trigger and runs out the entire magazine in a single long burst. Bullets rip into the creature; many bounce off its tough hide, but a few manage to hit the eyes and beak, enraging it. It springs forward, diving into the spray of fuel.<br/><br/>One wing reaches out and smashes into the tail of the plane--<br/><br/>                              As Jimmy calmly drops the BAR--<br/><br/>--the plane begins to tumble and then drop into a steep dive--<br/><br/>                               --and draws a flare gun from his coat--<br/><br/>--the girls scream as the plane begins to drop. The Shantak shrieks and juts its head forward--<br/><br/>                              --as Jimmy loads the flare and fires it at the creature--<br/><br/>--the explosion lights up the sky. The Shantak howls in pain and confusion and turns away--<br/><br/>                              --as Jimmy drops the flare gun and pulls the door shut--<br/><br/>"Brace for--" says Joyce. The plane smashes nose first into the water before she can finish. Jimmy sails down the length of the plane and smashes into a bulkhead.<br/><br/><i>[JP had some very lucky damage rolls here--the BAR actually did damage to the shantak, which isn't easy (it has very high armor.) The fuel-air explosion also did close to max damage. His bad luck hit here again, though--I said that Jimmy could either brace himself for the crash, or close the door. The former would have kept him from taking damage, but flooded the plane and killed Joyce and probably most or all of the girls. Jimmy decided to take the damage. He's a Big Damn Hero.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis guides the boat towards the crash. Burning oil floats on the water. The plane has settled a bit by the nose, exposing the tail and the rear hatch. Charleston leaps out of the boat, jumping from bit of wreckage to piece of flotsam, and nimbly hops up onto the plane. He throws open the hatch. Henry and Francis follow, picking their way through the wreckage.<br/><br/>Jimmy dives under water and swims into the cockpit. He cuts Joyce free from her seat belt and then hauls her back into the tail. Francis and Charleston pull them out into the water and start ferrying them back to the plane. Francis pushes through burning oil, shoving wreckage out of his way as he personally carries three girls to safety. He flops back into the boat when he is done, completely exhausted.<br/><br/><i>[Francis has a low Athletics score--he had to piggyback on Charleston's roll to get over to the plane. To take a girl back to their boat was a one point spend per girl; this would have made it difficult for Francis to swim back to the boat himself. FP asked if he could spend Health instead, and I agreed, at a 3-to-1 ratio. He spent 9 points, going to 0 Health.]</i><br/><br/>Henry and Charleston begin to swim back to the plane, but the oil and flames disorient him. Henry panics--he's exhausted and can barely swim--and the two of them begin to slip under the waves.<br/><br/><i>[Henry was out of Athletics, which caused the piggyback check TN to go to 5; Charleston failed and they began to drown. Both took damage the first round of drowning.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston makes a supreme effort and makes it back to the surface. He rolls out of the water and into the boat, then reaches down and pulls Henry in behind him. As the boat races away towards the mainland, riding about a foot above the water, the plane explodes behind them.<br/><br/><i>[Special guest director: Michael Bay.

What is his plan, again? Mind, if Hypatia survived the blast, I'm not sure who I'd bet on in a war.<br/><br/>The chemical back up is / was a real thing?</blockquote>\nThis was, more or less, Gavigan's master plan:<br/><br/>He knew that he was at a bit of a disadvantage in the Conspiracy--not a sorcerer, and probably never going to be able to advance beyond where he is now. He knows the other factions are maneuvering to come out on top if and when The Big N's master plan kicks off.<br/><br/>What he decided to do was take the existing "magical technology" he had access to in order to produce a Doomsday Weapon--something he could hold over the rest of the conspiracy, some weapon so terrible that he could win just by threatening to use it.<br/><br/>What he went for was Apocalypse Zombies. Zombies have already been shown to exist, but only via a long enchantment process. But Gavigan had access to a werewolf or two; so what he was looking for was a way to cross the contagiousness of lycanthropy with undead animation. This was why he kept such a tight lock on Eloise, and why he dispatched sorcerers to study/sample her.<br/><br/>Of course, being Gavigan, he had another line running through this. By using Eloise to create the mystic apocalypse zombie contagion, his plan was to imprint the zombies created with a willingness to follow/obey/love him. Sympathetic magic and all that. He was also working on "suicider" strains that would "die" after a certain period of time.<br/><br/>This was hinted at in places. The thing in the box that Jimmy encountered was an apocalypse zombie prototype. There was his interest (beyond his love for her, of course) in Eloise. Had the PCs been more intrigued, they could have found more of this out.<br/><br/>The opening of the gate on Torcello was both a rehearsal for the main event and the necessary catalyst to finally kick off the apocalypse zombie tests. After that demonstration, he could show the rest of the Conspiracy what he was capable of.<br/><br/>Hypatia's return was a major threat to all this; he rightly assumed that her presence in Paris was a direct threat to him, and she certainly was moving fast. She had begun to recruit her Amazon corps to be her fanatically loyal followers, and she was muscling in to pick up the cultists left in limbo by the death of Tewfik. Of course, from Gavigan's perspective, the PCs sure looked like they were pawns of Hypatia aimed at him, no matter what the other members of the Conspiracy told him. This finally provoked him to take them all out in a single stroke--this was mostly clinched by his confrontation with Francis, but Gavigan is never afraid of the bold move.<br/><br/>As for chemical timers, they are indeed one way to set a time bomb--during WWII the British used them extensively as a way to smuggle bombs into places where mechanical timers would be noticed or inconvenient. (The bomb used in the attempt on Hitler's life was of this type--they wanted to avoid any ticking noise.) While I don't know much about bombmaking, it seemed reasonable to me that a belt-and-suspenders guy like Gavigan would want to make sure that even if the mechanical trigger was blocked, the bomb would still go off.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425801/#Comment_425801" name="Item_343" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-14T15:55:51+00:00" title="December 14, 2013  3:55PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool -- I wasn't sure whether the chemical thing was fact or fiction.

For this one, I decided to try a few new things.<br/><br/>First, even more than the other playsets, I wanted to generate ties to Jackson Elias. With that in mind, I already had my subject--Jax's last birthday party in New York City, shortly before she left for Africa. Then, to strengthen that even further, I made all the locations have to do with her--and I added a bit of a twist.<br/><br/>You see, while each location was tied to a specific place, over half of them were tied as well to a specific </i>time<i>--each of the temporal locations was an incident in Jax's life. I've included notes on the PDF to explain what each of them meant.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever seen that in a playset before, so hey Jason Morningstar, if you read this thread have a look! Unfortunately, it makes the playset really tied to my own work (it actually included the specific backstories of several PCs), but feel free to hack the idea if you want. I mean, I guess if you ever wanted to follow in my footsteps and run your own version of my hack...well, for God's sake, stop! This thing is driving </i>me<i> to distraction :-)<br/><br/>I don't have my notes on the playset setup handy, so I'll do the locations &amp; relationships from memory and fix them when I can. I asked that we stick to only setting scenes in the locations chosen, and we did except for some stuff FP put in.<br/><br/><b>Jimmy--Fritz</b>: Novelist and biggest fan<br/><br/><b>Jimmy--Francis</b>: Private Eyes (natch)<br/><br/><b>Francis--Fritz</b>: Snitches<br/><br/><b>Jax--Fritz</b>: Shared accommodations for a while<br/><br/>The locations:<br/><br/><b>Jonah Kensington's Apartment</b>: Site of the party, July 1924<br/><br/><b>The White Star Line Pier</b> July, 1924.

The White Star Lines Pier</i><br/><br/>As Fritz Krakauer, author, steps onto the pier, catches sight of Freddie Blakely, whom he had known briefly while in England.<br/><br/>"What ho, Felix! Haven't seen you since that night I saw you and Alma, and those two other fellows...are you still so flexible?"<br/><br/>"Not really. It is good to see you."<br/><br/>"I suppose I'm here to take you to the party."<br/><br/>As they get into a cab and head towards Washington Square, Franz tries to hunch down in the seat.<br/><br/><i>Jonah's Apartment, Washington Square. July, 1924</i><br/><br/>Jimmy steps into the crowded apartment, full of smoke and stuffed with people. Booze is everywhere. <br/><br/>A woman in a white dress pushes her way through the crowd to him. "Jimmy! I'm so happy you came!"<br/><br/>"Jax! Happy birthday!"<br/><br/>"Thank you, Jimmy." She leads him into a less noisy part of the room. "Were you able to look into that stuff on the Carlyle expedition I asked you to check out for me?"<br/><br/>"Uh, Definitely. You know me!"<br/><br/>He hands over a rather thin folder.<br/><br/>"Oh," says Jax as she scans the contents. "I was hoping you'd be able to get the psychiatrist's files on Carlyle."<br/><br/>"Well, you know how psychiatrists are...confidentiality and all that..."<br/><br/>"Yeah, but they're all dead, right? So who cares? I thought you were a pretty persuasive guy, Jimmy."<br/><br/>"Ah...yeah...sorry...am I supposed to mingle?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Jimmy, you're supposed to mingle. I think that Francis is here."<br/><br/>At that moment Fritz Krakauer enters the apartment. He looks around nervously and soon comes face to face with Jackson and Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Jimmy Wright."<br/><br/>"Fritz Krakauer."<br/><br/>Jimmy boggles. "Are you the one--who wrote that--I'm your biggest fan! I loved that book you wrote!"<br/><br/>"I dunno," says Jax. "I thought it was a little derivative of Kafka."<br/><br/>"Nein! Not Kafka! It was all mine!"<br/><br/>"I'm a private investigator myself," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"A very dangerous occupation."<br/><br/>"Not really. Most danger I face is when a client is late paying me."<br/><br/>"Well, since you have a very safe job...allow me to show you this policy," says Fritz, opening up his suitcase.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy wanders around looking for Francis, clutching his life insurance policy. "Francis!"<br/><br/>O'Donnell ducks out of the shadows. "Hello, Jimmy," he says with a sigh.<br/><br/>"Francis, this is my favorite author!"<br/><br/>Francis stiffens when he recognizes Krakauer. "How nice to finally <i>meet</i> you he says."<br/><br/>"Yes," says Fritz, "how nice to <i>meet</i> you as well."<br/><br/><i>The Amazon, February 1920</i><br/><br/>Rain pounds down upon the forest. A figure, dressed in jungle khakis, looms out of the mist, a Thompson wrapped in oilcloth slung over a shoulder. He walks briskly to a cabin made of corrugated tin and throws open the door.<br/><br/>Inside is a man tied to a chair, with a bag over his head.<br/><br/>Francis O'Donnell pulls the bag off the man's head. "WHERE'S JAX!" he screams.<br/><br/>"I don't know!" sputters Fritz Krakauer.<br/><br/><i>Paris, 1923</i><br/><br/>Fritz Krakauer closes his book and sits down. The nice woman from the Socialist Artist's Council stands up. "Thank you, Monsieur. We all enjoyed that reading very much. And now, our meeting is concluded. Please enjoy the refreshments."<br/><br/>There is polite applause all around. A young woman comes up to Fritz's table. "That was such a lovely book, monsieur, although I'm afraid I didn't understand it very well. I'm a singer, you see, and not that literary. That's more my husband's interest."<br/><br/>Trying to hide his disappointment that this beautiful girl (who is <i>actually talking to him</i>) is married, Fritz looks up from his tea. "Thank you, Frau--"<br/><br/>"O'Donnell," she says. "Isabelle O'Donnell. My husband is an American. There he is, over in the corner."<br/><br/>Hearing his name, Francis looks up from the notes he has been taking on this meeting of possible subversives (surely his clients in the Deuxi\xe8me Bureau will be interested). He glances at Krakauer, and then stares--first in surprise, and then in a glare of menace.<br/><br/>Krakauer tries to hide behind his teacup.<br/><br/><i>Prague, 1920</i><br/><br/>A young brunette woman walks up to an apartment building and begins ringing a doorbell. The name on the plate next to the buzzer is Franz Krakauer.<br/><br/>After several moments of buzzing, the shutters on an upstairs window are thrown open and a young man's face appears. "Are you Fritz Krakauer?" says the woman.<br/><br/>"Ja?"<br/><br/>"Jackson Elias, I'm the one who's taking that room your family has to rent. Hey, I read your stuff. I thought it was pretty good. A little derivative of Kafka."<br/><br/>"Why does everybody keep saying that? I've never even met him! Now I'm sorry, fr\xe4ulein, but I'm late for work--"<br/><br/>"Oh, I'll walk with you." She waits until Krakauer, carrying two suitcases and a bundle of papers, emerges from the front door.<br/><br/>"What is your profession, Jackson?" asks Krakauer as they walk towards his job at the Workers' Accident Insurance Institute.<br/><br/>"I'm a writer."<br/><br/>"Very dangerous profession, ja?"<br/><br/>"You know, it is for me."<br/><br/>"Perhaps you'd like some insurance? I have some at a really decent rate."<br/><br/>"I don't think I need Czechoslovakian insurance, thanks."<br/><br/>"Ah, but you are in Czechoslovakia, are you not?"<br/><br/>"Well, how can I argue with ironclad logic like that?

Jax!" says Jimmy, wandering around the party, clutching a prettily-wrapped package. "Oh, hi Freddie."<br/><br/>"What ho, Scotty. Still investigating?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I have my own office now. I'm a private investigator."<br/><br/>"Didn't you use to work for me? I seem to remember giving you a paycheck."<br/><br/>"You give everyone a paycheck."<br/><br/><i>Archangel, Russia, 1919</i><br/><br/>Snow swirls under a dark and cloudy nighttime sky. Three figures walk towards a stone cottage. One of the men shoves open the door.<br/><br/>Inside is a man tied to a chair, with a bag on his head. The man reaches forward and rips off the bag.<br/><br/>"Where's Jax!" shouts Freddie.<br/><br/>"I ain't telling you nothing," says Francis O'Donnell, struggling futilely against his bonds. "You're with the Reds."<br/><br/>"Comrade Freddie, should I shoot him?" asks Alphonse Gilbert. He is wearing the uniform of a Commissar.<br/><br/>"You're all using her!" spits Francis.<br/><br/>"Using her!" says Freddie. "I want to <i>marry</i> her."<br/><br/>"<i>What</i>?"<br/><br/><br/><i>[That was the end of Act I. The tilt was:<br/><br/><b>Quotable</b>: I have a cunning plan.<br/><br/><b>Folly</b>: A single moment of miraculous luck.<br/><br/>I had wanted to do quotable for a while.]<br/></i><br/><br/><i>The White Star Line pier, July, 1924. The day after the party</i><br/><br/>"Thanks for bringing me down here, Herr Wright."<br/><br/>"No problem. Freddie was...well...tied up."<br/><br/>"Ja, you mean that horrible fight he was having with Fr\xe4ulein Elias?"<br/><br/>"Right."<br/><br/>They walk along the water, watching a ponderous steam liner fight the tide towards the pier. Jimmy glances around casually, and then freezes.<br/><br/>"Fritz, you see that black car down there?"<br/><br/>"Ah, the one surrounded by all those Italian gentlemen?"<br/><br/>"I recognize some of those guys. That's Lucky! And that guy of his, Al something...the cleaner, they call him. They only bring him around when the have to tidy up a crime..."<br/><br/>Jimmy's eyes go wide. "Come on, Fritz!"<br/><br/>"What are you doing? Where are we going? Why are you throwing me off this pier--"<br/><br/>A tremendous explosion tears up the decking all around them. Jimmy swan dives into the water. After a very long time he surfaces, dragging Fritz with him. Soon they have clambered out of the water and lay exhausted amid the burning wreckage.<br/><br/>"I can't believe I saved my favorite author's life!" beams Jimmy. "Boy, it's lucky for you I was there."<br/><br/>"Lucky," says Fritz, and coughs up a pint of brackish North River water.<br/><br/><i>The Amazon, February 1920</i><br/><br/>"If I hadn't had lunch with her," begins Fritz for the hundredth time, "I wouldn't have been fired for being late, and then I never would have gone on this insane expedition with her, and then I never would have made the unpleasant acquaintance of you, O'Donnell. How do you carry this thing?" he moans, trying to shoulder his enormous Enfield rifle.<br/><br/>"Everybody get down," shouts Francis, shouldering his Thompson. There's a flash of white in the clearing ahead, and he fires a burst.<br/><br/>Jackson falls down on the ground, knocked back by the bullet that has just grazed her shoulder. "Is there anything you do that <i>doesn't</i> involve me getting shot?" she screams at Francis.<br/><br/>"Get down!" he bellows, charging forward with a scream.<br/><br/>Fritz chucks his rifle into the bush and chases after them.<br/><br/><br/>Some hours later, the three of them are holed up in a different hut, which is surrounded by several paramilitary troopers.<br/><br/>"You goddamned idiots," says Jax. "Do any of you speak Portuguese?"<br/><br/>"What were you even doing down here?" barks Francis.<br/><br/>"I was on a university expedition!"<br/><br/>"Right. A university expedition to Communists!"<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"These are all Marxist revolutionaries!"<br/><br/>"Good for them!"<br/><br/>"Why were they chasing you around, then?"<br/><br/>"Nobody started chasing me until people started <i>shooting</i> at them!"<br/><br/>"My bad," says Fritz.<br/><br/>"Wait," says Francis. "I think they're going to--"<br/><br/>There is a shout from the woods. Twenty or thirty soldiers charge forward. Francis pulls the trigger of his Thompson, but the magazine is empty. Horrified, he realizes that they'll all be overrun--<br/><br/>Until the Marxists run straight into a minefield the government forces had planted the night before. Explosions rip through the forest. The hut is knocked completely down, leaving a mostly intact Jackson, Francis, and Fritz.<br/><br/>"I can't go anywhere with you," say Jackson and Francis simultaneously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The explosion makes Jimmy a hero. He gets hired by even more high profile clients.<br/><br/>Francis is decorated for his work in Archangel. He has the pleasure of putting Freddie on the boat back for England, where the F. O. wants to talk to him. He decides to stay in Europe for a few months, rather than going back to America, and boards a transport to France.<br/><br/>One night, he is out smoking on the deck when he sees a young woman in a nurse's uniform singing quietly in French. He is amazed--in the moonlight she is the most beautiful person he has ever seen. Silently, he offers her a cigarette.<br/><br/>"Thank you, monsieur--"<br/><br/>"O'Donnell." He looks in her eyes.

Not as brilliant as some of our other work--the Wild Party was probably the best of the three--but enough to go on. I think the concept was sound, but I probably needed to do more footwork to sell it. Also, FP really doesn't get Fiasco--I mean, he understands it, he just doesn't like to frame dramatic scenes. <br/><br/>Anyway, on to the actual episode, which features the return of Freddie Blakely, the final resolution of the Gavigan storyline, and a homecoming for Dr. Mwimbe. The episode title is a bit obscure, unless you know that I was raised on Long Island, and that the action takes place in Zanzibar...]</i><br/><br/><i>...sometime before...</i><br/><br/>Freddie gradually comes awake in a metal hospital bed. He has vague memories of loud noises, bright light, and people yelling at him. He notices James Gardner, formerly of the Clive expedition, sitting on a chair next to the bed, chain smoking as usual.<br/><br/>"Hullo, Gardner, this Egypt?"<br/><br/>"M wants to see you," he says, standing up.<br/><br/>Freddie is led to a large conference room. He has no idea where he is, other than a vague idea that he is underground. Paintings line the walls, of groups of people. One painting has someone who looks very much like M. The people in it are dressed in fashions from about thirty-five years earlier.<br/><br/>"Gardner, is that our boss?"<br/><br/>"I've discovered that it's best not to ask questions."<br/><br/>Tea is brought. They're still English, after all.<br/><br/>M finally comes in.<br/><br/>"What ho, Auntie!"<br/><br/>"Mr. Blakely, did I ever give you any indication that you should attempt to contact the Foreign Office?"<br/><br/>"You didn't give me any forwarding address."<br/><br/>"Let's follow that chain of thought, shall we? Mr. Blakely, did I give you the impression that I worked <i>for</i> the Foreign Office."<br/><br/>"I rather thought you did."<br/><br/>"No, Mr. Blakely. I work <i>with</i> the Empire, not for it. Our interests happen to coincide at the moment. It was easier for Colonel Pearkes to believe the connection was more direct."<br/><br/>"Well, I'm not a citizen of the Empire."<br/><br/>"As far as that goes, you may yet be one. It seems you gave a most remarkable speech at Commons."<br/><br/>"I don't remember that."<br/><br/>"Indeed. It was good enough that Baldwin allowed a vote of conscience and the Bill failed on third reading. Winston was very impressed."<br/><br/>She picks up an envelope and opens it. Pieces of a passport flutter down. "However, it seems you are not a citizen of the German Reich. It turns out they made a mistake in the paperwork. And at the moment, your British passport has been confiscated. Fear not, we will get you out.<br/><br/>"Unfortunately, Mr. Blakely, since you did not confront your attackers, we don't know who was behind it, except that they are very highly placed indeed. I am sure they have not forgotten you, however."<br/><br/>An elderly woman enters the room. "Ah, Mrs. Broadmoor," says M. "Mr. Blakely, I apologize for being rude, but you probably are noticing the room getting rather dim right now..."<br/><br/>Everything goes black for a while. Groggily, Freddie slowly comes to.<br/><br/>A somberly-suited man is standing in front of him, wearing a bowler hat. <br/><br/>Nothing unusual, thinks Freddie. He has a green apple for a head. I can deal with that. Must be the drug.<br/><br/>"These drugs are amazing," he says aloud.<br/><br/>"Ah, monsieur, you suffer from a misapprehension," says the...man? in a heavy French accent. "You are in a dream, not a drug stupor. You are here to meet...ah, well, here she comes now."<br/><br/>M comes walking up out of the gloom. As she does, Freddie can see things more distinctly. He seems to be standing on the shore of a very still lake, at evening when the sky is still lit even as night creeps in under the eaves of the forest surrounding them.<br/><br/>Something seems indefinably <i>younger</i> about M. Freddie realizes then that she is not wearing her trademark red scarf; he'd never seen her without it before.<br/><br/>"Come walk with me, Freddie," she says. "I'm sorry about all this, but it was the only way we could be sure of having a secure conversation."<br/><br/>They walk for a while along the shore. "Freddie, I'm afraid we're going to have to cut you loose now."<br/><br/>"What? You never even gave me any orders! I was left to fight Russian gangsters and whatnot."<br/><br/>"You do live a most interesting life. Fortunately you have a most excellent valet."<br/><br/>"Why don't you hire him then?"<br/><br/>"We did. He came looking for you, and almost found you. We admired that initiative."<br/><br/><i>[Freddie decided to make Alphonse his new Solace, to replace Sheila; I got the okay for this from GP.]</i><br/><br/>"Well, don't worry," says M. "We'll send you back to your friends."<br/><br/>"And my personal secretary?"<br/><br/>"I'm sorry, we don't know where she is."<br/><br/>"I see. Is there anywhere you want me to go?"<br/><br/>"Don't worry, we'll take care of all that."<br/><br/>"Well, is there anything you want me to look into?"<br/><br/>"I <i>shall</i> miss these conversations."<br/><br/>"I won't! This is an exercise in frustration! You're worse than N and H put together!"<br/><br/>"What a remarkable compliment," says M, as the dream begins to fade away.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427204/#Comment_427204" name="Item_350" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-15T19:20:03+00:00" title="January 15, 2014  7:20PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2014 7:23PM by Aviatrix.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Tonight That's Where I'll Be (Part 2)</b><br/><br/><i>Athens, Greece. Thursday, 25 June 1925</i><br/><br/>Francis steps out of the murky atmosphere of the <i>taberna</i>. Even at this late hour, Athens bustles around him; the sound of singing, loud conversation, and cursing swirls around him. He yawns, and stretches his back. The trip to Athens--48 hours of hell, from Trieste to Athens via several ferries and a backbreaking ride on a Greek bus--still isn't quite forgotten by his stiff muscles.<br/><br/>Suddenly, he spins and draws his automatic. A man step out of the shadows, holding a gun on Francis.<br/><br/>"Well well well shamus," says Eddie Gaffigan, "imagine meeting you here. D'ye wanna get a drink?"<br/><br/>"Sure."<br/><br/>"What do you want to do, count to three and we'll both holster our pieces?"<br/><br/>"Sure. One..."<br/><br/>"...Two..."<br/><br/>They both pause.<br/><br/>"Ah, if you're going to shoot me, you're going to shoot me," says Gaffigan, putting away his gun. He enters the <i>taberna</i>. Shrugging, Francis holsters his gun and follows.<br/><br/>They order drinks. Francis grabs an ouzo, and Eddie orders wine. "I've been a Frenchie so long I can't stop drinkin' the stuff," he says. He's returned to his native Northern Irish accent, Francis notices.<br/><br/>"Ye wouldn't happen to know where Eloise is, d'ye?"<br/><br/>"No. Sorry."<br/><br/>"Ah, 'tis to be expected. You're probably right, it wasn't a good plan. I had a way to control G\xe9vaud, but there were too many unexpected vectors on that."<br/><br/>He pushes away his glass. "We're not so different, shamus, you and I. I just made some different choices that were probably wrong, a long time ago."<br/><br/>"I would say that it's not too late, but in your case, I really think it is."<br/><br/>"I can't disagree with you there, Francis. What d'ye say we finish this thing?"<br/><br/>"I think we're finished."<br/><br/>"Oh, we're not finished, not you and I. You won, don't get me wrong, it's all over with me now. It's for Eloise, no matter whose fault it is. A man's gotta do something when the love of his life gets kidnapped."<br/><br/><i>[I am not ashamed to have stolen that sentiment from the last five minutes of </i>The Maltese Falcon<i>, possibly the best acting Humphrey Bogart ever did.]</i><br/><br/>"And yet instead of chasing after her, you went to Venice to take care of <i>business</i>."<br/><br/>"Boyo, you have no idea of the forces you're up against."<br/><br/>"I really don't."<br/><br/>"All I can tell you is, when it comes to the Carlyles, not a single bloody one of the bloody expedition is dead. People are going to tell you it's Penhew you have to watch out for. I worked for him for many years. The man is seriously crazy. He's into things I can't even imagine. But I don't even think he's the one to worry about."<br/><br/>He looks at Francis with a mad glint in his eyes. "They're going to be coming for you now, boyo. You have a very big name to ye. The organization's gonna be looking for you."<br/><br/>"Well, if you could find me, it shouldn't be hard for them."<br/><br/>"The thing is I'm a wee bit better at infiltration than they are, which is how I found you."<br/><br/>"I'm going to be honest with you. I need to find out what happened to my cousin."<br/><br/>"Well, we certainly tried to kill her in Paris. We almost did, except for your little friend the newspaperman. I hear they buried him in an envelope."<br/><br/>"If I find out anything in the course of my investigation about Eloise, I'll tell you."<br/><br/>"No, boyo, I think we need to have it out right now--"<br/><br/>There's a popping noise. Gafigan looks down. Francis has his silenced pistol out--the same pistol Gavigan had thrown him back in Paris.<br/><br/>"I was right," he says, slumping down. "Not so different."<br/><br/>Francis jams the pistol into his waistband, and quickly sneaks Gaffigan's wallet out of his coat. He tosses a few bills on the bar.<br/><br/>"Sorry about the mess," he says, and leaves.<br/><br/><i>[So, I wanted to give the PCs some closure on Gavigan, and not keep him in my back pocket; too many not-quite-dead villains drags things down and robs the PCs of their initiative.<br/><br/>Gaffigan/Gavigan was at the end of his rope. His entire life had been one long game of raising the stakes, until somebody finally came to call his bluff and it all came crashing down. He most definitely had a death-wish.<br/><br/>I had a vision of a nifty gun fight on the moonlight Acropolis (actually impossible, because it was the new moon at this point), but OP cut to the chase in a much more entertaining way. Given a chance, Gaffigan would have tried to kill Francis for sure--but he was really out of options no matter what, hunted by the cult, bereft of resources, and Eloise irretrievably gone. So RIP, Eddie.

(Part 3)</b><br/><br/><i>Thursday, 30 June 1925</i><br/><br/>Freddie awakens with a start. There is a loud knocking...somewhere. <br/><br/>He tries to look around, but everything is absolutely black. The air is stuffy. He tries to move his hands, but soon discovers that he is in an uncomfortably coffin-shaped area.<br/><br/>There is a ripping noise as nails pop free. A prybar bashes through the boards of his..box...and nearly smashes his noise. The bar swings down, and the lid to the box is pulled away.<br/><br/>"Hallo Mr. Freddie, hello Mr. Freddie, hello Mr. Freddie!" says Billy. "Miss M said I'm to take care of you."<br/><br/>"Oh good. Where are we?"<br/><br/>"In the Red Sea, sir. Approaching the Somali coast, I should think. Billy's kept your cabin nice and ship-shape, he has."<br/><br/>"Does this mean you work for Miss M?"<br/><br/>"No sir! Miss M made me better. Billy's much better now!"<br/><br/>In ship's saloon, Jimmy is poring over several textbooks on mathematics, psychology, and history. He glances up as Fritz Krakauer enters the room from the deck. Behind him, Freddie Blakely stumbles in.<br/><br/>"Scotty. Felix. What ho."<br/><br/>"Jimmy?" says Fritz.<br/><br/>"Freddie!" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I'm off to my cabin, I'm knackered," says Freddie. "Billy, do I have a passport?"<br/><br/>"No sir! That's why we had to put you in the box, sir!"<br/><br/>Freddie enters his cabin. Gilbert is sitting in the corner, smoking. He has already laid out clothes for Freddie.<br/><br/>"Gilbert, I understand I've been fired and you've been recruited. Do you have any idea what I'm supposed to do?"<br/><br/>"Can't talk about that."<br/><br/>"I see."<br/><br/>Someone pounds on the other side of the cabin wall. "Keep it down in there!" shouts Francis. "I'm trying to brood."<br/><br/><br/><br/>They all meet later in the saloon. Francis plunks down a bottle of whiskey. "Gavigan's buying," he says.<br/><br/>"I suppose you're in on the great assassination plans," says Freddie to Fritz.<br/><br/>"No, I don't know anything about that," says Fritz, "although I'm sure I will hear about it soon. I've been around the block."<br/><br/>"Right, Austrians and assassinations," says Freddie. "Say, could you provide me with something to get me into Zanzibar?"<br/><br/>"A Czech passport would be difficult. But let me see..." Fritz grabs a suitcase, opens it, and shakes his head. He opens a second suitcase, looks through it, and then closes it. He opens a third suitcase. "Ah. Finland. There's like eight people in the country, it should be easy."<br/><br/>Freddie checks with his man of business via telegraph. He discovers that what liquid wealth that could be moved has been shifted into the American stock market. "Safe as houses! We'll make a mint!"<br/><br/>Jimmy is poring over <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOdkY1eU5mcFc1YWM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">a package sent to him by Bradley Grey</a>, his lawyer employer back in New York. They include some <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBORG9fQXVhUlFKVGM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">transcripts of psychotherapy sessions</a> Roger Carlyle had with Dr. Robert Huston, fellow member of the Carlyle Expedition, and some notes taken by Jackson Elias during her stay in Zanzibar that Jonah Kensington had forwarded to him.<br/><br/>He also has succeeded in decrypting <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sMh3rxM33j2XAKED6v8ODyg3i5FOpjc6RYRqjqhq8Fo/edit" rel="nofollow">the message he found in the ruins</a> of the Fondation Aubrey Penhew, using the notebook he found in Gavigan's Venetian villa. Francis had to help him with the final translation:<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>Avez-vous des changements pour Lovelace? J'esp\xe8re qu'elle sera fini en Ao\xfbt. Le baronnet m'a dit que Babbage projet a \xe9t\xe9 achev\xe9 la semaine derni\xe8re, il n'attend plus que les syst\xe8mes de guidage. Nos amis les ont d\xe9truits. C'est b\xeate - ils ont fait des probl\xe8mes pour nous depuis trop longtemps. Je me suis dit que le plan de M'Weru est trop risqu\xe9. Certes, si la situation ne s'aggrave, je vais prendre les choses en mains propres.<br/><br/>==================<br/><br/>Do you have any changes for LOVELACE? I hope that it will be finished in August. The baronet told me that project BABBAGE was finished last week; he waits only for the guidance systems. Our friends have destroyed them. It's stupid--they have made problems for us for too long. I have said to myself that M'Weru's plan is too risky. Certainly, if the situation gets any worse, I will take matters into my own hands.<br/></blockquote>\n<i>[I also have the notes from Jackson but I'll have to scan them in. Writing the Huston sessions was a lot of fun.</i><br/><br/>"Dr. Mwimbe," says Jimmy, "Do you know anything about someone named M'Weru?"<br/><br/>"M'Weru? It is a Gikuyu word that means <i>white</i>. Should I know who this person is?"<br/><br/>"Just wondering. Jax mentioned her name."<br/><br/><i>Wednesday, 1 July 1925</i><br/><br/>Freddie finds Dr. Mwimbe standing by the rail, watching the sun rise behind the islands of the Zanzibari archipelago. "Can you smell it, Mr. Blakely? That clove smell? Those are the islands of my home. You are welcome to stay at my home."<br/><br/>"You still have a family house here?"<br/><br/>"I do."<br/><br/>"I am deeply honored."<br/><br/>"You should be."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Zanzibar! The exotic Spice Islands! Once the capital of the Sultanate of Oman! Now a British protectorate, stripped of its mainland possessions, but still maintaining a sultanate. <br/><br/>The European population is small, under a thousand people. The caste and color system prevails among the locals--Omani Arabs on top, then the Zanzibaris who claim Persian descent, and then mainland Africans. It is the origin of the Swahili language.<br/><br/><i>[I actually found a book from 1920 on Zanzibar--thanks, Google Books!]</i><br/><br/>The oldest part of Zanzibar, the Stone Town, is known for its old houses, with elaborately carved doors in the Indian tradition. This is where Dr. Mwimbe takes her companions.<br/><br/>"Doctor, what is the socially appropriate form of our relationship?" asks Freddie.<br/><br/>"You are my guests.

The door is even more elaborately carved than the other doors in the neighborhood, showing signs of Indian and Persian influence; Charleston notes many signs in the twisting patterns that he has seen in the <i>Al-Azif</i>: protective spells, spells calling on the name of Nyarlathotep, as most incantations do.<br/><br/>They are met at the door by an elderly African man in a butler's uniform.<br/><br/>"Imani! <i>Wie geht es dir, mein lieber Freund</i>?" says Mwimbe with obvious pleasure.<br/><br/>"<i>Ganz sch\xf6n, meine gn\xe4dige Frau</i>," says the old man. "<i>Sind sie unseren G\xe4ster?</i>" <br/><br/>"<i>Ja.</i>"<br/><br/>Fritz and Freddie, who both speak German, look at each other and shrug. <br/><br/>"Maybe that's the only language they have in common?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>Mwimbe's other servant is a young Frenchwoman, her cook. "<i>Enchant\xe9e, messieurs</i>," she says, curtseying. "<i>Madame, je dois pr\xe9parer le d\xe9jeuner pour vous</i>?"<br/><br/>"<i>Non, pas maintenant.</i>"<br/><br/>The house is two stories high, built surrounding a large courtyard with a fountain. It has relatively few doors--most passages are left unblocked for ventilation--except for a large room with locked double doors on the second floor, next to Mwimbe's excellent library.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fritz and Francis head for the Port Warden's office to see if they can follow up on when the <i>Ivory Wind</i> was supposed to arrive in Zanzibar. Fritz, well-schooled in the ways of bureaucracy by stint of working in an insurance agency and having grown up in Austria-Hungary, secures a promise to get the records in a few days.<br/><br/><i>[Bureaucracy spend by KP.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie heads for the harbor and catches a ferry to Dar-es-Salaam, to chase down the leads from Jax's notes. He wanders around, asking after Jax, and using his connections to try and get appointments with the local officials.<br/><br/>Jimmy checks into local business records, using Jax's notes as a guide. She discovers that a single shipping company supplied the Carlyle expedition with most of their equipment. It's run by an Indian family; while everything is in her uncle's name back in Bengal, locally it is run by a woman named Dil Chandra Thakur.<br/><br/>It turns out that the <i>Ivory Wind</i> has shipped items from Thakur's warehouses back to Emerson Imports in New York.<br/><br/>Jimmy asks around about spiritualists and magicians. He hears that there is a tradition of sorcery and witchcraft on the island of Penga, the northern island of the Zanzibar archipelago. He also finds out that a local white woman, Mrs. N. Smythe Forbes, is very interested in spiritualism. With his characteristic understated charm, Jimmy gets invited to a s\xe9ance being held that very afternoon.<br/><br/>"Is there anyone you wish to contact?" asks Mrs. Forbes, a pleasant, grandmotherly woman.<br/><br/>"Yes, you!" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"But I am not on the other side! Oh, wait, I see. Is this to be a formal interview? We could go to my offices." She indicates the sitting room she uses to publish her English-language paper, <i>The Star</i>.<br/><br/>"Off-the-record," says Jimmy, who feels he is getting good at this journalism stuff. "Oh, whatever I ask, try not to freak out."<br/><br/>"I've peered through the veil, young man, I doubt there is anything you can frighten me with."<br/><br/>"Excellent! Have you ever heard of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue, or M'Weru?"<br/><br/>"I've never heard that name. The Cult is legend; they say it is a witch society on Penga. I don't believe it; you know those [racial slurs], very superstitious."<br/><br/>"Do you remember the Carlyle Expedition?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes, it was very exciting. Strange people though. We never saw Mr. Roger, he was always ill. Come to think of it, we never saw Miss Masters. I suppose you can guess what was going on. Sir Aubrey was very nice to me. He was interested in looking for a lost city somewhere in Africa; I put him in touch with our Mr. Jarmyn. Now, young man, you can't fool me. You're a reporter, aren't you? Are you from the Kane syndicate? We'd dearly love to have our little <i>Star</i> as part of the Kane syndicate."<br/><br/>"Actually, I work for a man named Freddie Blakely."<br/><br/>"Mr. <i>Roland</i> Blakely? The publisher of the <i>Golden Sentinel</i>? We don't get it very often, but I read every word! Such brilliance! Next you'll be telling me you know Wo Fong, the author of so much Oriental wisdom!"<br/><br/>In a flash, Jimmy realizes this must be Charleston. He remembers Sheila telling him once that she wrote down random things he used to say and published them in a column. "It's a small world."<br/><br/>"Wait, Mr. Blakely is here? Could you come down and grant me an interview? I'd be happy to give you free access to all of our files."<br/><br/>Jimmy makes his way back to Mwimbe's house and searches through her books. He finds a mathematics textbook and finally locates an entry on Babbage and Lovelace. Charles Babbage designed a mechanical calculator, called the Difference Engine, and Ada Lovelace was the first to realize that it would be possible to create instructions that would allow you to make the Difference Engine calculate many different kinds of problems. Checking his cryptography notes, Jimmy realizes that the search for such a mechanical device could be revolutionary in the field of coding.<br/><br/>"Hey Francis, this technology could replace computers!"<br/><br/>"Those guys who add up columns of numbers?"<br/><br/>"Yeah!"<br/><br/>But what does it mean? Why would the conspiracy be interested in such an obscure subject?<br/><br/><i>[1 point History and Cryptography spends by JP.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427526/#Comment_427526" name="Item_355" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T18:46:16+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  6:46PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Tonight That's Where I'll Be (Part 5)</b><br/><br/><i>Friday, 3 July 1925</i><br/><br/>As it turns out, Captain Montgomery, commanding officer of the Dar-es-Salaam garrison of the King's African Rifles, is an old classmate of Freddie's--in fact, he introduced Montgomery to his wife. They meet for tea.<br/><br/>"Listen Blakely, I could get in a lot of trouble helping you. Still, I owe you for pulling me out of the mud in Eton. What can I help you with?"<br/><br/>"It's a matter of my former fiancee."<br/><br/>"Which one, old man?"<br/><br/>"An American. I was rather infatuated with her, and she's left me a few instructions in her will--she's a reporter, you know. The Aunts made me a publisher, did I tell you."<br/><br/>"Good show, I suppose."<br/><br/>"So it's the Carlyle Expedtion--"<br/><br/>"Good Lord, Freddie, that old thing? It's a closed book. Nobody wants to hear about it."<br/><br/>"Except my fiancee, and Rotten Roger's sister, Erica."<br/><br/>"That shrew?"<br/><br/>"Well, I know her husband-to-be."<br/><br/>"Poor bloke. I'll look into our records and get back to you. Talk to you in a few days."<br/><br/><i>[Credit Rating spend by FP]</i><br/><br/>Freddie heads back to Mwimbe's house. "<i>Wie geht's</i>, Imani!"<br/><br/>"<i>Ganz gut, mein edler Herr.</i>"<br/><br/>"Excellent, excellent, keep up the good work."<br/><br/>"<i>Zum befehl, mein Herr.</i> "<br/><br/>"Doctor Mwimbe! I've found the most remarkable things on the mainland. An old friend who hates me--"<br/><br/>"That is not very remarkable, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>"Not at all, true. It seems this <i>Ivory Wind</i> ship carried things to Emerson Imports in New York. The very establishment that recommended you to us."<br/><br/>"I would authenticate artifacts for Mr. Emerson."<br/><br/>"Grey market goods?"<br/><br/>"I would never do something so illegal. Mr. Emerson was typical of white men dealing in African artifacts, he could not tell the difference between a forgery and an item of great value. He paid me a commission, which helped augment my salary from Columbia. I need not mention that my salary was lower than that of the other professors."<br/><br/>"I'm surprised you were on staff, to be honest."<br/><br/>"The School of Anthropology is somewhat more liberal than the rest of the college."<br/><br/><i>[More or less true; they certainly hired female faculty much earlier than many universities.]</i><br/><br/>"I also learned some Indian woman has something to do with that ship."<br/><br/>"We think we should go in and close her down," says Francis. "She has a connection to Gavigan, and whatever Jax was up to."<br/><br/>"Oh, Francis, I'm meeting my old friend Montgomery in a few days. Mind tagging along?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"I found out from the local newspaper lady about the Cult of the Bloody Tongue. Oh, I dropped your name," says Jimmy to Freddie. "She wants to meet with you!"<br/><br/>"Nobody wants to meet with me!"<br/><br/>"I know! But she's an exception."<br/><br/>"I think I should come to that too," says Francis. "It could be a trap. Fritz, you come with me. Find a place to hide this." He hands Krakauer a large revolver which he hides in a briefcase.<br/><br/>"Doctor, could you see about getting us a meeting with this Thakur lady?"<br/><br/>"An Indian? That might be difficult, but I could give you a reference--"<br/><br/>"This isn't really my wheelhouse," says Francis, "but I think it's yours. You have a very nice establishment. Couldn't we have a party to draw her out?"<br/><br/>"A party? With an Indian? I guess that could be done," muses Mwimbe. "Very well. She may even be a Muslim for all I know. I don't know anything about Bengalis, my servants were always Gujaratis."<br/><br/><i>[If you are playing along with the original </i>Masks<i>, Dil Chandra Thakur is my replacement for Tandoor Singh--ridiculous name, and a ridiculous character. Thanks to the </i>Masks Companion<i> for the suggested replacement. The spelling of her last name is important--Thakur is often Anglicized as Tagore (like Rabindranath Tagore); she rejects even that slight concession to English sensibilities. Her first names are a riff on a character I played in a fantasy game named Delshandra--she was from an Indian-style culture, so I eventually worked out that her name was really Dilchandra and merely poorly pronounced by everyone. Dil means </i>heart<i> in Hindi, and chandra means </i>moon.<i>]</i><br/><br/>Later that day, invites are sent from Dr. Mwimbe's house to all the best people in Zanzibar for a dinner party next week. Everyone accepts--including the Sultan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie is somewhat agog at hearing that the Sultan is coming. He asks Mwimbe what language is appropriate for speaking with the Sultan.<br/><br/>"Arabic."<br/><br/>"Suppose you could no longer speak Arabic."<br/><br/>"Then you must use English."<br/><br/>"Is that appropriate?"<br/><br/>"I suppose if you could learn Kiswahili in six days..."<br/><br/>"Six days may be cutting it a bit close," says Freddie. He hires a gang of little children to follow him around and point at things, telling him their names.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis spends some time ingratiating himself with the local police force, who are dropping by every day to prepare the security arrangements. The British officers in charge of the Zanzibari police are happy to bring him in on the arrangements, clearly recognizing a tough guy. Not without a few "That's all well and good, sir. But this Africa, sir. This is <i>Zanzibar</i>."<br/><br/><i>[Cop Talk spend by Francis.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Saturday, 4 July 1925</i><br/><br/>The Zanzibar <i>Star</i> is not much of a going concern--Mrs. Smythe-Forbes runs it out of her house, publishing a single-page broadsheet every day--usually.<br/><br/>"Mrs. Smythe, how wonderful to meet you," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"So nice to meet someone who understands the other side."<br/><br/>"I myself have been to the other side. I found it incredibly disturbing."<br/><br/>"They ask a lot of questions!" says Fritz.<br/><br/>"I happened to bring the Carlyle files from our morgue. And this is Mr. Jarmyn, and Colonel Endicott."<br/><br/>"Ah, Colonel--"<br/><br/>"<b>GOOD TO MEET YOU, BLAKELY!</b>" bellows the Colonel. <b>"YOU HAVE THE LOOK OF A CAMBRIDGE MAN.</b>"<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Well, yes--"<br/><br/>"<b>NEVER WENT TO UNIVERSITY MYSELF, WASN'T WORTH MY TIME. YOU KNOW COLONEL RHODES?</b>"<br/><br/>"I knew a Colonel Pearkes, a Canadian--"<br/><br/>"<b>AH, CANADIANS, NO USE FOR THEM. SOFT PEOPLE.</b>"<br/><br/>Fritz crawls out from under the table and sits back down with a sheepish look. Francis finally decides to put his gun back in its holster. The Colonel is a rather overpowering presence.<br/><br/><i>[In fact he always talks in ALL CAPS. I came as close as possible to yelling while doing the Colonel's voice.]</i><br/><br/>"Neville Jarmyn, Mr. Blakely, good to meet you. You want to know about what the Carlyles were looking for, and I can tell you. The Lost City of the White Gorillas!"<br/><br/>"Really?"<br/><br/>"Yes, my ancestor had the skin of one--well, what was left after he burned it for some reason."<br/><br/>"Was it on a mountain?"<br/><br/>"Why, yes, I believe the Lost City must be on a mountain. It was supposed to be in the Congo, but I believe they moved. To one of the lost worlds of Africa."<br/><br/>"What's a lost world?"<br/><br/>"<b>NGORONGORO, OLD MAN</b>," says the Colonel. "I HAVE A LODGE THERE. AMAZING PLACE, GIANT VOLCANIC CRATER."<br/><br/>"Amazing. Well, we'll have to come. Say, is this mountain called the Mountain of the Black Wind?"<br/><br/>"SUPERSTITION," says the Colonel.<br/><br/><i>[FP: No, Colonel, I wish to know more, can you speak to it?<br/><br/>Me, as the Colonel: WELL, I...PERHAPS IF YOU SPENT SOME POINTS FROM ONE OF YOUR POOLS!<br/><br/>FP: Colonel, let me flatter you some more...<br/></i><br/><br/>They speak with Jarmyn and the Colonel. In response to a question from Jimmy, Jarmyn indicates that there seems to be some relationship between the Egyptian myth of the Black Pharaoh, and the stories in Tanganyika about the Black Wind. While they talk, Fritz goes through the Carlyle file.<br/><br/><i>[KP: I copy down or filch whatever I think we need.<br/><br/>Me: ...our you could borrow it. No, no--you're player characters, please continue with your criminal activities.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie offers Mrs. Smythe-Forbes a regular column in his paper. Stars in her eyes, she readily agrees to let them borrow whatever they want.<br/><br/><i>[As it turns out, KP has a friend who went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngorongoro_Conservation_Area" rel="nofollow">Ngorongoro</a>.

So I am on vacation."<br/><br/>"It is beautiful," says Noor. "Palm trees...spices...and I am high-ranking here, because I am Arabic!"<br/><br/>"Noor, I'm on vacation, so I need you to look at all the books in the library."<br/><br/>"What? Charleston, let's talk. Are we partners in this thing, or what?"<br/><br/>"I thought you hung out with me for all this dark carnal knowledge."<br/><br/>"There isn't any carnal knowledge, and if there is, I should be informed. Why do I always have to do the menial work? I am still a young woman! I may have Coke-bottle thick glasses, and my legs may be unaccountably weak, but I can still do things. Like, I can turn a dog inside out with a spell! I can still have fun."<br/><br/>Charleston sets out to sit by the harbor and drink tea. He is approached by an American, dressed like him in a white summer suit.<br/><br/>"Noah Cross," the man says.<br/><br/>"We should order those little cucumber sandwiches, right?"<br/><br/>"I don't know, whatever you do in the Limey colonies. I'm a traveler. Like to go around the world, here--I do some work in Australia."<br/><br/>"I'm a photographer for an obscure and uncelebrated paper back in New York. What are you hoping to see here?"<br/><br/>"I've become a bit of an amateur anthropologist in my retirement. I've done all sorts of things, was a doctor for a while. Thought I'd come see Africa, though I don't think you can get a feel for it here--you have to go to the mainland."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fritz pores over the files provided by Mrs. Smythe-Forbes. The Carlyles made a big production about going on safari; they bought supplies from Dil Chandra Thakur. He finds some photographs--something bothers him about it, but nothing he can put his finger on.<br/><br/>He also finds out that there was a man named Sam Mariga, a mainlander who works at the post office in Zanzibar. Mariga, during one of his trips to the mainland, was the one who found the Carlyle massacre site. The British arrived and promptly hung several Mutumbis, a tribe well-known for their rebelliousness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie returns to Dar-es-Salaam with Francis. He has changed into sensible clothes--a white burnoose and a keffiyeh. Since he doesn't know how to wear it on his head, he wraps it around his neck. People shoot him dagger looks on the street.<br/><br/>"Everyone is so friendly here," he thinks.<br/><br/>Francis just shakes his head.<br/><br/>They try and find out more about the Carlyle Expedition and the Bloody Tongue Cult. The white people laugh them off; the Africans are difficult to get to talk, although Freddie's adorable coterie of children help break the ice eventually.<br/><br/>It seems the Bloody Tongue Cult is still a going concern here, or at least it's believed to be--children seem to be captured from time to time. If the Cult exists, they tend to worship on volcanic mountains.<br/><br/>They finally meet with Colonel Montgomery. "Freddie, this is Sergeant Bumption."<br/><br/>"Gov. 'Twas April of 1920. A [racial slur] named Sam told us he found a massacre. We hired some local guides, rough lot, mercenaries. Anyway, we found them in a clearing. All torn to pieces as if by a large animal. Recognized them all, Sir Aubrey, that poor Roger fellow, that American Brady."<br/><br/>"And so you hung some Mutumbis?"<br/><br/>"Very uppity lot they are, rebelled against the Jerries a few times."<br/><br/>"How did they manage to fake all that?"<br/><br/>"Sorry, sir?"<br/><br/>"How did they manage to kill all of them?"<br/><br/>"Well, you can't trust that type."<br/><br/>"That should satisfy you, Freddie," says Montgomery.<br/><br/>"It certainly answers some of my questions."<br/><br/>"There you are, then."<br/><br/>"My best to your wife. Are you still getting on?"<br/><br/>"She's in London, I'm in Africa. So there it is. Take care, Freddie."<br/><br/>"Lied to my bloody face," says Freddie to Francis, as they leave. "Saw all the Carlyles massacred indeed."<br/><br/><i>[Assess Honesty by Freddie.]</i><br/><br/>"Jax said she saw Brady," says Francis.<br/><br/>"And we saw Hypatia, although that may not mean anything, given her abilities."<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Saturday, 11 July 1925</i><br/><br/>The evening of the party, the courtyard of Dr. Mwimbe's house is covered with rich rugs and low tables. An enormous feast of delicacies from all of Zanzibar's heritage is served--dates, manioc, goat, rice, flatbreads, all pungently spiced.<br/><br/>The Undersecretary of British Affairs comes to the party, as well as a severe looking woman wearing an elegant sari in a Bengali drape. Freddie introduces himself. He is wearing Omani clothes, large ballooning pants and a tunic.<br/><br/>"Artol Vann, citizen of the Finnish Republic."<br/><br/>"You look like a buffoon, Mr. Vann. Why are you bothering me? I am trying to enjoy my lamb. It is not spicy enough, but what can one do."<br/><br/>"I understand you are in the importing business, and I have need of such services."<br/><br/>"You may speak to my clerk."<br/><br/>"Well, I happen to have made the acquaintance of Erica Carlyle..."<br/><br/>"Ah, the sister of the American idiot who got himself killed in the jungle."<br/><br/>"The same. I am investigating the death of her brother. I understand you supplied their expedition? And you may have a certain ship, the <i>Ivory Wind</i>..."<br/><br/>"Mr. Blakely--do not try to mislead me with such a blatant lie--this is not the time or the place. Please come to my office tomorrow and we may talk."<br/><br/>"Madam, you are quite remarkable."<br/><br/>"Yes, I am."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery spend by FP to get Thakur to even talk to him.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Like many people, the Sultan immediately hits it off with Jimmy.<br/><br/>"So, you are a private investigator? Like the Sam Spade?"<br/><br/><i>[JP: Uh, who's Sam Spade?<br/><br/>Me: That's perfect.]</i><br/><br/>"Uh, I suppose..."<br/><br/>"So, how many men have you shot, and how many beautiful women have you romanced?"<br/><br/>"Er...a real detective doesn't keep track."<br/><br/>"Ah, it like a desert thing for you."<br/><br/>"Your majesty," says Freddie, "I happen to know that Mr. Wright has saved at least one life, and been exploded four times."<br/><br/>"Ah, my ancestor was exploded, but much less successfully. Have you heard of the British-Zanzibari war? It lasted fifteen minutes.<br/> Mr. Wright, I invite you to come to the palace at any time. Anyone who is a friend of our esteemed Dr. Mwimbe must be a man of character. They say she is descended from the Mwiyini Mkuu--the last chieftains of Zanzibar before we Omanis came."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fritz meets Mr. Corydon, the British Undersecretary. "You are Fritz Krakauer, yes?"<br/><br/>"I am indeed."<br/><br/>"The writer?"<br/><br/>"Yes?"<br/><br/>"There is something I want to know--I shan't have the opportunity again, so--first, it is a very great honor to meet you. Secondly, what was Kafka like?"<br/><br/>"Uh..."<br/><br/>"According to Max Brod's biography, you were a great intimate of his, met him a the caf\xe9 every day. What a great loss for literature that he was called away."<br/><br/>"He got himself sick, he could have taken care of that but he chose not to. He was all right...I guess..."<br/><br/>"What are you doing in Zanzibar? It seems so far from Prague in both time and culture."<br/><br/>"I'm not really sure. I was given a ticket to come, and so I am here."<br/><br/>"How Kafkaesque, to coin a term?"<br/><br/>"Or Katzaueresque..."<br/><br/>"I suppose. I don't really know what that would be like. Oh, wait--didn't you write that one with the colony--oh, no, that was Kafka."<br/><br/>"Do you remember the Carlyle Expedition? I heard they were chasing after some White Gorilla city..."<br/><br/>"I think they were chasing after that [racial slur] who was traveling with them--supposed to have nicked all their funds. What must have happened is that they blundered into some taboo area and were killed."<br/><br/>"Do you believe these stories about Cults?"<br/><br/>"I'll tell you, they're still out there, or at least the [racial slurs] all believe so. Strange, a woman came asking about these things a year ago...had a man's name, Jackson something. Couldn't help her much. And now Leftenant Selkirk, the one who found the bodies, he died recently...and all the records were lost in a fire. Fortunately, the fire was contained to a small place...just burned that section."<br/><br/>Nobody dies, so it is a great success by the standards of Freddie and company. When Charleston climbs up to the library at the end of the night, to immerse himself in the books that have become his best friends, he is suddenly seized with a terrible fear.<br/><br/>He flips over several stacks of books before he finally has to admit it to himself:<br/><br/>The <i>Al-Azif</i> is missing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427654/#Comment_427654" name="Item_357" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-25T19:58:29+00:00" title="January 25, 2014  7:58PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Tonight That's Where I'll Be (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>"Noor," says Charleston. "The <i>Al-Azif</i> again..."<br/><br/>"I kept this room locked!"<br/><br/><i>[OP: Howabout you bring in...a detective?<br/>Me: If only you knew one...or two...]</i><br/><br/>Charleston summons Jimmy. "An important item has been purloined from my posession. I need you to make a discreet investigation..."<br/><br/>Jimmy asks the guards downstairs if they saw anyone come up, but they haven't seen anyone. Examination of the windows show no evidence that anyone entered the library through them.<br/><br/>He then checks the door. There is no sign that the room was forced. The lock wasn't picked.<br/><br/>While he is examining the door, Dr. Mwimbe comes upstairs. "James, you are asking the guards many questions. What is going on?"<br/><br/>"A valuable possession of mine is missing," says Charleston.<br/><br/>"Ah, yes. The book. I took it. It is too dangerous for you to continue to study. We have discussed this in our therapy sessions. It is too dangerous to your mental health."<br/><br/>"Do you know what this book <i>does</i> to people?"<br/><br/>"As a matter of fact, I do, which is why I took it from you."<br/><br/>"Well, I wish you luck. But it won't be enough."<br/><br/>"Mr. Charleston. As your therapist, I am restrained from saying the first thing that comes to mind. But as mistress of this house, I will tell you: it is very likely that I will bury you."<br/><br/>Jimmy watches Mwimbe closely. He can recognize that she is not lying about having taking the book. But trying to read the mysterious doctor more deeply only nets him the nagging belief that the one thing that can be said with total certainty is that Dr. Mwimbe did not want Charleston to have the book any longer--but her motives remain murky.<br/><br/><i>[Dr. Mwimbe is very difficult to read--she is a psychologist after all, and affects a certain hauteur. I've been consistently surprised at how nonchalant the players have been that an NPC is in possession of all their most powerful artifacts. Maybe it's because they fear them, since we are in a Cthulhu game--any D &amp; D game that I've played with FP and CP, I think they would have already made multiple death threats against any NPC holding out on them.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Sunday, 12 July 1925</i><br/><br/>Freddie is finally convinced by Gilbert that he should resume wearing European clothing, if he wants to make a good impression. He leaves his tie behind, though. Fritz, Jimmy and Francis come with him; Charleston insists that he is still on vacation and heads out on his own.<br/><br/>They find Thakur yelling at her crowd of Swahili and Bengali longshoremen. "Ah, the Englishman. Please follow me."<br/><br/>Her office is ornately furnished with Persian rugs and teak furniture, including a massive teak desk that she sits behind. "So, Mr. Blakely. What is it that you want? I assure you, it will be very difficult to starve <i>this</i> Bengali, although you are welcome to try, as the Raj has tried for the last 150 years."<br/><br/><i>[Bengal, like much of India, had chronic famine problems throughout the 1920s and 1930s (when it became acute). Bengal was also one of the more rebellious regions of the Raj, with several independence groups active at this time.]</i><br/><br/>"I'm confused, a common state of affairs for me."<br/><br/>"I see you have brought an armed thug, a...what is it exactly that he does?"<br/><br/>"Jimmy? He's off-putting. Bit of a philosopher."<br/><br/>"Ah. And a Jew."<br/><br/>"I was wondering when that would come up," mutters Fritz.<br/><br/>"Don't worry about Francis," says Jimmy, in a vain attempt to lighten the mood. "He's always armed. He would go armed to a little girl's birthday party."<br/><br/>"Then you do well to be in the company of a British man," says Thakur with some bitterness. "They often come armed to our children's birthday parties."<br/><br/>Freddie merely sputters.<br/><br/>"Now, Mr. Blakely," says Thakur, "I am taking out time from my schedule to speak with you, because I am intrigued to find out what you could possibly think would interest me. As my time is extremely valuable, I suggest you rapidly come to the point."<br/><br/>"I am here to investigate the Carlyle expedition."<br/><br/>"Yes, we outfitted them."<br/><br/>"Well, we've already met two members of the expedition, and we were wondering if you could introduce us to the rest."<br/><br/>"Why do you come and lie to me? The Carlyles are dead. Everybody knows this."<br/><br/>"I'm certain I've met two of them."<br/><br/>"Which two?"<br/><br/>"Hypatia, and Brady. Well, to be honest, we haven't met Brady ourselves, but the person who did is absolutely trustworthy."<br/><br/>"You are peddling the same story that Nails Nelson tells anyone who will listen. A drunken English mercenary, probably wasting away in the bars of Dar-es-Salaam."<br/><br/>"I see. Well, I wasn't joking last night about wanting to talk about business with you. I'm in the process of liquidating some assets, and I'm looking for investments with companies that are, shall we say, not so friendly to the Empire."<br/><br/>"I suggest your man of business call upon my clerk. Where are you staying?"<br/><br/><i>[Pronounced </i>clark<i>, of course.]</i><br/><br/>"You were there last night."<br/><br/>"You are staying there? With--with the doctor? How interesting."<br/><br/>"I find her fascinating. I'd be obliged if you could tell me more about her."<br/><br/>"She is a very intelligent woman. Her father was in the German Colonial Service for a time. They say she is descended from the Miyini Mkuu--an old and proud family, one of the few Swahili families to stay in power after the Omanis came. Her grandmother was from Penga; her mother, I do not know, she was from the mainland, the bush. Her father found her somewhere. She spoke Gikuyu with a strange accent."<br/><br/>"Do you enjoy math?" asks Jimmy.<br/><br/>"It is a speciality of the Bengalis."<br/><br/>"Have you ever heard of Lovelace or Babbage?"<br/><br/>"I have not. I could tell you of the great astronomers and mathematicians of India, but I do not have time. Good day."<br/><br/>"I really think we should break in and destroy everything she has," says Francis after they are escorted out.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427655/#Comment_427655" name="Item_358" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-25T19:59:12+00:00" title="January 25, 2014  7:59PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Tonight That's Where I'll Be (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>Charleston is having tea with Noah Cross at a different teahouse down by the waterfront. He is waiting for Cross to come back with some whiskey--they are bored of drinking tea--when a strange tingling comes over him. <br/><br/>Suddenly he realizes that he cannot lift his hands off the table.<br/><br/><i>[Stability Contest here, CP chose not to spend anything and rolled a 1.]</i><br/><br/>A rather scruffy looking man sits down next to him. "Name's Micawber," he says in a working-class English accent. "Take a farthing, stick a ha' penny nail through it, and nail it to bit of flesh--chicken, anything will do. Holds your limbs fast. Thought you would know that, you're a sorcerer aintcha?"<br/><br/>"I'm sorry, I can't understand your accent. Could you use another one?"<br/><br/>"Gov, you're amusing, aren't ya? Mr. Heep, come over please."<br/><br/>A hulking man dressed like a navvy heaves into view.<br/><br/>"So so so so," says Micawber. "Here's the man who killed the great Tewfik al-Sayed, and here you are with your hands tied to the table. Call yourself a sorcerer, you do? Look, gov, we'll make it easy on you, we just want the books."<br/><br/>"Done."<br/><br/>"What, you have them here witcha?"<br/><br/>"Don't you see that library behind me? Come on, who travels with so many books?"<br/><br/>"'E's takin' the piss of you, Micawber," says Heep.<br/><br/>"Why he is, isn't he. Mr. Heep, convince Mr. Charleston not to take the piss again."<br/><br/>Heep starts to throttle Charleston.<br/><br/>"So so so so," says Micaawber. "Where are the books?"<br/><br/>"At Mwimbe's," croaks Charleston.<br/><br/>"The doctor? Nobody told us--the doctor..."<br/><br/>Charleston yanks his hands off the table. "How much research did you idiots do? This is the only place I've stayed."<br/><br/>Noah Cross is standing behind Micawber and Heep. "Is there any problem, gentlemen?"<br/><br/>They turn to face him and grow pale. "No, no, no, gov. No trouble here. We'll be seeing you, Charleston."<br/><br/>"If you don't get lost," mutters Charleston.<br/><br/>"What kind of a sorcerer are you, anyway?" asks Cross, pouring out two glasses of whiskey. "Falling for a stupid folk magic trick like that. 'Stick a ha' penny nail into a bit o' meat' indeed." He snorts derisively.<br/><br/>"I'm seriously not a sorcerer!"<br/><br/>"Charleston Chiu, you killed Tewfik on the streets of Paris, and probably had something to do with the death of Mukunga in New York. Did you really think the sorcerer community would not notice?"<br/><br/>"And that guy in Egypt. Shakhti. Anyway, I'm not a sorcerer, I gunned those guys down! It must be embarrassing to them, to die after how many centuries!"<br/><br/>"They'll be coming for you. And what can you do to defend yourself? Not a bloody lot. Those two were merely the first. And after all, I found you as well. Not everyone is going to underestimate you like Tewfik did. Do you think we learned all this magic just to be brought down by a gun-toting thug?"<br/><br/>"But that seems to be what is happening! It's not my fault!"<br/><br/>"Charleston, I'm going to make you an offer. I think you're an interesting case. You could clearly be a sorcerer of power."<br/><br/>"And then get shot by some schmuck with a Tommy gun!"<br/><br/>"I can show you how to defend yourself against bullets. Look, I'm here for a few days, look for me wherever they sell tea."<br/><br/>"Well stay and have a drink. Are you really an anthropologist, or was that a cover?"<br/><br/>"No, I really am interested in humanity in all its different natures..."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie swings by the house. "Doctor, a few things. That Indian woman who came by the other night may come around to kill us all."<br/><br/>"Ah. Shri Thakur. Do not worry, we are safe here."<br/><br/>"Excellent. Also, many people are deathly afraid of you."<br/><br/>"My father was an important man."<br/><br/>"And your mother was from Penga."<br/><br/>"My mother? No, she Ameru, from near Arusha. Now if you are asking my advice, I would go with the Colonel and Mr. Jarmyn. If there is a cult, it won't be here among civilization."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy decides to do some actual investigation and goes to look for Sam Mariga, who turns out to be the gardener at the post office. The flowerbeds are remarkably beautiful.<br/><br/>"Nice flowers," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Thank you."<br/><br/>"Say, is it time for your lunchbreak?"<br/><br/>"Yes, we get fifteen minutes to eat around now. Then we must work through the afternoon, because they are British, and crazy."<br/><br/>"They are."<br/><br/>"I like you Jimmy."<br/><br/>They go around back and get some stew on a banana leaf from a cart. "Tell me about the clearing, and tell me the truth," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"The truth is a very dangerous thing."<br/><br/>"If I don't know the truth, I will go stumbling blindly into danger. If I know the truth, I will be able to see the danger coming to slap me in the face."<br/><br/>"The wise man, with his eyes wide open, would not go into this danger."<br/><br/>"The danger is already following me," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You are determined to hurt yourself, I will not stop you. But why do you ask me these things? I know nothing, that is what I told the reporter lady."<br/><br/>"I would reconsider you lying to me," says Jimmy, with menace in his voice.<br/><br/><i>[Intimidate spend by JP]</i><br/><br/>"I am a good man, I go to mosque, I...oh, all right. Everything they say about the Carlyle expedition is a lie. I have seen many dead white people, and I did not see any dead white people in that clearing."<br/><br/>There is an awkward silence.<br/><br/>"I was a porter in the war, against the Germans," says Sam by way of explanation. "There were many dead people there, but they were all their bearers. None of the expedition. I do not think any of them died, at least not there. As for what they were doing there, I asked people. I did not waste my time asking the white people! The Carlyles were asking about things you should not ask about. The were asking about the Mountain of the Black Wind. The Cult is very real, and has many branches--they say there is even one in New York. And they are tied to the Black Pharaoh cult, in Paris and London--it goes to the very highest levels of society! Now, you are going to the mainland? I will tell people to watch out for you, and help you if they can."<br/><br/>"Thanks, Sam. Sorry I got rough with you."<br/><br/>"No, do not worry.

Why else would she be with us?"<br/><br/>"Yes, well, do you think it's possible she'll kill us all in our sleep?"<br/><br/>"I think it's possible <i>I</i> may kill us all in our sleep. She did steal something of value from me. She may kill us, although I think she probably just wants to wrap things up and get out of here."<br/><br/>"Do you think Mwimbe is working with the people we are investigating, or against the people we are investigating?"<br/><br/>"I think the people we're investigating don't tend to work with other people."<br/><br/><i>[No comment.]</i><br/><br/>"They seem to work with Thakur."<br/><br/>"Yeah, but each one seems to be waiting for the opportunity to stab each other in the back.

You take a ha' penny nail, stick it through a farthing..."<br/><br/><br/><br/>They lay plans to break into Thakur's warehouse, under Francis' leadership.<br/><br/>"Donnie, I've noticed that your solutions are getting a bit, explodey," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"When have you known them to not be explodey?"<br/><br/>They decide to go in to find out information, and if necessary, destroy the warehouse to deny the conspiracy resources.

The steam launch is loaded with their luggage, and the non-combatants.<br/><br/>Jimmy scales the warehouse and throws a rope down for the rest of the group. They open a ventilation shaft and lower themselves down. Jimmy notes that the office is on the actual mainland and should be the target of their search--it could potentially have a basement.<br/><br/><i>[Athletics spend by JP, and everyone piggy-backed on it.]</i><br/><br/>Francis leads them quietly through the darkness and stacks of merchandise--bags of coffee, crates of spices, crates of various trade goods. It seems rather more empty than they expected--probably a shipment has recently gone out.<br/><br/>They reach the door from the warehouse to the office. A Bengali man is asleep in the doorway. Francis puts him into a sleeper hold, and drags the man off into the darkness. Jimmy worries that his muffled cries might have been heard.<br/><br/>Charleston looks at the door for a moment, and then pulls out one of his many skeleton keys.<br/><br/><i>[Locksmith use by CP.]</i><br/><br/>Francis stays in the doorway, while the rest enter the office. Freddie takes out some flashlights covered with red cloth, to hide the light and preserve their night vision.<br/><br/>They find Thakur's ledgers--shipments to New York, Paris, Shanghai, Australia, India are listed. There seems to be a rather high volume of shipping, most of which ends up in either Shanghai or Calcutta. The invoices are very vague, mostly listing "machine parts" or "artefacts." And of course quite a lot is written in Bengali, which they can't read.<br/><br/>Jimmy finds a trap door in the back of the office, under a rug. He heaves it open, and a staircase descends into the darkness.<br/><br/>Charleston, Freddie and Fritz descend the stairs, leaving Jimmy to guard the entrance. He waves at Francis--once again, the team of O'Donnell and Wright are on the job!<br/><br/>The stairs go down about eleven feet and end in a room about fifteen feet on a side. A large black idol of a very creepy worm-like being with multiple arms. Incense burns in front of it.<br/><br/>Charleston recognizes it as the Small Crawler, an aspect of--you guessed it--Nyarlathotep. He also finds a copy of a book written in Hindi. Although he can't read it, he recognizes it from the symbols on the cover--the <i>Cthaat Aquadingen</i>.<br/><br/>Freddie notices that there are depressions in the ground...roughly six feet long...that look an awful lot like graves. Nearby he finds a cleaver with a dark substance on it.<br/><br/>Fritz finds some incense cones next to the idol. The smell of the burning incense from the idol to be very...disturbing.<br/><br/><i>[Two-point Stability test by FP.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Upstairs, Francis is peering into the dark warehouse. Far off, at one end of the warehouse, he sees a light flicker. A little while later, he sees it again, closer, about the size of a torch.<br/><br/>Making a careful calculation, he fires his silenced pistol right where the chest of a torchbearer would be.<br/><br/>He doesn't hear the shot hit anything, but the flame flares up into the size of a beachball. And then it rushes straight at his head.<br/><br/><i>[FP: I think I need to roll Stability here...]</i><br/><br/>Francis screams as the fireball roars right past his head and straight at Jimmy, who ducks. The fireball zooms down the stairs.<br/><br/>Jimmy pops back up, staring at Francis. Suddenly he sees a flash of blue light, and another fireball races towards them from the far end of the warehouse.<br/><br/>Downstairs, everyone jumps back as the reddish fireball erupts in their midst. Freddie and Charleston race for the stairs, but the fireball <i>follows them</i> and engulfs Freddie. He screams in agony as he is immolated, and stumbles into the office, still on fire.<br/><br/><i>[Six points of Health to Freddie, plus he caught on fire.]</i><br/><br/>Francis goes to slam the door shut, but the fireball erupts on him just as he closes it. He stumbles back, dazzled and scorched.<br/><br/>Freddie rolls on the ground, snuffing the fire out, but still in agony.<br/><br/>From the door comes the <i>thunk</i> of a fire axe hitting wood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fritz races upstairs. The fireball intercepts him just as he clears the trapdoor. Flame erupts around him, and he falls to the carpet, still on fire. Freddie desperately looks around and spies a bucket of sand. He flings the sand on it just as Charleston races up the stairs. The choking sand envelopes the fireball and snuffs it out. <br/><br/>Francis aims at the door with his sawed-off and fires off a blast. He opens a huge hole in the door, and in the guy standing behind it. The blue fireball begins to flow through the hole into the office.<br/><br/>Jimmy, standing near the front of the office complex, hears a key turn in the door to the outside. Several figures with clubs begin to run into the antechamber.<br/><br/>"Come on Freddie," says Jimmy. He grabs Freddies hand and jumps through a window that opens out...over the harbor. They fall ten feet into the water.<br/><br/>A shot rings out, and Charleston jerks back. The blue fireball forms in the office around Francis, setting him on fire. Fritz jumps through the window and lands awkwardly, knocking the wind out of him.<br/><br/>Francis follows him, plunging through the darkness and crashing steaming into the water, quenching his flames.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Freddie begin to swim towards the steam launch, which contrary to human reason, but according to Freddie's orders begins to move towards them in the darkness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Charleston stands near the window, his head bowed. Thugs from the front door and the warehouse move towards him, and the blue fireball hovers eerily in front of him.<br/><br/>He raises his head. The fuse of his dynamite charge is fizzing and sputtering very, very close to the detonation charge.<br/><br/>Everyone pauses.<br/><br/>Charleston flips the charge in the air toward the fireball while doing a backflip through the window.<br/><br/>Charleston falls backward in an arc through the moonlight. The dynamite flies in an arc through the unearthly blue light of the fireball.<br/><br/>Charleston crashes into the water. The dynamite crashes into the fireball.<br/><br/>As he sinks beneath the waves, there is a sudden flash and a shockwave smashes him down. Debris and beams start to rain into the water.<br/><br/><i>[2 point Explosives spend, 1 point Physics spend to time the explosion, then Athletics tests to chuck the dynamite and make the dive.</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie heaves himself onto the deck of the launch. He begins to push pieces of driftwood towards the rest of the group in the water. <br/><br/>The explosion rocks the boat and dazzles him, but now there is suddenly more driftwood.<br/><br/>Jimmy turns back and helps Fritz make it toward the boat. A flow of burning oil cuts him off from the skiff as Charleston drags Francis  into the boat.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Jimmy, what's your drive?

Sadly, we let CP talk us out of letting PP play a gurkha, so he revived PC from the </i>Masks<i> game we played in together, Professor Jacques Parizeau of the Sorbonne. Which means I can keep using PP for him!]</i><br/><br/><i>Monday, 13 July 1925</i><br/><br/>The land towards dawn in Dar-es-Salaam and rendezvous with Colonel Endicott's party--the Colonel has gone on ahead to Ngorongoro, but Mr. Jarmyn is in charge. The group includes an archaeologist, Professor Jacques Parizeau, as well as a surprising amount of people who are clearly mercenaries. One of these is Nails Nelson, the man who claims to have seen Jack Brady in China. They carefully avoid him.<br/><br/><i>[Was a bit surprised by that, although frankly they already had all the information they were going to get.]</i><br/><br/>There is also a man named Janwillem Vanheuvelen, formerly an employee of the Clive expedition in Egypt, fired because he is not above selling artifacts he finds. <br/><br/>There is quite a bit of activity going on in the city that morning--it looks like the local garrison of the King's African Rifles has been called out along with quite a few of the territorials. Freddie buys a newspaper and discovers--<i>ahem</i>--that there was an explosion on the waterfront last night. This caused a fire that quickly spread to the low-income housing in the area, killing around twenty people besides those who died in the warehouse.<br/><br/>One of the dead is Mrs. Smythe-Forbes, who was burned alive in her home. The fire was a little unusual, as it seems to have raced directly at her house but not spread beyond that.<br/><br/><i>[Word of God: the fire was mostly the PCs fault; exploding buildings has consequences. Killing nice Mrs. Smythe-Forbes was Thakur sending off her fire vampires.]</i><br/><br/>The group decides to send Francis ahead to Durban to set up their passage to Australia, the next target of their investigation, while the rest of them head to Ngorongoro. Freddie manages to lead them through various narrow alleys and closed bazaars until they manage to elude the patrols and rejoin Jarmyn's expedition.<br/><br/><i>[Fleeing roll and associated piggybacking by the rest, bolstered by a Streetwise spend by FP.<br/><br/>PP: Can I use Theology to check in on the local Catholics and get their help?<br/>Me: ...well, they're both happy to see you, but there's not a lot they can do.]</i><br/><br/>The expedition is equipped with several dilapidated trucks, and they make slow but steady progress towards Ngorongoro, almost four hundred miles away.<br/><br/>On the way, Charleston has a dream. In it, he meets Mr. October, who tells him that while their mutual patron is still displeased by his lack of overt activity, the incident on Torcello was enough to stave off punishment.<br/><br/>But he demands that Charleson kill Noor, as a sign of fidelity.<br/><br/><i>Thursday, 16 July 1925</i><br/><br/>"There's no question about it," says Freddie. "We're being followed."<br/><br/>"Any idea who and how many?" asks Charleston.<br/><br/>"Haven't the foggiest. Do you think we could ambush them?"<br/><br/>Charleston shrugs and looks at his violin case.<br/><br/>"Well, let's just wait for them tonight, and then ask them to come in and have a chat."<br/><br/>Parizeau shakes his head. "I agree with all that except for the parley part; I think we should just kill them."<br/><br/>"What school of the Sorbonne do you teach at, again?" asks Freddie.<br/><br/><i>[Outdoorsman let Freddie know they were being followed, but he was out of spends for it so he couldn't get much more detail than that.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>That night when Freddie steps out to relieve himself, two men grab him and drag him off into the woods.<br/><br/>"Bloody hell, about time you showed up!" he says.<br/><br/>They mutter something in an Indian language, and then stab him.<br/><br/>Freddie tears off into the woods, heedless of direction. He can hear the men following hard on his heels as he dashes through the dark, almost moonless night. After what seems like hours, he finally eludes them.<br/><br/>Collapsing against a tree, he realizes that he is completely lost in the African jungle. And wearing his slippers and a dressing gown.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Charleston is patrolling the perimeter when he is set upon by two men with kukris. They slash at him viciously, and he slowly dodges them, taking several lacerations. Their eyes flash beneath their turbans.<br/><br/><i>[Sikh assassins, chosen by Thakur because they didn't speak English.]</i><br/><br/>He fires off his eldritch machinegun, but the assassins melt dodge into the shadows. The sounds of a screeching violin solo fills the air unnervingly. <br/><br/>His assailants dance in again, their knives flashing, stabbing and hacking at Charleston, who collapses in a pool of blood. He tries to feebly get up, but falls down again almost immediately.<br/><br/><i>[Yeah. The Sikhs (and yes, I know Sikhs don't use kukris, these guys were just hardasses) were Hit Threshold 4, and CP only spent two points to shoot them--somewhat characteristic of CPs play, he tends to underspend in these situations and it cost him when he rolled a 1. Also, he could have gone full-auto, but wasn't really up on the rules even though I've distributed them multiple times. So...<br/><br/>The kukris were -1 weapons, but the Sikhs hit him four times and did a total of 16 points of damage, knocking him down to -9 and then for whatever reason CP spent 2 points on the unconsciousness roll, knocking him down to -11; not a useful buy, as he couldn't have done anything even if he had stayed conscious.]</i><br/><br/>Parizeau, tracking down the sound of the violin solo, finds Charleston and the expedition medic helps stabilize him. Realizing how close he is to death, they head for a nearby mission hospital where he can recuperate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427743/#Comment_427743" name="Item_362" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-28T20:12:57+00:00" title="January 28, 2014  8:12PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Fire on the Mountain (Part 2)</b><br/><br/><i>Friday, 17 July 1925</i><br/><br/>Freddie makes several attempts to circle back towards camp, but by daylight he realizes he is totally lost. Fishing around in the pockets of his dressing gown, he finds a small compass and tries to use it to strike out towards where they were headed.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll by FP]</i><br/><br/>"How positively Robinson Crusoe," he mutters.<br/><br/>After about half a day, he strikes a village. The inhabitants stare at him cautiously. Several men emerge with large prangas, the machete-like local swords.<br/><br/>"Does anyone speak Swahili?"<br/><br/>"I speak Swahili," says one of the men.<br/><br/>"Well, I went out from my camp the other night, and was set upon by some Indian fellows. I've been wandering ever since and could use some help."<br/><br/>"I see," says the man.<br/><br/>They tie Freddie up and throw him in a hut.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Monday, 20 July 1925</i><br/><br/>Charleston is propped up in bed, reading with Noor. Outside, Parizeau tries to keep himself amused; there is nothing much to do here. Some of the mercenaries have gone forward already.<br/><br/>He sees a dust cloud approaching the village, and soon a truck pulls up. Several British soldiers jump out of the back. They speak to the doctor in charge of the hospital, and then start marching towards the building Charleston is lying in with a look of grim determination. <br/><br/>"The patient in there is very contagious," he tells the sergeant.<br/><br/>"Roight. We'll have to shoot him out 'ere."<br/><br/>"Let me go check on him," says Parizeau. He enters the room and quickly bandages Charleston's face.<br/><br/>The soldiers push in. "Just 'oo are you," says the sergeant. "You 'is doctor?"<br/><br/>"Sometimes."<br/><br/>"We're 'ere to arrest 'im and the terrorist Freddie Blakely,"<br/><br/>"There's no Blakely here. And those two are inseparable, so you are, as you say, barking up the wrong tree."<br/><br/>"P'raps we should just arrest the lot of you."<br/><br/>"How typically English of you! Rather than using your brain, you run around making conjectures. We are here doing incredibly important research, and my friend was wounded by natives."<br/><br/>"I'm sure they'll sort it out in Zanzibar. Our orders weren't concerned with 'is welfare."<br/><br/>"And if it was the wrong man? That would be terrible for your career."<br/><br/>The sergeant talks with his squad. Two take the truck and head back to the coast, to bring help (and a magistrate), while the sergeant and two other soldiers remain. They post a guard on Charleston's bed.<br/><br/>"Excellent," says Charleston. "Noor, listen to this passage." He begins to read aloud from his books.<br/><br/>He reads aloud every day, even after the guards stops showing up.<br/><br/><i>[Brilliantly funny bit by CP, and like a flash I realized what had to happen next...]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Sunday, 26 July 1925</i><br/><br/>"Visitors," says the village headman to Freddie. Two men enter.<br/><br/>"Mr. Blakely, my name is Sam Mariga; I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Wright in Zanzibar. This is Okongu, a man who may be able to help you."<br/><br/>"Is it true, Mr. Blakely, that you wish to combat the Black Wind?" asks Okongu.<br/><br/>"Not really. But I find that I must as they say, sack up and fight it."<br/><br/>"I represent someone who could be of great assistance to you. But he does not trust just anyone, and especially not a white man. Perhaps you could assist us, however, as a sign of good faith."<br/><br/>"What is it you need me to do?"<br/><br/>"Your companion, Mr. Charleston? Something terrible is happening in the village he is recuperating in. Witchcraft. We would like you to go there and stop it from happening."<br/><br/>They spend a few days hiking cross country. And then they reach the village...<br/><br/><br/><i>Wednesday, 29 July 1925</i><br/><br/>There are skulls, human skulls, mounted on poles outside the mission village.<br/><br/>"Sam, is this normal?"<br/><br/>"No, it is not. Some say the Black Wind is here, but I think it is something different. Something worse."<br/><br/>They circle around and manage to sneak closer. They see an altar in the middle of the village, made out of skulls. A man with his face painted with white and black paint and wearing a grass skirt is dancing in front of an altar.<br/><br/>He is also wearing the uniform coat of a British sergeant.<br/><br/>The other people in the village have their faces painted in a similar way. Some are having sex, some are hitting each other with clubs, many are chanting--sometimes while doing the other things. There is a large pen or corral in one corner of the village filled with a nervous crowd of people, most of whom are weeping or wailing.<br/><br/>Freddie enters the hospital room. "Charleston!"<br/><br/>"Freddie! Thank goodness you are here! This place is going to the dogs!"<br/><br/>"Yes. Charleston, did you know that they're sacrificing to the dark gods outside?"<br/><br/>"What? I didn't know that, the doctors stopped showing up a while ago."<br/><br/>"Didn't you hear the chanting?"<br/><br/>"This is Africa, isn't it? How was I to know what's normal. Hey Freddie, we're in trouble, they've sent for a magistrate and they're going to hang us."<br/><br/>"I think there's a rather more serious issue. Many of the natives think that you're some kind of a witch."<br/><br/>"I didn't want them to think that! Noor and I were just sitting in here, waiting for me to recover. I was reading my books, trying to occupy the time. In fact some of those chaps took an interest...oh."<br/><br/>"Noor, is it possible that Charleston was reading in a loud voice, so that the whole hospital could hear him?"<br/><br/>"It is not only possible, it is what he did!" she says.<br/><br/>"Is there any way to stop them?" asks Freddie.<br/><br/>"There's a way to <i>stop</i> them..." says Charleston.<br/><br/>"Short of death."<br/><br/>"I think you have too delicate a stomach. Wheel me to the window and open the shades."<br/><br/>Several people stare at Charleston and babble something. Then they begin to bow to him. Charleston realizes that they are giving the obeisance normally due...to a high priest of Cthulhu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427754/#Comment_427754" name="Item_363" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T05:17:18+00:00" title="January 29, 2014  5:17AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2014 5:18AM by Lisa Padol.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beautiful.

"We better do this before tonight."<br/><br/><i>[JP arrived at this point.<br/><br/>Me: Charleston has driven an entire African village insane.<br/><br/>JP: I'm not surprised.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie pokes around the hospital. He finds one of the Enfields left by the British. It is, of course, unloaded. He searches for a while and finally finds a single clip of bullets that fell behind a file cabinet.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness by FP; he found the rifle, but Bad Luck kept him from finding it</i>loaded.<i> He made an Evidence Collection spend to find the bullets.]</i><br/><br/>He spends some time watching the cultists. He identifies about fifteen of them, and that there seem to be three main factions. The largest is lead by the sergeant, but he thinks there are doctrinal differences between them.<br/><br/><i>[Anthropology use by FP.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie sighs, strips to the waist and sneaks out, hoping to blend in with the crowd outside. After a while he locates the hut Dr. Mwimbe is hiding in.<br/><br/>"What an interesting look for you, Mr. Blakely. You lead the most adventurous life. We seem to have a situation here."<br/><br/>"Charleston has driven the entire village mad."<br/><br/>"To be honest, is anyone surprised? I suppose the neighboring villages are planning to attack."<br/><br/>"Indeed. Charleston would like to speak to you about restoring the sanity of the individuals here."<br/><br/>"I think that would be quite entertaining. Let us go to the hospital." <br/><br/>On the way back, someone clubs Freddie from behind. "Arglebargle! Arglebargle!"<br/><br/>Freddie stabs him with the bayonet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Well Charleston, I suppose we should talk about this next session," says Mwimbe when she enters the hospital.<br/><br/>"Let's try and make sure there is another session. Listen, did you think this was going to happen when I was reading from my books?"<br/><br/>"I did not think it would happen on this scale. But then, I did not sell my soul to the Dark Powers."<br/><br/>"Neither did I!"<br/><br/>"Yes. You keep loving that rabbit."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Over in the corral, Jimmy Wright watches Freddie and Sam Mariga enter the hospital. He runs to the rock he keeps his stash of tools under and takes them out. Charcoal. White dust. Some grease.<br/><br/>He uses it to assemble a disguise, hoping to pass as a cultist. After all, he is Jimmy Wright--master of disguise.<br/><br/><i>[Disguise check, and a Reassurance spend shortly.]</i><br/><br/>"Brother! We have made a mistake and imprisoned you! We're very busy, we're bringing the Great One tonight!" says one of the guards when Jimmy catches his attention.<br/><br/>"Great, that's great..."<br/><br/>"We have just brought some sacrifices. Would you like the honor?"<br/><br/>He leads Jimmy to a huge altar made of human and animal skulls. Tied to it is an eight year-old boy.<br/><br/><i>This is a pickle</i>, thinks Jimmy.<br/><br/><i>[CP: I like how we're all laughing.<br/>FP: That's because when Jimmy Wright is on screen, it's comedy. I'm farce, he's comedy...you're some kind of dark psychodrama...<br/>CP: Like</i> Dexter<i>. Lots of interior monologue.<br/>Me: That's it! YOU'RE DEXTER!]</i><br/><br/>In the crowd, Parizeau suddenly comes to himself. He is wearing a grass skirt and white and black paint on his body. He realizes that he's spent the last several days dancing around and probably having sex with people.<br/><br/>"This is awkward," he says.<br/><br/>Jimmy steps up to the altar. "Don't worry, kid," he whispers. He raises the knife. "Wait! I have a better idea! We shall corrupt!"<br/><br/>"I don't know," says the cultist who lead him to the altar. "We've got a lot of sacrifices to get through. And there's so many preliminaries..."<br/><br/>"Yes, but what is the purpose of quantity if you don't have quality? You must prepare the sacrifices."<br/><br/>"Let me go talk to the high priest," says the cultist dubiously.<br/><br/>As soon as no one is looking at him, Jimmy cuts the ropes tying the child down. The boy slips over the back of the altar and runs for the forest. Jimmy jumps down, grabs Parizeau, and slips into the hospital.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428048/#Comment_428048" name="Item_366" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T20:44:46+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  8:44PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2014 8:46PM by Aviatrix.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Fire on the Mountain (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>"Jacques, you are so sunburnt it's ridiculous," says Charleston.<br/><br/>"Does someone have a change of clothes?" asks Parizeau.<br/><br/>"I think you might want to keep those.

"He will make the sergeant...retire. During the ensuing chaos, we can free the captives."<br/><br/>Noor points out that the spell requires a sacrifice of a sentient being. And waiting until darkness.<br/><br/>They huddle. Charleston decides to use the Hoy-Dhin chant to asphyxiate the sergeant, while Parizeau unleashes the Howl of Pan to stun them.<br/><br/>Jimmy watches while the cultists butcher some cattle. The blood pours into pits dug near the altar.<br/><br/>"Oh, it's for the <i>blood</i>!" he mutters. <br/><br/>Freddie asks Charleston if he still has his machine gun.<br/><br/>"Welll...the gun is more like a pet..."<br/><br/>"Wait. Have you turned your machine gun into some sort of horrible soul-eating machine."<br/><br/>"No, it doesn't eat souls. That's horrifying. Actually, it's no longer a weapon in of itself. It's actually a tiny, extradimensional portal. See I got tired of carrying things, because I never have what I need, so I made an extradimensional portal that I could carry around in my vest. Turns out once I opened up the portal, tiny little egg sacs fell out and hatched into spiders. Except instead of legs they have tentacles. Well, this is no good, I said, they're consuming the flesh of all they encounter. How can I harvest this and make it into an advantage? And I was like, I know! I'll make a spigot. And I'll use my machine gun as the spigot. And you can open the spigot and close the spigot. Well, it turns out you can <i>open</i> the spigot, but closing the spigot doesn't turn out so great. Aaand the butt stock that goes into your arm? Sometimes turns into a carnivorous squid and tries to eat your arm."<br/><br/>"So I take this to mean that you no longer have a functional machine gun but some eldritch weapon of horror."<br/><br/>"Well, <i>functionally</i> its a machine gun, so an eldritch machine gun of horror."<br/><br/>"All right, I'm just going to stand over here and make a Stability check."<br/><br/><i>[Couldn't resist leaving that line in, because FP said it in character.

Jimmy slips out the door and joins them, still in his disguise.<br/><br/><i>[...and fails his Stealth check]</i><br/><br/>Unfortunately he runs into his old friend, the one who "freed" him from the corral. "Hey brothers! Here he is, the guy who told us the RIGHT way to do the sacrifices! And he's been talking to the Master!"<br/><br/>They lead him in front of the altar and the steaming pools of blood. Captives are being tied to stakes. "Right," says the former sergeant, "We've figured this out: one of us breaks the neck, one of us slices his belly open, and one of us stabs him in the heart. Brother," he says to Jimmy, "Which one do you want to do?"<br/><br/>From the hospital building, a singing of unearthly beauty begins. "The Master sings!" shout the cultists.<br/><br/><i>[CP began singing</i> Bohemian Rhapsody<i>, which is appropriate since Freddie Mercury was born in Zanzibar.]</i><br/><br/>Jacques runs out of the hospital building at this point, takes a huge breath, and then shouts, a wordless cry of terror and pain--that despite being wordless caries a sense of ceaseless horror and menace.<br/><br/><i>[Howl of Pan spell--fail your Stability test &amp; you're temporarily blasted.]</i><br/><br/>Cultists drop to the ground, howling themselves. A few manage to stay up, including the three "faction" leaders. Freddie takes aim at one of them and cooly blows his head off with a well-placed Enfield shot.<br/><br/><i>[Picture Freddie cooly standing next to the window, a cigarette dangling from his mouth. It's one of my favorite images from the campaign.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy sprints for the captive pens. "Brother," says the guard there, "I've prepared them all, tied up and everything."<br/><br/>"Great! Fantastic! You're awesome! You're missing out! Let me take over and you can join in while the Master blesses the chief!"<br/><br/>"Thank you brother!" shouts the guard, already running off towards the altar.<br/><br/>Jimmy opens the corral and starts shoving people out. One of them grabs Jimmy. "Thank you, brother! Now I can join the ceremony! We have to stop them, bring them to the altar!" Obviously, he's suffering from Stockholm...er, Tanganyika syndrome.<br/><br/>Jimmy brings up his pistol and swings the butt at the deluded captive. He ducks away. "Are you not of the body?" he says incredulously.<br/><br/>Back at the altar, black ichor has begun to rain down on the former sergeant. It coats his face and body, blinding him. He begins to scream, but it flows down his throat, blocking his airway.<br/><br/>Freddie shoots another faction leader, who takes a nasty flesh wound but continues marching towards the hospital. Freddie fires again and blows his head off. With his last round, he shoots the sergeant, putting him out of his misery.<br/><br/>With great sorrow, Jimmy spins the gun in his hand and shoots his assailant in the gut.<br/><br/>Freddie, Charleston, Parizeau, Noor and Mwimbe catch up with him and together they dash into the woods. "Follow me!" says Freddie. "I've got a compass!"<br/><br/>The next day they reach a small village, the home to several of the freed captives.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After resting for a few days, they resume their journey to Ngorongoro. The weather is very fine, and at night the sky is full of thousands of stars. Jimmy feels that something about them bothers him, but he can't put his finger on it. Maybe it's the frequent meteor showers.<br/><br/><i>Monday, 10 August 1925</i><br/><br/>It's a steep climb up the side of the massive volcanic crater that forms Ngorongoro, but well worth it. A veritable lost world is spread out below them. Even from this height they can see herds of antelope and wildebeest, as well as elephants and giraffes. Occasionally a distant roar suggests that a pride of lions is somewhere below. A rather ominous mountain rises from one edge of the crater.<br/><br/>They finally locate Colonel Endicott's lodge. They are greeted by Joe, the strangely silent African who seems to be the Colonel's only servant.<br/><br/>They are shown their rooms. The Colonel does not greet them himself, but Freddie finds him in the drawing room, crammed into one corner, wearing a hat and dark glasses. He is wrapped in blankets and swaddled with mosquito netting.<br/><br/>"You must forgive me," says the Colonel in an uncharacteristic hoarse whisper. He does not get up. "I have contracted a tropical disease. Please do not come close, I may still be contagious. No, I'm doing fine and soon will be better. I am glad you have come. You are looking for the Mountain of the Black Wind? I have had visitors, Blakely, mystic visitors. I did not believe Jarmyn's stories about white gorillas, but there are beings on the mountain--not gorillas, but something more astounding. I will tell you more tomorrow. Please relax in your rooms. Joe will help you--he never speaks, but he understands English. Thank you, old man."<br/><br/><i>[My players are not that well-versed in the Lovecraft canon, or this setup would have been a dead giveaway.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie goes back to his room and summons his companions. "Now, maybe I'm just suspicious because of all the people who have tried to kill us over the last year, but I think the Colonel is acting quite suspiciously, and in fact may not even be the Colonel, and we are all in grave danger."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429353/#Comment_429353" name="Item_369" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T21:03:56+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  9:03PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Fire on the Mountain (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>"When's dinner?" asks Charleston. Freddie summons Joe, who merely points to a bell, implying he will ring it when it is time. <br/><br/>"Thank you, Joe," says Freddie. "How long have you worked for the Colonel? It seems to me that you're the man who runs this establishment, and are clearly the most intelligent person here. How long has the Colonel been ill?"<br/><br/>Joe sizes Freddie up, hesitates, and then says in a strong, clear voice: "The Colonel has been acting most unusual lately."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery use by FP]</i><br/><br/>Freddie blinks, then asks how long it has been going on. Joe explains that the Colonel started going on the mountain during the night, supposedly to help his friend Jarmyn. Joe, who does not live with the Colonel--for reasons of aural health--discovered the Colonel one morning much the same way Freddie found him. He brings Endicott food, which he leaves out for a long time, but it is eventually eaten.<br/><br/>Freddie recommends Joe make himself scarce that evening.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The group spends a while bathing and changing clothes. Jimmy, freshly scrubbed, takes a walk around the grounds. He finds some unusual tracks on the ground, like no animal he knows.<br/><br/><i>[Jimmy has Outdoorsman.]</i><br/><br/>Jacques asks Charleston for a book to read.<br/><br/>"Are you trying to drive this man insane?" demands Noor.

The one where you pretend to be the Colonel? Why don't you take off the hat?"<br/><br/>"I don't think I can, Mr. Blakely. And I don't think you should try to take them off me--I am quite contagious."<br/><br/>"What did you see when you went on this mountain?"<br/><br/>"Beings from another world, the likes of which cannot be described in words found in the English language. They are wonderful creatures, very very wise. They can fly between the spaces between the stars. And they work with many humans. Sometimes they take them with them. Obviously, your form would not survive. It is very simple. They take your brain, and place it in a cylinder. With marvelous devices you can see and hear and speak! And you are quite, quite safe!"<br/><br/>"Have you taken one of these journeys?" asks Charleston.<br/><br/>"I will soon. As will some of you--especially you, Charleston Chiu."<br/><br/>Freddie takes down an elephant rifle from the wall. He finds a couple of shells behind a chair.<br/><br/>Jimmy starts to back away slowly. Suddenly he senses a...presence behind him. He gulps.<br/><br/>Then he draws his gun and fires it under his arm into whatever is behind him, without turning.<br/><br/>Everyone except Jimmy turns in the direction of the gunshot. A...creature is standing behind Jimmy. It resembles some horrid cross between a crustacean and a flying insect. Pincers and multiple legs wave sickeningly in the air, and horrid, foul-smelling ichor spurts from the gunshot wound in its abdomen.<br/><br/>"A Mi-Go," sighs Noor.<br/><br/>The creature slashes at Jimmy, who stumbles forward. <br/><br/>"I see my friends have arrived," says the Colonel. "Enjoy your trip to Yuggoth, <i>old man</i>."<br/><br/>Parizeau cowers behind a davenport. <br/><br/>Freddie raises the elephant gun and blasts the creature in its chest. It collapses into the hallway, making a hideous shrieking noise that slowly peters out.<br/><br/>Charleston looks out of the window. He sees three more Mi-Go flying down from the mountain.<br/><br/>"You can't hope to win, old man," says the Colonel. Freddie grabs a saber off of the wall and runs the Colonel through.<br/><br/>He quickly realizes that there's nothing but a stuffed bolster in Endicott's clothes. His head, however, tumbles off. It's the Colonel's head, all right. The brain has been removed from the skull.<br/><br/>Behind the armchair they find a cylinder hooked up to several devices. The voice they've been hearing comes from one of these devices. There are also cylinders labeled "Blakely" and "Chiu."<br/><br/>Parizeau mutters, "It is said the Mi-Go worship a god named Nyarlathotep..."<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos spend by PP.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy runs out and grabs a large can of coal oil. He and Charleston start turning the empty cylinders into firebombs. They have just finished when a Mi-Go crashes through the window into the living room. Parizeau lobs the firebomb at the alien, which catches on fire but seems to have been merely made angry. It buzzes around, setting the room on fire. Charleston gives an anguished cry as the precious alien devices begin to malfunction in the heat.<br/><br/><i>[CP complained that only Bad Luck ever seems to come in play as a Drive; fair enough, so I offered him a soft driver to go and save the alien equipment. He turned it down.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston points his eldritch machine gun at the creature and blasts it. The sound of a hideous violin solo fills the air, and the Mi-Go crashes to ground.<br/><br/>Freddie suddenly feels a horrid, murderous chill spreading over his body. He turns and sees a Mi-Go standing at the end of the hall, filling it with a black mist it fires from some kind of gun.<br/><br/>Jimmy scrambles up onto a trophy rack, nervously eyeing the fire. Parizeau tries to jump through the window, but his sleeve catches and soon is on fire.<br/><br/>Freddie scrambles up the mannequin of the Colonel. His elephant rifle tumbles from his grasp.<br/><br/>Charleston blasts the Mi-Go at the end of the hall, which screams horribly but continues laying down the black mist. Jimmy leans out from the wall and fires his pistol at the alien, but can't get a bead.<br/><br/>Parizeau manages to put out the fire, but the mist flows over his legs. He shrieks in agony as the cold of interstellar space sears his flesh.<br/><br/>Freddie grabs an assegai from the wall and hurls it down the hall, just as his old Oxford chum Prince Ismail taught him. The spear catches the alien dead between the eyes. It stumbles back and lands on its back. The mist spews up in the air, flowing over the fallen Mi-Go.<br/><br/>Just then the wall behind Jimmy explodes. <br/><br/>He is thrown through the window and tumbles to the ground. In the air above him, he sees the third Mi-Go raise a weapon and fire a rocket into the lodge. Another explosion rips through the building.<br/><br/>Freddie scoops up the gun, jumps on a davenport, and tumbles out the window, landing neatly on his feet. Just like that time in, oh, let's say, Rome.<br/><br/>Parizeau tumbles out the window, flopping down by Jimmy. Charleston tears down the hallway, reaching the back door just as the living room explodes.<br/><br/>Freddie gets a bead on the flying creature and blasts it. The creature turns towards him. It raises the strange weapon--<br/><br/>--and Jimmy Wright rolls up in front of Freddie, pushing him out of the way as he empties the clip of his pistol into the alien.<br/><br/>There is a shriek, and the last Mi-Go plunges out of the sky and lands at his feet.<br/><br/><i>[I've said it before, I'll say it again: Big Damn Hero.<br/><br/>CP and JP wanted to lift the alien RPG, which was attached to the Mi-Go's arm.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie dashes into the pantry and grabs some supplies before the room catches on fire. He convinces his companions to flee down the side of the crater and into the night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429355/#Comment_429355" name="Item_371" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T21:05:54+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  9:05PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2014 9:03PM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Fire on the Mountain (Part 8)</b><br/><br/><i>Saturday, 15 August 1925</i><br/><br/>They hike through the jungle, heading vaguely east and south, hoping to eventually find a friendly settlement or the sea. After several days, they strike a very eerie clearing. <br/><br/>It is an empty plot of dead ground. Nothing grows on it. No birds seem to fly across it. A deathly silence fills the air.<br/><br/>They realize they have found the site of the Carlyle massacre.<br/><br/>Charleston finds various occult signs carved into the trees around the site. Many are tribal hex signs, but some mean..."worship the god for what he did here", "we offer blood and sacrifice to you." Many of those are recent.<br/><br/><i>[Occult use by CP.]</i><br/><br/>Parizeau finds enough potsherds and evidence of firepit use to make a rough estimate that the place has been used for worship for centuries...maybe millennia. There's enough Egyptian influence that he can suspect that the Cult of the Bloody Tongue is involved.<br/><br/><i>[Archaeology, Theology by PP.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy finds signs that Europeans seem to have visited recently--survey marks, old cigarettes. They seem to have been looking to build something here...something quite heavy, like some kind of industrial installation.<br/><br/><i>[Evidence Collection, Physics, Architecture by JP.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie notices a man standing in the middle of the clearing. A man who wasn't there just a minute ago.<br/><br/>The man has deeply black skin, and is wearing a large fetish mask.<br/><br/>"What ho!" says Freddie, in Swahili.<br/><br/>"You profane this place with your presence."<br/><br/>"I was under the impression it was unholy."<br/><br/>"It is holy...to <i>me</i>."<br/><br/>Charleston notes that the mask the man is wearing resembles the mask Mukunga was wearing in New York, but much more elaborate. <br/><br/>"I suppose you are not into forgiveness, are you?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"It has never been one of my qualities," says the man.<br/><br/>"We're going to have to fight now, aren't we?"<br/><br/>"I don't think you should do that, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>"What, does <i>everybody</i> know my name?"<br/><br/>"We've already met."<br/><br/>"Why...are you Shakhti Bey?"<br/><br/>"You dishonor me with the name of a servant."<br/><br/>"Ah. The illustrious Mr. N--"<br/><br/>There is a thunderclap. A black beam lances into Freddie and throws him halfway across the clearing.<br/><br/>"Leave us!" says Parizeau in Ancient Egyptian. He begins scrambling through his memory for an exorcism ritual.<br/><br/>"Who are you?" says the Black Man. "You remind me vaguely of someone."<br/><br/>"I'm like no one you've ever dealt with before. And you need to leave this place."<br/><br/>"Wrong again." <br/><br/>Parizeau is struck by a black beam and thrown clear into the trees. He collapses, unconscious and bleeding badly. Freddie limps over to help him.<br/><br/>"Ah, Charleston," says the Black Man. "Last chance. Will you not come worship with us? I understand you are having difficulties with your current boss."<br/><br/>"Yeah, the trouble is he's my boss. Look around. See what good work I've been doing as an independent contractor--"<br/><br/>"As you wish."<br/><br/>And Noor is struck by a black beam and thrown into the air. Hideously, ironically, she is turned inside out before she smashes into a tree with a sickening squelching noise.<br/><br/>"Blakely, give up on your pursuit now. You have meddled in my affairs too long."<br/><br/>"I don't even know what you're up to? I--"<br/><br/>At that point Freddie notices the large group of locals who have circled the clearing.<br/><br/>"If we meet again," says the Black Man, "it will go badly for you." He vanishes, and the locals charge.<br/><br/>Charleston, shrieking in rage, fills the air with tentacled projectiles. The all flee into the woods, Freddie and Jimmy taking turns lugging Parizeau. After several hours they manage to lose their pursuers.<br/><br/><i>Sunday, 16 August 1925</i><br/><br/>The next day, Okongu and Sam Mariga find them wandering in the woods and arrange safe passage to South Africa.

While Miss Ford seems rather prim, she is a veteran of the Great War's nursing corps and skilled at dealing with "shell shock" which is the best diagnosis anyone has come up with for what ails Charleston.<br/><br/>Having accomplished that, Freddie sets off to go to the British Consulate, to try and sort out this situation, even though he's aware that their most likely course is to arrest him and deport him back to Britain. He also may be a bit drunk. Well, more than a bit really.<br/><br/>He has just come in sight of the Consulate when a man bumps into him. "Ah, sorry sir. But you're precisely where I want you to be. Please come with me."<br/><br/>Before Freddie knows what is happening, he is sitting at a lovely outdoor caf\xe9 table with his cousin Bertram Wooster. <br/><br/>"Bertie, what are you doing in South Africa?"<br/><br/>"That's just the pip, isn't it? The Aunties are rather distressed. Something about disgracing the family name--apparently high treason is the bar for them. So me and my man Jeeves here--"<br/><br/>"Good day, sir," says the quiet man who bumped into Freddie.<br/><br/>"--popped down here to intercept you. I'm <i>supposed </i>to ask you to surrender."<br/><br/>"If I may, sir," interjects Jeeves, "surrendering now would severely curtail your freedom."<br/><br/>"They're going to hang you, old boy," says Bertie. "Bit of a dashed business if you ask me."<br/><br/>"I've taken the liberty of providing you with some identity papers," continues Jeeves. "Your name is now Count Orlok, a former subject of the Russian Empire, currently a subject of the Kingdom of Siam. I would not subject these papers to much scrutiny, but they should suffice for now."<br/><br/>"Well, thank you. By the way, have you heard from Auntie M?"<br/><br/>"Sorry sir? Do you mean Wilhelmina Murray. I have the fortune to be acquainted slightly with the young lady."<br/><br/>"Unless you're much older than you look, James--"<br/><br/>"--Jeeves, sir."<br/><br/>"Jeeves, then. I think she's significantly older than you."<br/><br/>"Possibly, sir. I have found it is an excellent policy to never inquire after a woman's age. She sends her best regards; in fact, she asked me to look into your matter. Now, if you gentlemen could excuse me, I have one or two matters to take care of in this regard."<br/><br/><i>[FP explicitly set out to play Bertie Wooster, so I figured it was an excellent time for him and Jeeves to make a cameo. Plus, it let me set one or two ideas in motion...]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis is cleaning his guns in the safe house when there is a knock on the door. He picks up a gun and opens the door a crack.<br/><br/>An extremely elegant Englishman is standing in the hall. "Good afternoon, sir. My name is Jeeves. I am an acquaintance of Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>Francis cocks his pistol.<br/><br/>"Indeed, sir, I anticipated that reaction. May I present my card?"<br/><br/>Still eyeing him suspiciously, Francis lets Jeeves into the room. "I see you have prepared yourself quite splendidly for your trip to Australia. May I help you arrange transit? A man named Captain Jan Hardekker can provide you with transport that I think will be very difficult to trace."<br/><br/>"Thank you, Jeeves," says Francis, somewhat amazed, as he lets Jeeves out.<br/><br/>Not much later, he and Jimmy arrive on the waterfront and head to the docking slip Jeeves wrote down for them. To their surprise, tied up there is a 250 foot long, four masted, steel-hulled clipper ship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429545/#Comment_429545" name="Item_373" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T20:35:37+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  8:35PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2014 8:36PM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Sea So Deep and Blind (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>"Captain?" says Francis to a rather weatherbeaten, gaunt man standing on the dock, shouting orders.<br/><br/>"Yes? Ah, they told me someone would be coming down," he says in a thick South African accent. "Jan Hardekker."<br/><br/><i>[My South African accent sucks normally, and completely deserted me this session, so poor Captain Hardekker generally sounded like an Irishman with a cold.]</i><br/><br/>"Frank. I understand you're going to Australia--"<br/><br/>"Ja, it's the last voyage of the <i>River of Stars</i>--"<br/><br/>"Last voyage!" says Jimmy. "But she's beautiful!"<br/><br/>"Ja. Steamship lines have destroyed the clipper trade, except for some German ships. But she's as fast as anything on the water. We're leaving for Melbourne tomorrow, going to lay her up when we get there."<br/><br/>Francis arranges to meet the captain with his "company" the next morning. They'll sail on first tide. <br/><br/><i>[So, clipper ship isn't as nuts as it sounds. Down in the "Roaring Forties"--40 degrees southern latitude--the winds blow nearly constantly from west to east, and with no land in the way they hit high velocities. Normal passage from South Africa to Melbourne would be about 25 days; this is about twice as long as a steamship, but only long haul liners could make the trip direct rather than going through Ceylon. The other advantage is that practically no one would expect a sailing ship, so the PCs would have nearly untraceable cover. </i>Nearly<i>, of course, is not a sure thing in an RPG.<br/><br/>And anyway </i>CLIPPER SHIP<i>! How cool, right?]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie and Wooster have been drinking--and not paying--their way through several bars. Along the way, Freddie came across the same issue of the New York <i>Inquirer</i> as Jimmy bought; his eyes are drawn to a long article about the relationship between the wounded Bradley Grey and the "terrorist" Freddie Blakely. One passage at the end of the article strikes him like an ax between the eyes:\n<blockquote>The acting editor of Blakely\u2019s weekly, the \u201cGolden Sentinel\u201d, Miss <br/>Sheila Brisbane, said that the paper had no comment on the attack on <br/>Mr. Grey and no knowledge of Blakely\u2019s current whereabouts.</blockquote>\n"Adelaide's <i>alive</i>?" he mutters, and staggers out to find a telegraph office. <br/><br/>STUCK IN BLOODY DURBAN STOP HOPE DORIAN'S ALL RIGHT STOP HOPE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT STOP<br/>PLEASE WRITE BACK SOON MAY BE HEADED BACK TO ENGLAND INVOLUNTARILY STOP<br/><br/>He of course never notices the strange man who watches him carefully while he is in the office, and follows him when he leaves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Later that night, Francis is sitting up in his room. He's spent a long day spreading a safari cover story to all and sundry. He hears someone shouting from the street, and looks out the window.<br/><br/>Freddie is standing outside the hotel, about to shout out again that he has lost his key, when several men in suits surround him and knock him to the ground.<br/><br/><i>[Rare fail of a Sense Trouble roll by FP.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy, who had been sent out by Francis to find Francis, sees this just as he approaches the hotel.<br/><br/>The men handcuff Freddie and start dragging him away. "You're comin' with us," says one in a thick South African accent.<br/><br/>"Don't say anything, Freddie! I'm his lawyer!" shouts Francis. He hops over the windowsill and slides down the awning to the street.<br/><br/>Freddie, who has been taking lessons from Gilbert, starts fishing around in his cuffs for the handcuff key he keeps hidden there.<br/><br/>Jimmy tries to creep up on them but one man peels off, draws a gun, and starts looking in the shadows for him.<br/><br/><i>[Failed Stealth roll by JP.]</i><br/><br/>Realizing that he has been "blown", Jimmy shouts out "Stop in the name of Military Intelligence!"<br/><br/>Francis races up to them, whips around the corner while drawing his sawed-off. Freddie has been tossed to the ground behind three of the agents, who are reaching in their coat pockets, probably for guns. As Francis takes this all in, he sees Freddie unlatch the handcuffs from his wrists. But what most concerns Francis is that he can see a fourth agent aiming a gun at Jimmy, who is blissfully unaware that he is dead in the sights of a gunman.<br/><br/>Francis draws his heavy revolver with his left hand. Holding guns on everyone, he shouts out, "I see you there too! Drop it!"<br/><br/><i>[Intimidate spend by FP to keep them from shooting Jimmy.]</i><br/><br/>"This isn't any of your concern," says one of the agents. Behind him, Freddie gets up and takes off for the alleyways.<br/><br/>Francis waits until Freddie has turned a corner. "Hey, he's getting away!"<br/><br/>The agents whip around, and are about to run after Blakely, when they realize that a crazy American with several guns is now <i>behind</i> them.<br/><br/>"Well, let's go," says Francis, and starts running down a different alley than the one Freddie took. The agents exchange glances and follow him.<br/><br/>In the narrow warren of alleys and streets, Jimmy soon manages to give everyone the slip. He heads for the rally point, one of the hospitals in the city. Suddenly he stops dead.<br/><br/>He doesn't have his rabbit's foot.<br/><br/>It's in his other pair of pants.<br/><br/>Back in the hotel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie, having blissfully forgotten about the rally point, doubles back and heads for the hotel, the now no-longer safe house. As he approaches, he sees a man standing in the doorway.<br/><br/>He decides to take advantage of his recently acquired tropical tan and goes for a North Indian disguise. He fashions a turban out of a sheet, strips off his shirt, and walks up jauntily to the hotel.<br/><br/>The man in the doorway stands up. With a sinking feeling, Freddie realizes that the agent is Indian himself.<br/><br/>Freddie plays mute, and responds to the man's questions with grins and gestures towards the back of the building. The agent shrugs and goes back to smoking.<br/><br/>From the back, Freddie sneaks into the servants' entrance and climbs up to his room. He glances around, shrugs, and grabs some clothing--Jimmy's clothing, since Francis's clothes won't fit. Of course, the rabbit's foot is in the pocket of the trousers he puts on.<br/><br/><i>[For "manipulating the metaplot" in such an egregious way, I charged FP an experience point.]</i><br/><br/><br/><i>Tuesday, 25 August 1925</i><br/><br/>At dawn, Francis and Jimmy meet Mwimbe, Gilbert, Miss Ford and Charleston at the docks. Freddie arrives shortly thereafter, stripped to the waist and wearing a turban, out of breath from having run all the way from the hotel after finding the name of a ship captain on a slip of paper in the room. He is carrying much of their luggage.<br/><br/>Jimmy observes the crew boarding the ship. They strike him as disreputable even for the waterfront. There are surprisingly few of them; Captain Hardekker mentions that the ship can sail with fewer than twenty men. "You have to take what you can get, when you go looking for a crew with sailing experience. Especially with no guaranteed passage back from Australia."<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tug drags them out of the harbor, and soon the <i>River of Stars</i> spreads a remarkable amount of sails. Not long after, Durban sinks below the horizon. The ship speeds on, clearing ten knots most days, heeled hard over into the icy waters of the great Southern Ocean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429584/#Comment_429584" name="Item_374" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T14:27:24+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  2:27PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

Sometime after midnight, a very seasick Jimmy makes his way on deck. Shivering in the icy spray, he attempts to light a cigarette.<br/><br/>There is a flash of lightning, and in it he sees several members of the crew, with weapons in their hands, heading towards the wheelhouse.<br/><br/>Jimmy draws his gun and runs toward them, spraying bullets everywhere. The mutineers stop and turn around. Several hit the deck. But four draw knives and charge at him.<br/><br/><i>[We ended up treating this as an Intimidation spend, rather than a Firearms test.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Down below deck, Francis looks up when hears a banging noise. Probably just a sail flapping, he thinks.<br/><br/><i>Bang.<br/><br/>Bang. Bang. <br/><br/>BangBang.</i><br/><br/>He slips out of his hammock and throws a pistol at a sleeping Freddie. "There's trouble," he says as Freddie sputters awake. "Stay here and shoot anyone who tries to kill you."<br/><br/>Francis slips out into the hallway. In the dim light of the gimballed lamps, he sees two men with knives creeping down the hallway. He aims his silenced pistol and shoots one of them twice. The other mutineer flattens himself against the wall.<br/><br/>A crash comes from Francis' cabin, a sign that Blakely is finally waking up. The mutineer starts for a second. Francis seizes his opportunity and runs down the hallway, slamming the man into the wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Back on deck, Jimmy scampers away and starts climbing one of the masts. The ship pitches beneath him as he shoots past the top and into the topgallants. Glancing back at the deck, he sees two mutineers climbing up the shrouds after him.<br/><br/>Jimmy draws a surprisingly large knife and starts hacking at the rope. "If you keep climbing, I'm cutting it all the way through!" he shouts out. <br/><br/>The mutineers start climbing faster.<br/><br/>Jimmy saws through the rope. The high tension shroud snaps back in his face, and he stumbles back into the mast, nearly slipping off the yard. One of the mutineers crashes into the water, but the other starts inching his way down the yard.<br/><br/>Jimmy looks down again. He sees Francis come out on deck, holding a can of coal oil. He watches Francis lash the can to a rope, puncture it with his knife, and then start hauling it up until it is level with with him.<br/><br/>Down on deck, Francis aims a flare gun up at the sails.<br/><br/>Jimmy's eyes widen and he starts to slide down one of the shrouds. Francis fires the flare gun. It arcs high in the air, then lands perfectly on the can of coal oil, which explodes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie knocks on Captain Hardekker's cabin. "Good morning, Blakely," he says.<br/><br/>"Morning. It seems that some of the crew are trying to kill us."<br/><br/>"What?" Hardekker runs inside and pulls some switches. Klaxons begin to ring. Hardekker grabs a cricket bat and races with Freddie onto the quarterdeck.<br/><br/>The mate who was standing the watch has been stabbed to death in the wheelhouse, and one of the ship's boys reports that he found the first mate dead in his cabin.<br/><br/>Four Lascars jump up onto the quarterdeck, knives drawn. <br/><br/>There is a shriek behind them and Jimmy comes swooping down one of the shrouds. He crashes into the surprised Lascar, knocking him unconscious to the deck. Jimmy stumbles to a stop by slipping into the captain, who goes sprawling.<br/><br/>Two of the Lascars stab at Jimmy as he lies on the deck, but he rolls away from them. Freddie shoots one of them in the face, and he falls bleeding to the deck. Francis draws his enormous Webley revolver and shoots another in the back.<br/><br/>Then he pauses. Two of the Lascars have grabbed the Captain and one of the cabin boys. "Drop your weapons," one croaks.<br/><br/>The deck pitches under their feet. Francis brings up the pistol. Without saying a word he shoots the mutineer holding the boy.<br/><br/><i>[OP was out of Firearms, but took the shot anyway.]</i><br/><br/>"That's to show I mean business," he says.<br/><br/>A man in a turban strides out onto the quarterdeck. He is wearing black robes and holding a pistol. "There is no need for any further violence. This is between me and Mr. O'Donnell. Drop your weapons."<br/><br/>Meanwhile Jimmy and a mutineer are rolling across the icy deck, heading right for the edge. His gun slips out of his hand and slides into to the ocean. As he and the mutineer continue to slide, in a flash of lightning Jimmy can see an enormous wave heading directly for the ship.<br/><br/>Jimmy grabs the mutineer, and shoves him in front of him. A well placed kick knocks him over the side and he splashes into the ocean. The deck begins to pitch the other direction, and Jimmy starts sliding back.<br/><br/>And an enormous wall of water crashes into the boat, inundating everyone.<br/><br/>Francis tumbles backward, dropping his gun, but managing to grab the rail and stand upright. The man in the turban grabs a shroud and swings around in the thrashing water, firing at Francis who ducks at the last minute.<br/><br/>Freddie is thrown against the rail, still aiming at the turbaned mutineer. He shoots at him but misses cleanly. The last two mutineers rush at Freddie, stabbing at him with knives as Blakely starts running around a mast.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, help Freddie!" shouts Francis. Jimmy starts crawling towards Blakely.<br/><br/>"How sporting!" thinks Freddie. "I can use my old Oxford tech--"<br/><br/>The mutineer in front of him suddenly ducks. "Why would you duck?" thinks Freddie. He turns around and a swinging yard smacks him in the face.<br/><br/>Jimmy leaps forward as the ship begins to pitch again and tackles the other mutineer, who stabs him as they hit the deck. Francis stumbles forward and decks the turbaned man. He slips back, dropping his gun but grabbing Francis and the both fall down and start sliding towards the rail.<br/><br/>Freddie continues to dance around the mast, laughing at the mutineer. Until the man stabs him in the chest.<br/><br/>"Oh," says Freddie. Blood stains his shirt. He steps back, holding his stomach in pain. He raises his pistol and blows his assailant's head apart.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis and the turbaned man continue to tumble down the deck, careening towards the rail--<br/><br/><i>Blue-tinged Leverage style flashback!</i><br/><br/>--Francis is back in Durban, buying supplies. He sees a small ice ax for sale. He picks it up, considers it, and then adds it to his purchases--<br/><br/>--Francis pulls the ax out of his coat. He lashes out with it at the turbaned man, who pulls back in surprise, slips, and then falls over the rail into the sea.<br/><br/>Francis continues to slide down the deck. He jams the ax into the deck--<br/><br/>--and the handle begins to slide out of the pick--<br/><br/><i>[Failed Athletics roll by OP]</i><br/><br/><i>Blue-tinged Leverage style flashback, part two!</i><br/><br/>As Francis leaves the supply store, the camera zooms in on the box he found the pick in. "Souvenir--not for actual use," it says.<br/><br/>--with a gasp, Francis smashes into the rail and tumbles into the ocean. A freezing cold wave smashes him into the side of the ship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy sees Francis fall overboard, but has a Lascar on top of him. The deck pitches back and forth under them as they roll around. The mutineer catches him with a vicious cross. Jimmy starts to black out, but shakes his head free of cobwebs.<br/><br/>The deck pitches back again. Jimmy begins to count. "One...two...three..."<br/><br/>"Why are you counting?" shouts the mutineer, trying to stab him.<br/><br/>The deck pitches again. "One," says Jimmy, rolling away from the mutineer. "Two," he says, jumping to his feet and grabbing the mutineers arm as the ship pitches back. "Three," he says, as the ship pitches in the other direction, yanking the mutineer backwards.<br/><br/>"Four,"  he says, punching the man square in the face as the ship pitches forward. With the added momentum he knocks the man off his feet, over the rail, and into the ocean.<br/><br/><i>[Outdoorsman spend by JP to use the ship's motion to refresh his Scuffling pool.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis is trying to claw his way onto the side of the ship when a life preserver flutters down next to him. He pulls it over his head and scrambles up as someone pulls him back up over the railing.<br/><br/>To his astonishment, it is Jimmy at the other end of the rope, bleeding from several cuts, one eye blackened, but with a proud glint in it.<br/><br/>"Jimmy," says Francis as they stagger back to their cabin, "I'm proud of you."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429613/#Comment_429613" name="Item_376" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T20:42:25+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  8:42PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Episode XIII: The Sea So Deep and Blind (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy sees Francis fall overboard, but has a Lascar on top of him.

None of the latter are anything close to an <i>able</i> seaman, but they do their best, hauling on whatever they're told to haul and scrubbing what needs to get scrubbed.<br/><br/><i>Sunday, 13 September 1925</i><br/><br/>Jimmy is up on deck early in the morning, playing with his rabbit's foot and thinking despondently about how long it has been since he spoke with his sister. Suddenly, he jerks up. Ahead of the ship, a large shape can be seen looming in the mist. As the <i>River of Stars</i> gets closer, it is revealed to be a dilapidated cargo ship.<br/><br/>"Ship Ahoy!" shouts Jimmy. <br/><br/>The ship is completely silent. A Norwegian flag dangles limply over the stern. Captain Hardekker quickly determines that the ship is drifting.<br/><br/>"We must offer assistance," he says.<br/><br/>"What assistance?" demands Francis. "They look fine."<br/><br/>"Well, assistance and salvage."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The former second mate, now acting first mate, is an African named Desmond Motombo. He takes Freddie, Jimmy and Francis over to the drifting cargo ship in one of the launches. They climb up a ladder and stand on the deck.<br/><br/>The silence is eerie only the way a place that normally bustles with activity can become by being absolutely silent.<br/><br/>Francis and Freddie call out, but there's no answer. The deck is pretty messy--equipment is strewn about, indicating that it must have drifted through a storm.<br/><br/>"Let's see if we can find the manifest and log," says Francis. He pulls upon a door into the superstructure at the aft of the ship.<br/><br/>A hideous stench rolls out, the stench of decaying human flesh. Francis jerks back, pale.<br/><br/><i>[OP failed a Stability check here.]</i><br/><br/>The smell is far too prevalent to be only the eight or ten people on a standard steamship crew. With a sinking feeling, Francis begins to suspect that it was involved in human trafficking.<br/><br/>On the second deck, they find their first bodies. The companionway to the bridge is carpeted with dead bodies. Francis examines the corpses. Most have died from blunt force trauma to the head, but some have been stabbed or shot--these are concentrated at the end of the companionway. The door to the bridge is closed. Some bodies look as if they were scratching at the door.<br/><br/>Jimmy notices something very alarming. Most of the people whose heads were bashed in have an ecstatic look on their faces. At the end of the hallway, he finds someone wearing a sailor's cap--possibly a member of the crew. His face is frozen in an expression of pure horror.<br/><br/>"Get some pictures," says Francis to Jimmy.<br/><br/><i>[OP was running this as a crime scene, triaging the bodies--blunt force trauma, GSW...]</i><br/><br/>They drag some bodies down the companionway and out onto the deck, to clear passage to the bridge. The work is incredibly gruesome. The door to the bridge proves to be locked--and barred from the inside.<br/><br/>Francis draws his gun to shoot out the lock, but Freddie grabs his arm. He holds up a prybar. "Might be better, old man."<br/><br/>Jimmy spends some time working on the door but eventually he manages to cut out the lock and push the door out of the frame. Something heavy is blocking it from the inside. He and Francis push hard for a while, and finally a large bookcase crashes to the ground. They crowd into the bridge.<br/><br/><i>[Locksmith determined the door was jammed and barred, Mechanical Repair forced it open, and a four point Athletics spend pushed down the bookcase.]</i><br/><br/>The bridge is hot and stuffy, and reeks of decaying flesh. The ship's crew is here, lying on the deck. The storm shutters are closed across the front windows, and there is no sign of forced entry. <br/><br/>But the crew looks like they were violently torn apart.<br/><br/>Freddie opens the windows, and Francis finds the ship's log. He discovers that the ship sailed from Port Said, traversed the Canal, and then called at Ceylon. From there, they were supposed to head to Cape Town.<br/><br/>And then the log entries skip several days.<br/><br/>After the gap, he finds some entries in handwriting that gets worse and worse. It looks like whoever kept them was trying to figure the position with dead reckoning based on guesswork.<br/><br/>Francis, puzzled, starts to methodically search the desk of the ship's captain. Behind a panel, he finds a hidden manifest. It seems at Ceylon, he took on a large number of passengers--over a hundred. Of course, the ship is not rated for passengers, but they offered a large amount of money. Unusually, they did not give a destination--they said it would be provided en route.<br/><br/>Francis sweeps all of these books into a bag, hoping Captain Hardekker can make something of it.<br/><br/><i>[Pilot is the general purpose Navigation skill here; I'd treat it as an investigative skill for these purposes. But none of the PCs have any.]</i><br/><br/>In one corner, Freddie finds a scrap of yellow silk. Much like the silk the robes he wore in Egypt. To the cult ritual.<br/><br/>They rapidly retreat to the launch. It can't cover the distance between the derelict and the <i>River of Stars</i> quickly enough for them.<br/><br/>"That was a ship of death," Motombo intones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429768/#Comment_429768" name="Item_379" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T11:03:05+00:00" title="March 23, 2014 11:03AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Sea So Deep and Blind (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>The <i>River of Stars</i> raises sail and hurries away from the derelict freighter. Francis delivers the logbooks and manifest to Captain Hardekker. Jimmy wonders if they could sink the ship, but when informed that the way to do that would be to go deep into the hold and open the scuttle valves, he quickly demurs.<br/><br/><i>[So, here's an interesting thing. I threw in the detail about the bridge crew having been torn apart as a little color detail; the kind of thing that happens when you mix cultists with...well, anything. I figured somebody had summoned up a Dimensional Shambler, and that was all there was to know.<br/><br/>But as soon as the PCs were back on the </i>River of Stars<i>, JP began asking about the mechanics of a Cthulhu Mythos spend; I ran them down, noting that there's a way to rebuild Sanity pool loss via psychotherapy. The other players pointed out that there was a psychiatric nurse, a full-blown psychiatrist, and two PCs with points in Psychotherapy traveling with the group. JP decided to risk the spend.<br/><br/>"I'm probably going to regret this, but..." said JP<br/><br/>"--but this is a Cthulhu Mythos game," said FP.<br/><br/>So, Jimmy started to do research. And...I had to make a decision. Figuring out it was a Shambler, hey, that's maybe two points of Stability and on we go. But...JP was </i>interested<i> in this mystery. So...maybe the answer should be more interesting than that. I couldn't decide! So, I decided to just ask the group; how interested were they in this mystery? Did they just want to go on to Australia? Or take the time to explore this a bit. Everyone was non-committal on this question, so I decided to follow my instincts, based on JPs interest, and make the answer more than just a Shambler.</i><br/><br/>Captain Hardekker analyses the logs. It seems the freighter did indeed start heading for Cape Town, but after a while they began to head due south.<br/><br/>"What's south?" asks Francis.<br/><br/>"Nothing. Some small islands. Then Antarctica."<br/><br/>The Captain also is of the opinion that based on <i>when</i> the logs stopped, they probably stopped because the crew was prevented from keeping them--he suspects the ship was taken over. When the log resumes, it's just dead reckoning.<br/><br/>Based on this, the Captain and Francis agree that what seems to have happened is that the crew were overpowered by the passengers at one point--perhaps the crew expressed doubt about where they were headed. At some point after that, the crew seems to have retaken the bridge, and the freighter's captain may have cut the engines to let them drift. Then something got inside the cabin, and killed them all.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Tuesday, 15 September 1925</i><br/><br/>Jimmy "borrows" some books from Charleston. He tries to avoid reading the books themselves, sticking to the meticulous notes kept by Noor before she died. He concentrates on invisible things. There are far more of these than he had believed.<br/><br/>Inspiration strikes; he limits himself to <i>sea-based</i> scary things. This carries him past Noor's detailed notes, past Charleston's extremely <i>disturbing</i> notes. And that leads him to a creature that might be the source of certain sea serpent myths. An alien being, one that is mostly invisible, mostly immaterial, but sometimes manifests as a scaly creature made of mist.<br/><br/>The name of this being is <i>lloigor</i>.<br/><br/>It feeds on the intellectual energy and emotions of sentient beings, draining their vitality while they sleep.<br/><br/>And he feels the clammy grip of fear on him. Because for the last couple of nights, he's woken up feeling...ill. Tired. Like he hadn't rested at all.<br/><br/><i>[Three points of Stability and 1 point of Sanity was the cost of the Mythos spend for poor Jimmy.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy realizes that the the cultists on the ship must have summoned up a lloigor, using a terrible ritual involving human sacrifice and calling upon the Dread Name of Azathoth and Nyarlathotep. And that this creature is now on <i>their</i> ship.<br/><br/>"What ho, Jimmy!" says Freddie, sticking his head in the cabin.<br/><br/>"Freddie, how have you been sleeping?" pants Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Well, to be honest I don't think shipboard life suits me. I get these damned headaches." <br/><br/><i>[I charged everyone two points of Health loss because of the lloigor's activities.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy drags Freddie to Francis. <br/><br/>"Everything okay, Jimmy?" <br/><br/>Jimmy relates what he found out in a single run-on sentence.<br/><br/>"This is not something we can't deal with," says Francis.<br/><br/>Jimmy explains that it must use its own vitality to manipulate the outside world, which is why these creatures tend to stay invisible. It can be forced to take on material form...if he can only locate the right spell.<br/><br/>The <i>River of Stars</i> has become a haunted ship.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429769/#Comment_429769" name="Item_380" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T11:04:42+00:00" title="March 23, 2014 11:04AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Sea So Deep and Blind (Part 6)</b><br/><br/><i>Wednesday, 16 September 1925</i><br/><br/>A yard collapses with a man on it; he is able to grab a rope, but the sail falls to the deck. Captain Hardekker is told that there may be some kind of "brain fever" that made everyone on the freighter kill each other.<br/><br/>"During the duration of this emergency, I'll be giving the orders," Francis says.<br/><br/>"What! That's mutiny! The rules of the sea won't allow me to concede control of my ship while I am master."<br/><br/>Francis glances back at the fallen yard, then fixes the captain with a mournful gaze.<br/><br/>"...however, if you can take care of this matter, I'll make sure you have no other duties...and I'd welcome your advice..." Hardekker finishes.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance use by OP.]</i><br/><br/>The ship reduces sail, to give them some time to deal with the situation. Francis institutes a buddy system. Despite this, accidents begin to happen.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Freddie ask Melissa to wake Charleston up while giving him just enough tranquilizers to keep him from raving and screaming. They go down into the sickbay, and find Charleston propped up in a bed, arms and legs in restraints. He seems preternaturally calm.<br/><br/><i>[As mentioned above, CP wasn't at this session, so I had some qualms about them interrogating his PC. I finally decided that I had a GMs out for this one: just because the lights were on, it doesn't mean that Charleston was the one who was home...in other words, we don't know who was speaking with Charleston's mouth.]</i><br/><br/>"Hello, Freddie."<br/><br/>"Hello, Charleston. We're here to ask your expertise."<br/><br/>"About...the creature?"<br/><br/>"Yes...can you tell me about this creature."<br/><br/>"It will drain you of vitality. It will probably take a long time. That way it can <i>enjoy</i> it more."<br/><br/>"How can we make it manifest?"<br/><br/>Charleston slowly swivels his head to face Jimmy. "I think Jimmy wants to know. Are you going to cast some black magic, Jimmy? It's the only way. It's a shame Dr. Mwimbe took the <i>Al-Azif</i> from me. I could have cast a spell...I know exactly where it is..."<br/><br/>"Are you saying Dr. Mwimbe could do this?" asks Freddie.<br/><br/>"But if you look in the <i>Liber Ivonis</i>, most of the ritual is there. Noor knew. Check her index. Such a shame about her, don't you think?"<br/><br/>"Who exactly are you, and why are you helping us?" demands Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I'm Charleston."<br/><br/>"No you're not."<br/><br/>"<i>Charleston</i> has always been helpful," says Freddie firmly. "Right Jimmy?"<br/><br/>A sneer briefly breaks across Charleston's face. "Little Jimmy, playing by the seashore. You're afraid of the big scary sea monster, aren't you? Run along, now, Jimmy. Go play."<br/><br/>Thoroughly unnerved, Jimmy and Freddie begin to leave. As Freddie is going through the doorway, Charleston speaks one last time.<br/><br/>"Oh, Freddie? I can't say I like your chances. But I wish you luck."<br/><br/><i>[I've always liked Ian Holm's final line in Alien.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie drops in on Dr. Mwimbe. "I had an interesting conversation with Charleston."<br/><br/>"That sounds like a terrible idea."<br/><br/>"Yes, well, he mentioned your name. It seems we have a creature on board--what's the name of it, Jimmy?"<br/><br/>"The lloigor," says Dr. Mwimbe before Jimmy can say anything. "Yes, I know."<br/><br/>"Could you make it manifest?"<br/><br/>"No, I do not know that spell."<br/><br/>"Could you help Jimmy?"<br/><br/>"Help Jimmy? <i>Jimmy</i> is casting spells now?"<br/><br/>"Either that or release Charleston..."<br/><br/>"That would be a terrible idea! I didn't want to say anything while he was more conscious, but he really scared me! That's why I took the book away. I was terrified he was going to say something horrible in front of the Sultan and ruin my reputation among my own people.. How long until we reach Australia?"<br/><br/>"At this rate, never."<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Friday, 18 September 1925</i><br/><br/>Jimmy, of course, does not speak Latin. Freddie does. (So does Francis, but he's conveniently forgotten his altar boy and med school Latin.) Dr. Mwimbe does as well, but she does not wish to, as she says, weaken her will by reading more occult books. She's happy to add Jimmy as a patient, however.<br/><br/>Jimmy quickly locates the spell, and with Freddie's help they translate a description of the creature in its material form--the <i>forma dracona</i>, in dog Latin. It will appear first as a heavy fog, then a serpentine dragonlike form, with claws and teeth and a really thick hide. <br/><br/><i>[Freddie and Jimmy both got a point of Cthulhu Mythos for reading the </i>Liber Ivonis<i>.]</i><br/><br/>There's no <i>specific</i> ritual to force the creature, but he finds two spells that are perhaps useful: the <i>Vach Viraj</i> incantation, and another ritual with Noor's notes written all over them--in Arabic. Jimmy goes to Dr. Mwimbe.<br/><br/>"Oh yes...very interesting...very interesting indeed," mutters the doctor. "Shame that she died."<br/><br/>She explains that this is a ritual called the <i>Saaamaaa Ritual</i>, which is used to shield areas from entities from other space-times. "I am surprised she got this far," she says. "There are eight lines, but not all are known. It seems that she found at least the first two...maybe the third line as well."<br/><br/><i>[This is foreshadowing of my plans for winding up the campaign.]</i><br/><br/>They make plans. No one is willing to risk the <i>River of Stars</i> to the depredations of a manifested lloigor. Francis speaks to the captain, and the ship turns back, heading towards the derelict freighter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429793/#Comment_429793" name="Item_381" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T22:16:29+00:00" title="March 23, 2014 10:16PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks, Mel!

The next day they should reach the derelict freighter and he is frantically trying to learn some spells to help them.<br/><br/>Dr. Mwimbe enters his room. "James, I can tell you something that will make this ritual much easier for you."<br/><br/>"Why do I get the feeling it will be something I don't like?"<br/><br/>"It will probably not be easy for you...but it will make it much easier to perform the ceremony."<br/><br/>"Will I have to sacrifice someone?"<br/><br/>"...We can talk about that. Sacrifice is power, James. Look at this creature, the lloigor. It draws its power from the living. There is an incantation you can make. I can teach it to you right now. And it will make all sorts of magic easier for you."<br/><br/>"What does it do?"<br/><br/>"You merely...ask the favor of magic-granting gods."<br/><br/>"Would it be like performing a contract?"<br/><br/>"Yes. I happen to have a sample of the contract right here." She flips open a long scroll with obscure Latin writing on it.<br/><br/>Jimmy starts. This seems like Mwimbe. In fact, she's like the most Mwimbe he's ever seen her, as if she was the perfect image of Mwimbe.<br/><br/><i>Nobody's the perfect image of themselves</i>, Jimmy thinks. Out loud, he says, "Mwimbe's still in her room, isn't she?"<br/><br/>"I am right here."<br/><br/>"You're not Mwimbe..."<br/><br/>"Who am I then, James?"<br/><br/>Jimmy looks into her eyes. He realizes they are totally black...no whites, no iris...nothing.<br/><br/>"C'mon, Jimmy," says Mwimbe in a bantering tone. "Make a deal with me. I can take care of this critter for you. I mean, what are you going to do for the ritual? You'll need blood. You gonna cut the throats of everyone in the crew? They wouldn't like that, and I don't think you'd like yourself after. Make a deal. Take a shortcut, I deal in shortcuts. Jimmy. I didn't hurt you in the clearing because I <i>like</i> you.  Freddie I can take or leave, and Francis...well, Francis will take care of himself. But you...I mean, it's not like you're going to win, but I admire that you're still in there, pitching. You're like one of them, what, big damn heroes. I like it when monkeys stand up on their hind legs and act like they're people and everything. It's cute. You're like a cat."<br/><br/>"You've just called me a monkey, a cat, and cute."<br/><br/>"I can't decide what you remind me of the most. I think there's a little of me in all of you. You're like the rabbit in those cartoons, the one that blows things up and everybody laughs...oh wait...you're in 1925...well, you're gonna love them if you live. I love the rabbit! I don't know, he reminds me of somebody."<br/><br/>"I'm not sure I can trust--"<br/><br/>"Oh, I always keep my contracts. Why would I want to hurt you? Come on, one-time offer, no strings attached. Tick tock, tick tock. Time's a-wasting."<br/><br/>Jimmy notices that the clock on the wall seems to have stopped.<br/><br/>"Come on," continues the entity wearing Mwimbe's form. "You really think you're gonna pull this off? By being all sneaky? You don't think the <i>invisible creature</i> hasn't heard about it? Or that <i>somebody</i> might tell him?"<br/><br/>The entity chuckles horribly.<br/><br/>"Well...I...um...I want to save everyone on the ship...I don't think I want to become anything that might destroy the world..."<br/><br/>"Waitaminute. Are you saying <i>no</i> to me? Because the last person to say no to me? That was Chuckles. Look what happened to him. Well, all right." It peels out a business card from the thin air. "Here's my card. Call me any time. Day or night. Operators are standing by, James!"<br/><br/>The numbers on the card are constantly changing.<br/><br/>"I'll...keep it in mind."<br/><br/>"Oh, and Jimmy? You know you're the rest of the rabbit. See you in the funny papers, kid."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy huddles in the corner, shaken. And as if on cue, all the books on the table levitate up in the air and start swirling around, smashing into the walls of the cabin. The lamp goes out, plunging the room into darkness. Jimmy begins to shriek.<br/><br/><i>[5 point Mythos shock as the lloigor tries to scare/kill Jimmy.]</i><br/><br/>Francis, a few cabins down the companionway, hears a high pitched screaming that can only be Jimmy--or, as he will discover in the 1930s, the actress Myrna Loy. He bursts into Jimmy's cabin. Just before he does, the books and papers not only stop swirling in the air--they land back on the table exactly where they were before levitating.<br/><br/>"Jimmy!" barks Francis. "Where's your buddy? Everybody has to be in twos."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry Francis..."<br/><br/>"Let's go find your buddy." (Jimmy's buddy is Freddie, of course.)<br/><br/>"I saw him...he talked to me...he gave me his card..."<br/><br/>"Sure, Jimmy." Francis looks at the card. It's absolutely black on both sides. <br/><br/>"The creature <i>knows</i>, Francis. It's <i>pointless</i>."<br/><br/>"There's nothing out there we can't handle. I need you to be making traps the tomorrow. We've been through hell and back, you and me."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SilentW" title="SilentW"><img alt="SilentW" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/845/nXILUDB2SRWUB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SilentW">SilentW</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430544/#Comment_430544" name="Item_384" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T13:08:31+00:00" title="April  4, 2014  1:08PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2014 1:08PM by SilentW.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, man, this is intense!

Everyone feels more and more tired, and a malaise grips the crew, who whisper among themselves that the ship has a poltergeist.<br/><br/>Francis gives Motumbo, the first mate, a gun. "There's two bullets. One for you, and one for the captain. If the crew goes crazy and starts killing people, use them."<br/><br/><i>[Me: You seem to have a remarkable ability to demoralize all the NPCs, OP.]</i><br/><br/>They reach the derelict freighter. Francis descends into the hold to retrieve supplies, while Jimmy and Freddie prepare some traps. They already know the spell will work much better after sunset, and steel themselves for the conflict.<br/><br/><i>[So the way I ended up running this was to tell the PCs: if you guys agree to not try and "hit the win button", you can trust me to run this fairly on my end--so, rather than go through a long amount of preparations and planning, let's just run this out and you can tell me what you've done as we do the scene. I was more interested in getting a good dramatic conflict than worrying about whether or not they could find a 2 X 4 on the derelict.]</i><br/><br/>The problem arises of finding people to contribute blood for the ritual.<br/><br/><i>[It requires either Health or Stability to pay off the spell; they need the help of the crew. I got cruel and told them they could get one volunteer for every two points of an interpersonal ability they spent. Luckily for the PCs, they have a lot of skills.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy and Freddie make impassioned speeches, asking for volunteers to join them in fighting this demon. Freddie, of course, has a silver tongue developed in years of talking his way past gendarmes, and before they know what they've agreed to, two men have joined them.<br/><br/>Jimmy talks to an Australian he's grown friendly with. "Listen, I don't know if I'm going to get out of this, so, could you please make sure these letters get to my sis in Paris?"<br/><br/>Eyes swimming, the Australian grabs his arm. "I can't let you go alone, mate," he says, and joins up with the other two crewmen.<br/><br/><i>[Three crewmembers were able to contribute a total of 10 points of Stability.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>They make their way over to the cargo ship. Francis has turned on the arc lights, and their buzzing and sparks fill the air with an ozone smell. Jimmy has lit some torches, because the book recommended torches.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Freddie begin to chant the Vach-Viraj incantation: <br/><br/><i>\u201cYa na kadishtu nilgh\u2019ri<br/>stell-bsna Nyogtha; K\u2019yarnak<br/>phlegethor l\u2019ebumna sya\u2019h<br/>n\u2019ghft. Ya hai kadishtu ep<br/>r\u2019luh-eeh Nyogtha eeh, S\u2019uhnngh<br/>athg li\u2019hee orr\u2019e syha\u2019h,\u201d<br/></i><br/><br/>The crew follow along. Suddenly, Jimmy and Freddie's voices lock into unison, ringing out clearly into the night. A cold mist begins to roll over the ship, obscuring everything. Francis' mind reels as voices seem to whisper disturbingly in the swirling air.<br/><br/>The mist begins to condense. The arc lights explode in a shower of sparks. In the dimness of the starlight and torchlight, something can be seen taking form. <br/><br/>A great, black, coiled serpent curled around the mast.<br/><br/><i>"What did you say?"</i> demands a cold, inhuman voice that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. <i>"Say it again, and </i>mean<i> it this time."</i><br/><br/>"Buddy system, go!" shouts Francis. The three crewmen pull out slingshots and fire little jars of nitroglycerin at the serpent.<br/><br/><i>[Retroactive Pharmacy spend by Francis. Yeah, he knew how to make nitro for "medicinal" purposes.]</i><br/><br/>The jars explode against the scaly hide of the monster, but don't seem to do much damage. The three crewmen hurry over the side o the ship and slide down the ladder into a waiting launch.<br/><br/>Francis runs up into the superstructure and cocks the elephant gun he had left there.<br/><br/>The serpent roars and the great mouth clamps on Freddie's arm. It tosses him across the deck. Jimmy yanks on a quick release line, and one of the crane booms slips out of its clamps and crashes into the serpent.<br/><br/><i>[Mechanical Repair and Preparedness from JP.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie bounces back up, shouts some dirty words in Aklo, and starts to run down the deck. The lloigor screams in rage and slithers after him.<br/><br/>Up on the balcony of the superstructure, Francis cranks a detonator and presses the trigger. An explosive at the base of the mast detonates, and the mask comes crashing towards the deck. As Freddie leaps up onto some coiled ropes, Francis hits a second switch and the net of cables he laid on the deck surges with the last dregs of the marine batteries. As the mast is about to crash into the serpent, it dissolves momentarily into mist. The mast hits the deck with a thud. The lloigor reforms on top of it, chuckling.<br/><br/><i>[Mechanical repair, plus a Reassurance spend to have had some one on the ship with Electrical Repair rig up the cabling. Sadly, OP rolled a 1 on 1d6 +4, barely scratching the critter. Since I want failure to mean that something unexpected happened, I threw in the bit about the dissolve. Then to be fair, I docked the lloigor Health, which it needs to spend in order to manifest.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy picks himself up from where he had fallen after receiving some of the electrical shock. He draws his sawed-off shotgun and blasts the serpent in the nose at close range. The serpent swivels around its head, forgetting Freddie and slithering towards Jimmy.<br/><br/>Freddie draws the enormous revolver Francis had loaned him and empties it into the creature. Bullets ricochet off of the iron-hard scales of the creature.<br/><br/>Up on the superstructure, Francis draws a bead on the eye of the serpent. He fires both barrels of the elephant gun in a single shot. Blood and ichor spray out from the serpent, steaming in the night. The lloigor screams in pain and rage. It rolls around in obvious agony.<br/><br/><i>"You...think...you...have...won..."</i> it moans, and then chuckles madly. It begins to chant. There's a feeling of ozone in the air, like just before a thunderstorm.<br/><br/>Jimmy sudden remembers that the lloigor can create a massive implosion effect.<br/><br/>He turns to run. Freddie looks up. "J--"<br/><br/><i>WHUMP.</i><br/><br/>Mist and steam fill the night. Jimmy is yanked backwards off his feet. Freddie vanishes into the cloud of mist.<br/><br/>Gradually a sea breeze dissipates the fog. Jimmy is staggering around, holding his ears. The ship looks like someone has hit it with an enormous ball-peen hammer, crumbling a large section of the deck and hull together. Freddie is in the center of the crater, jagged pieces of metal jutting from his body.<br/><br/>There is no trace of the monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis summons the <i>River of Stars</i> by firing a flare. They row Freddie carefully back to the ship, Francis working frantically to stabilize him. Jimmy rubs his broken nose.<br/><br/>They manage to get Freddie into the sickbay. Francis spends several hours turning into a suitable operating theater. Crewmembers line up to donate blood.<br/><br/>"Did you win?" asks Charleston, tonelessly. Melissa sedates him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430660/#Comment_430660" name="Item_388" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T20:43:07+00:00" title="April  7, 2014  8:43PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Sea So Deep and Blind (Part 9)</b><br/><br/>Francis performs emergency surgery successfully on Freddie, and soon he is convalescing nicely. The <i>River of Stars</i> finds favorable winds and is soon moving with impressive speed towards Melbourne.<br/><br/><i>Tuesday, 30 September 1925</i><br/><br/>"Landfall tomorrow," says Francis.<br/><br/>"Good," says Freddie, standing somewhat stiffly near a porthole. "You know old man, I've been thinking. My whole life, I've had this damned bad luck. And I've been wondering...maybe it's because I've kept trying to shirk away from, you know, <i>dealing</i> with things. Maybe...maybe there are things a man just has to <i>do</i>, you know. Maybe I'm on the damned uncomfortable adventure because...there's something I'm supposed to take care of. Don't you agree, old man?"<br/><br/>He never notices Francis had already left.<br/><br/><i>[FP surprised the hell out of me by changing his drive to Duty. We speculated that maybe the other Blakelys weren't such horrid reprobates, which led me to finally ask what the story of Freddie's dead parents was. Turns out that FP had misread me--I don't mess with PC backgrounds unless invited--and had wanted me to use it as a hook.<br/><br/>Not long after I hit upon an idea that finally explains why M was so interested in Freddie, but that doesn't come in until Episode XV.]</i><br/><br/><i>Monday, 1 October 1925</i><br/><br/>The <i>River of Stars</i> finally staggers into Melbourne harbor. Francis and Captain Hardekker immediately tell the story of the derelict freighter, leaving out all the supernatural details. There is a quick inquest, but between the two of them, they manage to deflect any further interest in the ship.<br/><br/>The main leads they have are to the Randolph Shipping Company, located...somewhere, in Australia. Jimmy asks Duggars, his Australian shipmate about where to look. "Are they in Eastern or Western Australia?" asks Duggars.<br/><br/>"Um...where's Port Hedland?"<br/><br/>"West. Not much up there, mostly mineral extraction."<br/><br/>"Is there anything we could...help fix? Any trouble?" asks Francis.<br/><br/>"Plenty of trouble. Go out to the outback, pull  a Ned Kelly."<br/><br/>Blank faces.<br/><br/>"He's like a whatdyecallem, an outlaw."<br/><br/>"Oh."<br/><br/>"You're probably best off heading to Sydney, if you want to do research, and then take a steamer to the west. Unless you can find some daft cove to fly you there."<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Monday, October 5 1925</i><br/><br/>Sydney proves to be a bustling colonial city. Francis, Jimmy and Freddie spread out to research whatever they can find about any local cult activity.<br/><br/>Francis heads down to the Territorial Police. "People go missing all the time," says the corporal on duty. "Did'ye know that Australia has five of the most poisonous snakes in the world? I like when you Yanks come down under. D'ye like baseball, Mr. O'Donnell? Can't figure that out at all--too many arcane rules. Not like cricket--that's straightforward. In any case, I'd advise you to go down the University, talk to a Dr. David Dodge."<br/><br/>"Thanks."<br/><br/>"Oh, and if you do go out in the bush, watch out for the drop bears. Very vicious."<br/><br/>"Drop...bears?"<br/><br/>"Yeah, they're awful crafty. Drop out of trees if you're not wary. Drop bears. G'day."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy drops in on a French restaurant, where he meets Guy Forgeron, who has travelled ahead of them.<br/><br/>"Bon jour, Guy."<br/><br/>"\xc7a va, Jimmy!"<br/><br/>"Uh..bien?"<br/><br/>"Hey, good! Have a nice trip? Get a lot of rest? I mean you look...you look...you look like hell, man."<br/><br/>They have a light lunch. It starts at one o'clock and they are mostly done with the third bottle of wine by three o'clock. Francis joins them in time for brandy. Guy has brought a box of stuff from Francis' apartment in Montmartre, including the last record his wife Isabelle recorded. He tells him that he picked them up right before he took his family to R\xe9union. <br/><br/>"So what are you hunting now, Fran\xe7ois? I heard you took care of Gavigan. You just let me know, okay? You took care of me when I needed it, man. I'm with you to the end."<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Tuesday, 6 October 1925</i><br/><br/>"I'm sorry, we can't let you look at the stacks, Mr. Wright," says the pretty young librarian at the University. "But...you said you're an archaeologist?"<br/><br/>"Indeed I am."<br/><br/>"I've never met one so...dashing."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery use by JP.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy spends most of the day at the library, occasionally being served tea by the librarian. He discovers that the Randolph Shipping company is near a part of the Great Sandy Desert where there are rumors...tenuous rumors, but frequently repeated...of a great, ancient city buried in the sands.<br/><br/>A city that predates the inhabitation of Australia by thousands of years.<br/><br/>He also finds out that the legends say the city was built by the gods, and destroyed by the wind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Guy and Francis hit the University of Sydney, where they eventually track down Dr. Dodge, a strapping ginger-haired man in his 30s. He definitely seems like a field archaeologist.<br/><br/>"Occult activities?" says Dodge, after the preliminaries. "Like that Margaret Murray lady, with her witch cult? Oh, modern-day cults. I thought those were pretty rare."<br/><br/>"They seem to be making a comeback. Especially the suicidal ones."<br/><br/>"Well, Dr. O'Donnell, there's one I know about, the Cult of the Sand Bat. Aboriginal cult, worships something they call the Father of All Bats. Lives in the darkness, hates the light, that sort of thing. I've been hearing rumors that they seem to be more active than they have in a long time. A colleague--mentor, really--of mine is more interested in this sort of thing. Professor Anthony Cowles. I could see if you could come by for dinner."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie hits the Australia Museum. He learns a lot about native animals, and native artefacts. One exhibit intrigues him--a painting of a bat with a strange, three-lobed eye. He remembers, from one of Charleston's books he read on the ship, that Nyarlat-hotep is rumored to have such a form.<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos use by FP.]</i><br/><br/>In the National Art Museum, he finds a painting of people hitting a bleeding man with clubs. The docent explains that it shows a ritual of a bat worshipping cult.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Professor Cowles lives in a suburban bungalow--an energetic, bushy-bearded man in middle-age. His rather attractive daughter Ewa greets them at the door. They have a pleasant dinner, and then brandy and smokes. Somewhat surprisingly, Ewa stays to drink with them.<br/><br/>"So, David tells me you're interested in the cult of the Sand-Bat. They're quite curious, actually. You see, all of the Koori cultures in Australia worship the Rainbow Serpent--its got a great deal of linguistic and cultural significance. But the Sand-Bat cult rejects the Rainbow Serpent in favor of their god."<br/><br/>He holds out a small, battered leatherbound book. "This is a diary of a colleague of mine, MacWhirr. Went out prospecting in the Great Sandy Desert. Let me read you some excerpts..."\n<blockquote><br/>Mar. 23\u2014We have discovered what appears to be remnants of an ancient city, rising from the shifting sands! I believe I have secured several good photographs of this amazing find, though the heat has ruined all but six of my photographic plates. By the pitting of the stone, the blocks and pillars appear to be more than 10,000 years old! Incredible!<br/><br/>Mar. 24\u2014Four camels killed in the attack last night. I saw at least two abos, and more must have been skulking out there. I\u2019m sure I hit one. That ends this trip\u2014we\u2019ll have to head back to Cuncudgerie and report this incident.<br/><br/>More than men were out there last night. I saw shapes much bigger than men during the attack. My evidence is the body of Old Sam<br/>the camel, punctured and scraped is the best way I can described the remains, just like poor Jock. Since the attack lasted only a couple of minutes, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that anything human could have done so much damage so quickly. But then what was it?</blockquote>\n"MacWhirr was a geologist, and a good one," says Dodge. "I believe his story. And all this happened in the northwest--the same place antiquities have begun to be shipped out of."<br/><br/>"It would be terrible if Australia lost them," says Francis levelly.<br/><br/>"Indeed. They belong here, and too the Kooris, really. I suppose it might pay to go up that way. There's an industrialist in the area, an American chap--Noah Cross is his name."<br/><br/>"I think it would pay to have an academic with us, to act as a guide," says Francis.<br/><br/>"I can't go myself," says Professor Cowles, "as I have to look after Ewa. But David should be free to head up your way."<br/><br/><br/><i>Wednesday, 7 October 1925</i><br/><br/>The next day, they catch a mail steamer bound for Western Australia. Dodge is indeed happy to travel with them--he eagerly looks forward to exploring the ruins in the desert.<br/><br/>Of course, so is Miss Ewa Cowles, who is just as eager to head off for adventure and has easily given her father the slip.<br/><br/>The coastline slips past them as they head into the setting sun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430917/#Comment_430917" name="Item_389" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-13T20:07:15+00:00" title="April 13, 2014  8:07PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIV: A Brand New Me (Part </b>)<br/><br/><i>Friday,  9 October 1925</i><br/><br/><i>[So, FP was out this session, but CP returned, with his new PC, the Reverend James Jones.

I understand you're a private investigator...well, it seems Mr. Charleston has escaped. I don't know how...he has been taking his drugs...but he must have slipped off when we were docked earlier."<br/><br/>Francis searches Charleston's cabin. It is a rather spartan room; the only interesting features are the restraints Miss Ford installed. Looking at them, Francis realizes they've been picked. "Some one let him go," he says.<br/><br/>"Who would want to release him?" asks Miss Ford. "Not to be rude, but your friend's chances of recovery are not good."<br/><br/>They check in with Dr. Mwimbe. "Mr. O'Donnell, I'm afraid I'm quite busy," she says through her door.<br/><br/>"Charleston's loose."<br/><br/>"I'll come right out."<br/><br/>His books, the doctor explains, have been secured in her cabin. She also opines that Charleston might have been able to pick the locks himself--as if he had some sort of supernatural assistance.<br/><br/>"Does he have any of his books?"<br/><br/>"No. I would know. I keep watch over all our most powerful artifacts. Although I am now finding my amusement being replaced by a supernatural dread. I would be remiss if I did not mention that the Dark Lord has long has his eye upon Charleston. This disappearance may be linked to that interest."<br/><br/>Francis searches Charleston's room again. He finds the violin case. Inside it is...a regular Thompson gun, disassembled. He asks the captain to place a radio call to have an all points bulletin out for Charleston.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Sunday, 18 October 1925</i><br/><br/>They finally make landfall at Port Hedland, Western Australia. The town is a railroad terminus on the edge of the Great Sandy Desert. It's a dusty frontier village bustling with gold prospectors and miners.<br/><br/>A crowd of drovers, longshoremen, and overseers greets them as they get off the boat, in an angry mood. "It's those bloody [racial slurs]," one tells Francis. "None of 'em showed up for work today. Some new preacher showed up from the States, preachin' the world of God to them. Probably a Papist, wears a big crucifix."<br/><br/>Melissa approaches Francis. "I'm afraid that with Charleston gone, I'm a bit superfluous. Are you going to send me back to England?"<br/><br/>"I don't have the means. Welcome to Australia. Mind the snakes."<br/><br/>"This is a bit of a spot...I haven't been in anything like this since the war. Did you fight in the war?"<br/><br/>"Do I look like a coward? I was in France and Russia, after."<br/><br/>"Are you married, Mr. O'Donnell? You wear a ring but never talk about a wife."<br/><br/>"She's...passed on."<br/><br/>"Oh. A bit like my young man, James. Died in the Somme. Before we could get married."<br/><br/><br/><br/>They head out for one of the few hotels near the waterfront. They pass a large crowd of Koori and Indian workers. They can hear someone shouting, some kind of sermon.<br/><br/>Francis notices that a cordon of white men with a suspiciously large amount of axe handles and two by fours is slowly surrounding the crowd.<br/><br/>On top of a number of crates, his back to Francis and company, is a short man dressed all in black, with a black broad-brimmed hat. He is wearing black gloves, gesticulating wildly as he preaches a somewhat eccentric sermon about how Jesus Christ saw the suffering of the gods on Olympus. He climbed the mountain, slew Typhon, and carried his head down the mountain in one fist. As he descended, he gave pointers to the gods on how to live.<br/><br/>"And that was the Sermon on the Mount, brothers and sisters!" he proclaims.<br/><br/>Francis asks Jimmy to stay behind and watch what happens. By the time the rest of them reach the hotel, they can hear the sounds of rioting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430948/#Comment_430948" name="Item_390" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-14T08:09:27+00:00" title="April 14, 2014  8:09AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw.

"Jesus is our Savior! If that's the kind of Christian you are!"<br/><br/>"Listen, Yank," shouts back one of the white me. "You're not even preaching from the real Bible! You're using some American translation. Now tell them all to get back to work! This isn't time for preaching! It's Sunday morning!"<br/><br/>"Let me tell you what my...bibble?"<br/><br/>"Bible!"<br/><br/>"I don't know how it's pronounced in Australia. Anyway, it says that those who do not work, do not eat. So if you're hungry, go back to work. Thanks folks, I'm doing three shows a day."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by the Rev.]</i><br/><br/>The crowd begins to disperse. Another minister makes his way to Jones. "A brother of the cloth!" he shouts and crushes the newcomer in a bearhug.<br/><br/>"I'm afraid I'm a Methodist! We don't do hugs!" sputters the man. "Reverend Smythe."<br/><br/>"James Warren Jones. Call me Brother Jones. From West Virginia, in the U S of A."<br/><br/>"I...wouldn't have guessed that...sorry, pure parochialism on my part."<br/><br/>"Never seen a black preacher before?"<br/><br/>"I...I'm rather confused. But I think it's all to the best if we don't have a repeat of this kind of incident. We have a little chapel for the Aborigines that we run on Saturdays. Perhaps we could meet beforehand...to discuss your sermon. Where are you staying?"<br/><br/>"Wherever the Lord takes me."<br/><br/>"Well, one of the local magnates has established a house for the indigent. A wonderful American, full of Christian charity. Just go down and ask for the Noah Cross House."<br/><br/>"That name seems somewhat familiar...well, thank you. I'll be sure to do that."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis goes out with Ewa to search for the crazy preacher he saw. He doesn't worry that Jimmy didn't come back; Jimmy can take care of himself, he reasons. He finds a bar named Holden's, which seems popular with miners.<br/><br/>"You do take a girl to all the best places," mutters Ewa.<br/><br/>"Come over here, I'll show you me gold claim," says a miner, grabbing her and throwing her onto the lap of a companion.<br/><br/>Francis kicks the man's kneecap, crushing it with a sickening noise. The three other miners flip over the table and rush at Francis.<br/><br/>He ducks the first attack, but then is grabbed from behind and clocked in the jaw. Francis smacks him hard in the gut and he collapses. The other two look at their fallen companions and then quickly back out. The bartender motions to his Koori floor cleaners to cart out the mess.<br/><br/>"Have a beer," says the publican. Ewa orders a whisky. <br/><br/>Francis asks about the preacher. "Oh, the [racial slur] who preaches to the [racial slurs]. Something seems a bit off about his sermons, but I never went to Sunday school."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Noah Cross Home is a nicely kept white clapboard house in a better neighborhood of Port Hedland. "Preacher man," says the Koori groundskeeper. "Beware. The Sand Bat is returning!" He saunters away before Jones can ask him any questions. Shrugging, he knocks on the door to the house.<br/><br/>"Normally trade goes to the back entrance," says a woman in a high-collared dress. "Oh. Sorry, you're that preacher! We don't allow any preaching, but if you are looking for a place to stay...Brother Smythe sent you? What a nice man. Methodist, but no accounting for taste."<br/><br/>She takes him into a dormitory room--cots set up around the sides of the building. "Are you an American?"<br/><br/>"Indeed. You can tell from the accent, and the complexion I'm sure. A state called West Virginia."<br/><br/>"Ah, they have a Virginia on the West Coast now? Commendable. We are non-denominational here, and do readings during dinner."<br/><br/>"May I have some parchment?

He hears some stories about the Sand-Bat cult, and how bodies have been found in the desert, covered with little pucker wounds. He also hears that some "Yanks" have been digging up all the gold fields--or at least, digging up something--the Aborigines say something about a buried city, but that's surely crazy.<br/><br/>Francis is neutrally non-committal, but he notices that one miner who has been paying attention to him all night slips out the door as soon as the rumors about the city start being floated.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble roll by OP.]</i><br/><br/>"Ewa, go follow that guy," says Francis. The young woman gamely goes blundering off after the miner, who easily manages to lose her--but Francis has been using her as a distraction, to try and fool his mark that he has thrown off pursuers.<br/><br/>He is closing on the miner when he hears Ewa's muffled screams. Cursing, he takes off in that direction and finds two Kooris dragging Ewa down an alley.<br/><br/>Francis fires off a warning shot. The Kooris drop Ewa, but one draws a club and prepares to take a swipe at her. Francis drill him with his revolver, and the Koori drops the club and runs away.<br/><br/>"Kooris don't usually act like that," says Ewa.<br/><br/>"Kooris?"<br/><br/>"That's the proper term. I'm not a racialist."<br/><br/>The club, once they get back to their hotel and examine it, proves to be somewhat unusual--it has teeth embedded in it. Francis takes a closer look.<br/><br/>They are bat teeth. Except, of course, that they are far too large. Something else troubles him about the teeth, but he can't put his finger on it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"We have a special guest tonight, my brothers and sisters," says the sister. "Our benefactor, Mr. Noah Cross, has come to visit us."<br/><br/>A man in an ice-cream suit addresses the gathered itinerants at the Noah Cross House. "My friends, it is so wonderful to see you all tonight. Please listen to sister while she reads to you, and I will be happy to talk with any of you who wish to speak to me during dinner." He regards the Reverend Jones somewhat strangely.<br/><br/><i>[Obviously, Noah Cross is played by John Huston. I tried my best to do a John Huston impression--it is </i>not<i> easy.]</i><br/><br/>During dinner, Jones sits down next to Mr. Cross. "Have we met?" says Cross.<br/><br/>"Jim Warren Jones. I'm visiting from Australia. I don't think we've met, but thank you so much for giving me a place to rest my head--"<br/><br/>"Jones, is it? What an interesting turn of events. I met a man not dissimilar to you once...in his own way, he was an evangelist."<br/><br/>"Oh? Do you meet many black men of the cloth?"<br/><br/>"Black man, you say? No, except for the Abo...the Kooris. Sister tells me you have an interest in preaching to the natives. Are you here with your friends?"<br/><br/>"All mankind is my friend, but I've not made the acquaintance of everyone yet, so I am afraid I am travelling alone."<br/><br/>"Interesting--I thought I'd heard...well, no matter. Mr--uh, Reverend..."<br/><br/>"Please, brother will do just fine."<br/><br/>"Brother, I would be very honored if you would come out to our work in the desert and spread your message of benevolence and love to my employees. Many are natives, but I think even the white men would benefit from your experience."<br/><br/>"You are everything I could have hoped for and more."<br/><br/>"You are quite a surprise as well. We are a mining concern, and we've found some interesting geological structures in the desert. You will not mind if we ask you not to reveal our location."<br/><br/>"There is only one God, and we are guided by him."<br/><br/>"I couldn't agree more. Do you know anyone else who might be worthy of such an opportunity. I'll see you at my office tomorrow. Something is happening, Mr. Jones, but I don't know what it is. It will be a great deal of fun to find out though."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Monday, 19 October 1925</i><br/><br/>Francis heads down to the waterfront to check out the Randolph Shipping Company. He finds are rather slovenly looking Aussie giving orders to some Kooris.<br/><br/>"Was wondering if you were doing any work for Noah Cross."<br/><br/>"Noah Cross? Bleeding rich Yank."<br/><br/>"Yeah. Well, we've been tracking some things..."<br/><br/>Francis notices a crate being carried by some Kooris. Painted on the side is "Fondation Aubrey Penhew, Paris."<br/><br/>"...like that crate. Who's that for?"<br/><br/>"I'll have to check the manifest."<br/><br/>Francis crosses his arm and smiles. He thinks its friendly, although most people would take it to be menacing.<br/><br/>After a while, Randolph gulps and searches his papers. "It says, 'Artefact.'"<br/><br/>"That's it? Well, I hope it's not some kind of illegal transit."<br/><br/>"What are you on about, Yank? What authority do you have here."<br/><br/>"I'm from Paris, actually."<br/><br/>"You're French? Let me see some identification."<br/><br/>Francis hands over his French PI license. Randolph shrugs, and calls over a Koori named Billy. They open the crate, and Francis sees a grotesque humanoid idol, obviously Koori made. It has tentacles for a mouth, small wings, and is covered in geometrical white lines.<br/><br/><i>["You have Cthulhu Mythos?"<br/><br/>"Nope."<br/><br/>"You're fine then, but please make a Mythos shock Stability test."]</i><br/><br/>"This is what you ship to Paris?"<br/><br/>"I just ship 'em. This goes to...Edouard Gavigan."<br/><br/>"He's no longer among the living."<br/><br/>"Sorry for his widow. Go bring this up with Wycroft, he does all the supplying." He shiftily looks back at his warehouse.<br/><br/>As Francis leaves, the Koori named Billy stops him. "Strange things going on here, boss. Strange cargo in the warehouse."<br/><br/>"Who works here at nights?"<br/><br/>"Nobody, just Billy, boss."<br/><br/>"Make sure nobody is here tonight."<br/><br/>"I understand, boss. Nobody will be here, boss."<br/><br/>Francis walks off whistling, and calculating the amount of dynamite necessary to destroy the warehouse.<br/><br/><br/><i>[Meant to get to the next bit, but I had a browser crash and had to recover this much out of the session data from Chrome...lucky I was able to get it at all!]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431854/#Comment_431854" name="Item_394" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T20:00:55+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  8:00PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIV: A Brand New Me (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Francis heads down to the Noah Cross house, since Jimmy has told him that Cross is in town. Sister Mary meets him at the door and he  gives her a donation.<br/><br/>"Anonymous?"<br/><br/>"No, tell him it's from Francis O'Donnell. Can you point me to his offices?"<br/><br/>The Reverend Jim sees the sister come back with a large pile of cash--American dollars, French francs, Greek drachmas, British and Colonial pounds. <br/><br/>"How generous!"<br/><br/>"Indeed. Were you planning to call on Mr. Cross today?"<br/><br/>"I was at that." Jim sets out for the office.<br/><br/><br/>Francis reaches the office first, however. Cross' secretary, a young man who's obviously served in the military, meets him. "You have an appointment?"<br/><br/>"No, but tell him that a friend of Charleston Chiu's is here. He'll know who it is."<br/><br/>"Have a seat."<br/><br/>They spend several minutes glaring at each other, clearly taking each other's measure.<br/><br/>The door bangs open. "Reverend James Jones to see Mr. Cross!"<br/><br/>Francis looks up, at the man clad all in black, wearing black gloves despite the heat. It's the same preacher from the docks the day before, but this is the first time he's had a chance to see him from the front.<br/><br/>His eyes narrow.<br/><br/>Standing in front of him is Charleston Chiu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Saviour? You look unwell, sir. If you have any troubles weighing you down, please tell me. I'm from the United States--Reverend James Warren Jones. Most people call me Brother."<br/><br/>"Where do you come from?"<br/><br/>"A little town called Shanghai, West Virginia. I can tell from your accent that you're American too! Let's shake. Now, I know, it's a bit irregular, a white man shaking hands with a black man, but I'm hoping that here, on the other side of the world, we can put racial differences aside."<br/><br/>"Agreed."<br/><br/><i>[I was cracking up the whole time--OP's expression was priceless. I pondered calling for a Stability check, but decided that just meeting someone who was head-wound crazy wasn't enough to trigger one. JP also showed up just at this time.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy opens the door. "Francis! They searched our hotel! They arrested Freddie, again!"<br/><br/>"Jimmy, take a breath. Let me introduce you to my Negro friend here, the Reverend Jones."<br/><br/>"James Warren Jones, reverend by trade, but most people call me Brother Jones. Put 'em there, Jimmy."<br/><br/>"I...wish I had been arrested."<br/><br/>"Well, you weren't, praise Jesus."<br/><br/>"Praise Jesus indeed," says Noah Cross, entering. "I see the Reverend has met you."<br/><br/>"I don't think we've had the pleasure," says Francis. "This is my associate, James Wright. I believe we all have a mutual acquaintance--Charleston Chiu."<br/><br/>"Will he be joining us tonight?" asks Brother Jones.<br/><br/>"We can only hope!" says Cross. "I seem to recall meeting him in Zanzibar. Fine fellow, bit misguided. To be frank, I don't think the elevator ran all the way to the top with him. But I'm sure he's fine now--he just needed to find himself."<br/><br/>"He just needed to find Jesus," says Jones.<br/><br/>"I'm sure you're right, Reverend. Why, before you found Jesus, you were probably a completely different man."<br/><br/>Cross takes them into his office. He offers them a drink, which Jimmy laps up quickly. "I was just asking Brother Jones to come out to our excavation in the desert, to preach to our workers."<br/><br/>"An ancient city, perhaps?" says Francis. "I'm sorry, subterfuge bores me sometimes. Ancient bat gods and such?"<br/><br/>"Mr. O'Donnell, you sound like you want to visit yourself."<br/><br/>"I have an archaeologist with me."<br/><br/>"Ah, Dr. Dodge. Well, we must insist on secrecy, but I'd be delighted to have you all. What we've found in the desert will change not just the future of archaeology, but of all mankind."<br/><br/>"Are you shipping things to Paris?"<br/><br/>"To Paris? No. But unscrupulous men on the edges of the dig may be stealing items. My security forces can't be everywhere."<br/><br/>"Can we leave tonight?"<br/><br/>"That would be fine."<br/><br/>"Let's say ten."<br/><br/>"Oh, your friend Count Orlok? I can make the charges go away, if you like. Be happy and delighted to have him with us."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy is tasked with gathering explosives and meeting Francis later. He stops for a cup of tea.<br/><br/>As he finishes the tea, he sees his name spelled out in tea leaves at the bottom.<br/><br/>He trembles.<br/><br/>"Another cup of tea, sir?"<br/><br/>"I'm good."<br/><br/>He wanders out to find a flophouse, since their hotel got burned. "We rent by the hour, sir. Can I get you a sheila?"<br/><br/>"No thanks."<br/><br/>"All right. Oh, here's your complementary cup of tea."<br/><br/>Jimmy stretches out on the bed and takes a nap. When he wakes up, the tea cup has steamed up the window.<br/><br/>Written on the window is YOU ARE IN DANGER.<br/><br/>"Are you a benevolent tea leaf spirit? Do you know what I'm in danger from?"<br/><br/>"Jimmy, you're talking to a window," says Francis, walking into the room.<br/><br/>"It said I was in danger."<br/><br/>"If the window is talking to you, I wouldn't believe it. Trust in you.

Francis arranges to have a room ready so that they can take a shower after burning down the warehouse, so as to wash off the soot and smell of accelerant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431855/#Comment_431855" name="Item_395" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T20:09:02+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  8:09PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2014 8:09PM by Lisa Padol.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "They arrested Freddie, again!"<br/><br/>*grin*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431888/#Comment_431888" name="Item_396" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T10:35:52+00:00" title="April 30, 2014 10:35AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"They arrested Freddie, again!"<br/><br/>*grin*</blockquote>\n:-)<br/><br/>FP wasn't at the session, so I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. There was actually a bit of RP handling that--Francis got back to the hotel and saw the Territorials leading Freddie out--but since it really didn't impact the plot in the next session (or, really, this one) I cut it when doing the writeup. (I do that, sometimes, and I condense dialogue, especially for the NPCs, where lately I've been cutting out any of the back-and-forth between them and the PCs that seems to be just conversational noise.)<br/><br/>I should have recorded OPs reaction with a camera; all I have is me cracking up on the the recording, for an extended period of time. CP and I played this very straight; he pitched the idea to me a few weeks before the session and I practically fell down on the sidewalk because it was so good. And we were both careful about how we dealt with the NPC interactions to not spoil the reveal--go back and read the writeups, I was quite carefully navigating the ambiguities. ;-)<br/><br/>It occurred to me as I wrote this up that this kind of surprise really can only work in, say, literature or RPGs, which was a somewhat interesting observation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431889/#Comment_431889" name="Item_397" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T10:37:26+00:00" title="April 30, 2014 10:37AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and sorry Joe--you deserve props for figuring it out, but I didn't want to let on before the surprise ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431890/#Comment_431890" name="Item_398" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T11:12:34+00:00" title="April 30, 2014 11:12AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2014 11:13AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I still fell for it!  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431907/#Comment_431907" name="Item_399" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T17:59:03+00:00" title="April 30, 2014  5:59PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIV: A Brand New Me (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>That night Francis and Jimmy sneak into the warehouse, evading the shore patrol. As they hop through the window, Francis suddenly realizes they're not alone. "Duck, Jimmy!" he shouts, rolling away from someone swinging a club at him.<br/><br/><i>[OP: Billy!<br/><br/>Me: Yup.<br/><br/>OP: He </i>lied<i> to me?<br/><br/>Me: Yup! Normally the oppressed people are on  your side in my game, but this time they're not!]</i><br/><br/>Four Kooris move in towards them. Francis whips out his boot gun and the sawed-off. Two tremendous booms later, two Kooris drop the the ground,  but the remaining two smack Francis hard with a club.<br/><br/>Jimmy pulls out his pistol. "I do not have <i>time</i> for this," he says, glowering at them.<br/><br/>The two Kooris turn and scamper away.<br/><br/><i>[Intimidation spend by JP.]</i><br/><br/>"Set the charges fast," says Francis. "We need to be out of here in less than a minute."<br/><br/>As Jimmy hurries down an aisle, a crate suddenly tumbles in front of him and splits open. Inside is a strange machine, unlike anything he's ever seen.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, we don't have time!" barks Francis, but Jimmy scoops the array of rods, wheels, mirrors and an eye tube. Given enough time Jimmy thinks he could figure out how to work it. Oddly enough, although the machine itself is clearly alien technology, the <i>parts</i> are all made by humans.<br/><br/><i>[And here we discovered that Jimmy didn't actually have Explosives skill--it was Charleston that had that skill.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy sets the charges. Suddenly he realizes that he has accidentally lit one of the fuses. He barrels out the door, followed by Francis.<br/><br/>The shockwave knocks both of them to the ground. They get up, mostly unharmed. Behind them the remains of the warehouse are burning.<br/><br/>Sparks and cinders blow in the air.<br/><br/>Too late, Francis realizes the danger of lighting a fire in an area surrounded by wooden houses, in a desert.<br/><br/>Soon several buildings are on fire. A woman buttonholes Francis. "Help me, my daughter is trapped in our house!"<br/><br/>Rushing over, Francis sees a little girl standing in a second story window. "Jump!" he barks, and the girl leaps neatly into his arms.<br/><br/>"My kitty--" she says. Francis hands her back to her mother.<br/><br/>"Oh thank you sir," says the woman. "I'll be sure to mention to the police how you helped us!"<br/><br/>Groaning, Francis hurries off into the night.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy, not bogged down by saving anyone's life, gets back to the flophouse first and takes a long, mostly cold shower. He sits down on the cot.<br/><br/>Suddenly he realizes that someone is sitting next to him. "Why can't you bother someone else," he mutters, afraid to turn.<br/><br/>"Hello, James!" says Noor.<br/><br/>"Gah!"<br/><br/>"Didn't you get my messages? Oh, you found the thing. That's good."<br/><br/>"It was a window talking to me!"<br/><br/>"I know, I'm not very good at this yet."<br/><br/>"But you're--"<br/><br/>"Dead? Yes, I know."<br/><br/>"Why me?"<br/><br/>"Because you were always nice to me. And also Charleston seems to have taken a vacation."<br/><br/>"You were with us..."<br/><br/>"Indeed, I got turned inside out by the Dark Lord. It was kind of ironic--the last thing I remember thinking was, yes, I know how to turn a dog inside out! Your sister is very worried about you, I check in on her from time to time. Would you like to see her?"<br/><br/>"I think it would be better if she didn't see you."<br/><br/>"Oh, we would not appear to her. I can only appear to you right now."<br/><br/>"Why are you here?"<br/><br/>"To help you! Do you have Charleston's books?"<br/><br/>"Dr. Mwimbe has them."<br/><br/>"Oh, I guess she has all the books now. And all the artifacts! I suppose if you showed that device to her, she'd take that too. I'm not sure what it does, but I think it has to do with mind control and time travel. Oh, and you are also in terrible danger."<br/><br/><i>[OP: I've just realized something terrible. Mwimbe has been playing us all along. <br/><br/>Me: She's been quite helpful...<br/><br/>CP: I just figured that was the price of her getting what she wants.]</i><br/><br/>"From what?"<br/><br/>"It's hard for me to think of time from a mortal perspective. But...trap doors are dangerous. And be afraid of the dark. Oh, and you may get unexpected help from an unexpected source. Wait. I'm supposed to be more cryptic. Was that cryptic enough?"<br/><br/>"Very cryptic."<br/><br/>"Oh, good. I'm not used to this speaking from the dead business yet."<br/><br/>"I'm not used to talking to the dead."<br/><br/>"We'll get used to it together! Jimmy, I like you. And you can see me! I don't know, everyone else I tried to talk to couldn't see me. It's like you're lucky! I have to go now."<br/><br/>"Stay...uh..."<br/><br/>"Dead? I will."<br/><br/>She vanishes.<br/><br/>Jimmy crawls into the corner of his bunk and begins to play with the device. He thinks that he could figure it out, if he were to think about the eldritch principles a bit...<br/><br/>He decides to do that after he's recovered from seeing a ghost.<br/><br/><i>[It's a one-point Mythos spend to activate the device. JP was wise.<br/><br/>I couldn't resist bringing Noor back, bad form I know--but she was one of my favorite NPCs to play. This way I figured I could harrass a PC into losing some Stability (it's a 7-point Stability test to "talk with someone you know well who is dead.") Plus, as we will see, Jimmy can use Noor's spirit to see his sister, allowing him to refresh his Stability.<br/><br/>Episode XVI is where I'm coming for their Stability, I think.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431908/#Comment_431908" name="Item_400" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T17:59:36+00:00" title="April 30, 2014  5:59PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2014 6:00PM by Aviatrix.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIV: A Brand New Me (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>They gather outside Noah Cross' office. "Mr. O'Donnell, are you all right? You look like you fell down," says Cross.<br/><br/>"There was a problem at the docks. I was helping some lady with her daughter."<br/><br/>"Aren't you the good samaritan. Good to see you Brother Jones. I've always liked the night sky here--you can see my namesake hanging above us. Now, gentlemen, please step into the back of this truck."<br/><br/>Melissa Ford, RN meets the Rev for the first time. "Oh, Mr. Chiu! You found him!"<br/><br/>"This is Reverend Jones," says Francis.<br/><br/>"I've heard of this sort of thing," says Melissa. "Mr. O'Donnell, you do know his condition has taken a serious turn for the worse. Has the Charleston personality returned at all?"<br/><br/>"Not that I know."<br/><br/>"Maybe we should sedate him and take him to a hospital."<br/><br/>"Where? Anyway, there's a fire down by the docks. It's probably burned down."<br/><br/><i>[We joked that not only had Francis probably blown Freddie's cover, but he was doing a heckuva job striking a blow for Imperialism. I wondered what his next career would be--troubleshooter for Standard Oil?]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Wednesday, 21 October 1925</i><br/><br/>They spend two days crossing the desert. O'Donnell and company mostly are allowed out of the truck at night, in the fantastic stillness of the desert.<br/><br/>The night before they reach the dig site, Francis has a terrible dream. Isabelle is being tortured to death, over and over again, each time screaming "Fran\xe7ois! Pourqoui, pourquoi?"<br/><br/>His screams wake everyone up. The camp attendants, who are strangely heavily armed, demand that they quiet Francis before he attracts predators. In desperation, Melissa gives him a paralytic to shut him up.<br/><br/>"I sense the presence of the devil! Here, in this white boy!" intones Brother Jones. "What we need is an exorcism! Mr. Cross, I need a gallon of water to bless, a bibble, and some...blokes to help me."<br/><br/>Cross' goons have no problem pinning Francis. "Hey, he's already paralyzed," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"We can't trust that. He's possessed by the devil, right?"<br/><br/>A Koori approaches Jones. "You are a good Christian man. I will help you, although infection has made me blind."<br/><br/>And indeed, his eyes are completely black.<br/><br/>"Allow me to ask," says the Koori. "You are an American black man?"<br/><br/>"I am. What do they call you?"<br/><br/>"Omar."<br/><br/>"James Warren Jones."<br/><br/>"James? Strange, I thought your name should be Chuck. Is that not short for James? I do not know your American idiom. I've known many American idiots."<br/><br/>"If in return for your assistance, you want to call me Chuck, that's fine."<br/><br/>"Once, before I lost my sight, I saw a clown. Very amusing. His name was Chuckles. Can I call you that? Or is that insulting?"<br/><br/>"Let's see how this exorcism goes. To tell the truth, this is my first exorcism, but nothing can stop the power of Jesus."<br/><br/>"He stinks of evil. Also...cordite. And death. He stinks of death. I think someone died, who was very important to him. That happened to you too, didn't it?"<br/><br/>"I don't...think so..."<br/><br/>"Perhaps you owned a dog? In the past? Did you lose a dog recently?"<br/><br/>James just stares.<br/><br/>"We have many gods here," says Omar. "The rainbow serpent. Do not insult our gods--you eat your god, after all. Some worship the Sand Bat, a being of great marvel and mystery, although some say it is evil."<br/><br/>"Nought shall come of the worship of gods other than Jesus."<br/><br/>"You should only worship gods who are worthy of worship, don't you think?"<br/><br/>"You should only worship the only God who is a god, the one right here in the Bibble."<br/><br/>"I couldn't agree with you more, Mr....James. I hear more people than I thought."<br/><br/>"That's because you're blind."<br/><br/>"There is Mr. O'Donnell. And someone whispering."<br/><br/>"That's Jimmy."<br/><br/>"Ah, another James! Should I call you Chuckles? When I could still see, I used to read the comics, you know...but now people have to read them to me, Jimmy. Ah, Mr. O'Donnell is waking up."<br/><br/>"Time for your salvation, boy," says Jones.<br/><br/>"I will go get some water," says Omar. "Oh, and Jimmy? I will see you in the funny pages."<br/><br/>"Jimmy, you find it odd that Mr. Cross would hire a blind man for manual labor?" says Jones after Omar leaves.<br/><br/>"He creeped me out! Especially that bit about worshipping gods worthy of worship!"<br/><br/>"Jimmy, Jimmy, these people are ignorant heathens! They need to hear the word of God."<br/><br/>"I miss the old Charleston," mutters Jimmy. "Miss Ford, do you have something for Francis?"<br/><br/>"An antagonist? Yes..." says Melissa.<br/><br/>"What about my exorcism?" says Jones. He watches Francis come to--he mutters something, but sadly it seems he's just drugged, not speaking in tongues.<br/><br/>"What, I missed it?" says Cross, coming up.<br/><br/>"Mr. Cross? Do you have a blind worker?"<br/><br/>"Why would I bring a blind worker into the desert?" says Cross.<br/><br/><i>["Hey, everyone who just figured with Jimmy who that was--make a Stability check!"

"Noor...I want to see my sister now..."<br/><br/>"Oh, sure, now you want to see me, just because I'm not the only ghost in the area."<br/><br/>"There's another ghost?"<br/><br/>"Yes, some man who got set on fire. He's a bit sensitive about it, so try not to have any fire around him. So you want to see your sister?"<br/><br/>"I'm freaking out a bit."<br/><br/>"OK! <i>Take my hand</i>..." she intones in a sepulchral voice.<br/><br/>"Could you turn down the creepy?"<br/><br/>"Sorry, I don't have fine control on it yet..."<br/><br/>Jimmy feels like he is being torn in two while being buried alive, and cold, so cold...<br/><br/>He sees his sister, reading the last letter he sent her. "Poor Jimmy, I miss you." She shivers. "Feels like a rabbit just walked over my grave."<br/><br/>"I miss you too..." sighs Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Oh, this is making it worse!" says Noor. "Emotions don't work like that for the living! I bask in this grief and sorrow."<br/><br/>"Me, not so much..."<br/><br/>"But doesn't it make you feel alive? Look on the positive side."<br/><br/>"It almost feels like he's here," sighs Lucy. <br/><br/>Jimmy suddenly realizes that <i>her mouth isn't moving when she talks</i>.<br/><br/>"We have to go now," says Noor. "This is collect."<br/><br/>"By the way, that thing with Francis screaming..."<br/><br/>"Oh, I don't know who did that, but it was magic. Bye!"<br/><br/><i>[Since I'm using modified rules from Night's Black Agents, this was good for a 4-pt Stability refresh.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the morning they arrive at the camp. Francis notices that the terrain matches the photos Dr. Dodge showed him in Sydney. A shed has been built in the area, and the hum of a generator can be heard nearby. The entrance is guarded by some goons, and protected by sandbags.<br/><br/>Behind them, a long staircase leads into the ground. "The construction is new," opines Dodge, "but the blocks...based on the weathering, I'd say...at least 10,000 years. Maybe older. Maybe a <i>lot</i> older. Cross really is onto something."<br/><br/>"That could be pre-human," says Francis.<br/><br/>"What do you mean? Some kind of...Martians?"<br/><br/>"The city was built by...terrestrial creatures, or at least their hands were," says Cross. "There are many secrets to show you below."<br/><br/>The generator powers a string of electric lights that run down the staircase. They descend at least 300 feet below the surface.<br/><br/>"One thing you have to watch," says Cross, "is the bats. We try to get rid of them, but just avoid them if you can."<br/><br/>"Have you found any trapdoors?" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"That's a very specific question."<br/><br/>"I'm a private investigator."<br/><br/>"Ha! Very droll! You a private investigator!" Cross laughs as he descends ahead of them.<br/><br/>At the bottom of the staircase they find a corridor of closely-fitted stones. Jimmy notices that the ceiling has been braced up with shoring and wooden planks; he quickly realizes that this corridor was not built underground, but instead buried through the natural action of sand drifting.<br/><br/>He does a quick calculation on how long that would take:<br/><br/>Five hundred thousand years.<br/><br/><i>[Archaeology use by JP.]</i><br/><br/>At the end of the corridor, a clapboard house has been built in a vaulted area.<br/><br/>"It was easiest to just get a prefab house and put it up here. The corridors around us were built by something far older. Now, what mysteries can I show you, gentlemen? Mr. O'Donnell...Mr. Wright...Mr. Chiu..."<br/><br/>"You forgot Dr. Dodge," says Francis.<br/><br/>"Ah, yes. William, could you take care of Dr. Dodge."<br/><br/>Two goons rush up and seize the hapless archaeologist.<br/><br/>"I'm so sorry, gentlemen, you seem to have blundered right into it."<br/><br/>Francis jerks up his revolver and fires point-blank into Cross's face. The bullet smashes to a stop two inches in front of Cross' face.<br/><br/>"William, educate Mr. O'Donnell," says Cross. One of the goons produces a strange, futuristic-looking firearm. Lightning bursts from the end of the gun, shocking Francis and knocking him to the floor. The lights dim while the gun is fired.<br/><br/>Francis drops his gun.<br/><br/>"Mr. Cross, this is most un-Christian of you," says Jones.<br/><br/>"Mr. Chiu, would you come with me?"<br/><br/>"Of course!" Jones glances at Jimmy. Without a word, each one of them takes off in opposite directions, pursued by Cross' goons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy huffs his way down a long corridor lit by electric lights, goons hot on his tail. He veers down an unlit corridor and crouches in the darkness.<br/><br/>"Where'd he go," says one goon.<br/><br/>"Down there. Did you bring a lightning gun?"<br/><br/>"No. I'm not going down there without one."<br/><br/>"Wait here, I'll fetch one."<br/><br/>The remaining goon nervously peers into the darkness.<br/><br/><br/>"Let me introduce myself," says Cross. "My name is Dr. Robert Huston."<br/><br/>"From the Carlyle expedition," says Francis. He notices that Huston appears much younger than he expected. "I had a dream last night. It was magical..."<br/><br/>"There are spells my colleagues knew in New York. You need a special bowl, which I do not have. Mr. O'Donnell, we both know that I cannot break you--torture will be useless."<br/><br/>"Let's negotiate, then."<br/><br/>"I plan to remake the human race. I am going to reprogram it, to take a great leap forward."<br/><br/>"I just want Jimmy to get back to his sister."<br/><br/>"Clearly you don't know how this game is played. You gave me so many loopholes--I could send him back in a coffin. I'm a therapist, I believe in fair play. Just as I was to Carlyle--Roger came to me a very sick man--but the perfect tool to bring <i>me</i> into the game. Sir Aubrey can sit on his little island making plans; I am going to <i>save</i> the human race."<br/><br/>"I've faced a lot of things, but nothing has touched me so far.

"I'm faced with the inevitability of..."<br/><br/>"What are you saying?"<br/><br/>"<i>Some things cannot be overcome</i>."<br/><br/><i>[CRACK! was the sound of one of Francis' pillars shattering--"Everything can be overcome."]</i><br/><br/>"I think you might be very useful to me as an experiment. Why don't we arrange an introduction to some...powers."<br/><br/>"I think it's time."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crouching in the corridor, Jimmy takes the device he found in the warehouse in Port Hedland out of his rucksack. He stares at it for a long time, tracing the strange geometries of the device. Cautiously he pushes some switches. Things begin to spin and whirr. <br/><br/>He picks up the device and peers through the "scope."<br/><br/>Colors and flashes of light! His head whirls and he feels faint.<br/><br/><i>[Mythos spend to activate--4 Stability, 1 Sanity.]</i><br/><br/>He sees the reflection of his eye in a mirror. Then...something else. An archway. Flash. His eye. The archway. His eye. The archway. The archway. The archway...<br/><br/>He is standing in a room.<br/><br/>In front of him is an archway. Beyond it is a table littered with strange equipment. Some of it he almost recognizes...and somehow he knows that he can't walk through the archway.<br/><br/><i>Walk</i>. Something is wrong with his legs. And the angle...based on the height of the other corridors, he seems...taller.<br/><br/>He raises his hands.<br/><br/>They aren't hands.<br/><br/>They are claws, pincers like lobster claws.

At the bottom of the pit, some things move into the light.<br/><br/>He recoils violently. There is some kind of horrible, twisted, partly-human monstrosities moving below. Horrid quasi-human things.<br/><br/>He runs away, muttering a prayer for their souls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"The checkpoint's not manned," says one of the guards escorting Francis and Noah Cross down a dimly lit hallway.<br/><br/>"What?" says Cross. "Where's--"<br/><br/>From the shadows, a man steps out. Covered in blood. And holding a lightning gun. He walks with the contact at the end of the barrel dragging on the ground, spitting sparks with each step.<br/><br/>Francis raises his eyebrows in surprise. It's Jimmy.<br/><br/>"For a long time I have relished the possibility of this moment, Dr. Huston," says Jimmy in a monotone voice. He glances around. "Anyone who does not wish to die should probably lie down now."<br/><br/>"Who the hell are--" Huston's eyes widen. He turns and bolts up the hallway.<br/><br/>Jimmy shoots a bolt of lightning after him, but Huston is already out of range. He stares at the gun in his hands. "They always lacked enough range. Even when we invented them." He begins to electrocute the guards lying on the ground.<br/><br/>He stops above Francis. "You are a prisoner," he says flatly. "Human. Not very intelligent. The keys to your restraints are probably on one of the guards." He pauses. "I think you know me, or at least this body."<br/><br/>Francis fishes out a set of keys, and picks up the one lighting gun the guards had with them. <br/><br/>"We should move on," says Jimmy. "The noise might have attracted the dwellers below."<br/><br/>He looks at the gun Francis is holding. "This one--" he says, holding up his gun, "Is ancient. Made by us. That one is...new."<br/><br/>"Will it work?"<br/><br/>"My weapon has survived for half a million revolutions of this planet. It works fine. I suspect yours will work nearly as well."<br/><br/>"Very good."<br/><br/>"Let me see that."<br/><br/>Francis hands over the gun with a moment's hesitation. <br/><br/>"Human-made," says Jimmy. "But...not a copy of our design. An adaptation. The renegade made these."<br/><br/>"I do know you...your body."<br/><br/>"Your friend activated one of our devices. Fortunately, my companions in the past were on the alert for such an occurrence. They were able to shunt the transfer to this time. Your friend is quite safe. Imprisoned, but safe."<br/><br/>"Do you wish to return to your body?"<br/><br/>"This body would have certain conveniences to my mission."<br/><br/>"What is your mission? Perhaps I could help."<br/><br/>"I was sent to find the renegade. Unfortunately, Dr. Huston trapped me."<br/><br/>"Well, we go find Huston, kill him, and then kill this renegade."<br/><br/>"The renegade may prove more difficult to find. He has our abilities, after all. He will look like one of you. However...are there any scientists of this era who have a particularly sharp knowledge of technology?"<br/><br/>"Many. Someone built this gun, after all."<br/><br/><i>[JP: Is Tesla still alive at this time?<br/><br/>Me: As a matter of fact, he is very much alive.]</i><br/><br/>"I think I have a name, but he lives in...Slovakia, I think."<br/><br/>"Interesting. I am not familiar with your nation-states. You are fortunate I even speak your language...but I have been here a long time. We should go. Keep your gun, in case the dwellers from below come. With hope the trapdoors will hold."<br/><br/>"I don't want to kill anything that is trapped," says Francis.<br/><br/>"Human life is of low concern to me but I will try to honor that request.<br/><br/><br/><br/>James Jones comes to a gaping hole in the corridor. On the other side, there's a kind of platform.<br/><br/>A platform the size of the hole, as a matter of fact.<br/><br/>Like, a giant trap door.<br/><br/>He sticks his head over the side. Absolute blackness. A stale, foul breeze blows up.<br/><br/>He drops a rock below. He listens for a long time, but he never hears it hit bottom. However, the wind begins to whistle.<br/><br/>Almost...like a tune.<br/><br/>He grabs his crucifix, takes a running start, and vaults over the pit.<br/><br/>He tries to lift the trapdoor, but it's far too heavy.<br/><br/><i>[Requires a 15-point spend to close.

Towards him.<br/><br/>He picks up speed.<br/><br/><i>[Fleeing check by CP. <br/><br/>OP: You know, Charleston's Rincewind...]</i><br/><br/>After a while, Jones comes to a huge domed room. In the center is a gigantic purple stone, some five hundred feet in diameter. As he watches it, it pulsates in a disturbing fashion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy continues to howl. A guard finally arrives. "Shut up Kaktakatak." He throws a switch. "Well, what is it you want?"<br/><br/>"You can understand me?"<br/><br/>"I threw the switch, didn't I? Come on, we need that code for Project Babbage tonight. We have deadlines!"<br/><br/>"I have deadlines too. Caused by your deadlines. Now...what was Babbage again?"<br/><br/>The guard throws the switch in disgust and stalks out.<br/><br/>After a while, Huston walks in and throws the switch. "Mr...Wright, I presume?"<br/><br/>"No..."<br/><br/>"Don't lie to me, James, it will go badly for you."<br/><br/>"I was hoping to travel in time."<br/><br/>"Well, you traveled in space instead. Congratulations. You accomplished the same thing you could have by walking. Now, we're going to set a little surprise for your friends. But first, I'm afraid I'm going to have to hurt you, James. I've always wondered if this would work...I'm going to see if I can shock you enough that your other body will hurt."<br/><br/>Huston pushes a button.<br/><br/>The floor to Jimmy's cell turns out to be electrified.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis sees "Jimmy" stumble.<br/><br/>"I know where Huston is. He's with your friend."<br/><br/>"You mean your body."<br/><br/>"Let's not split hairs. It wasn't my body originally. I am a member of the Yithian race. We travel in space and time. We came to your world long ago, and found bodies to inhabit. It is how I can do what I am doing now. Let's go pay a visit to the doctor."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jones grips his "bibble" and crucifix and steps into the room. "Is there anything in this room other than me?"<br/><br/>There's no reply. He makes some random whistling noises and approaches the dome. Now that he's further in the room, he can see that some sand has leaked into the chamber over time.<br/><br/>In the sand is a human skull and femur. They both have been chewed on.<br/><br/>A three-foot high block is nearby. He can see dark stains on the block, and scorch marks--as if someone has been sacrificing people, and tossing them on a fire.<br/><br/>Behind the block, a 25-foot high statue looms, of a hideous, black, twisted bat thing. With tentacles.<br/><br/>There are other statues behind it; glistening spheres...with tentacles. A giant flame that is consuming, seeming to move. A creature of horns...hooves...tentacles. His mind reels.<br/><br/>Then he sees something behind the statues move...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432141/#Comment_432141" name="Item_407" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-05T22:35:55+00:00" title="May  5, 2014 10:35PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Were you playing K-in-Jimmy's-body, then?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432170/#Comment_432170" name="Item_408" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-06T08:16:05+00:00" title="May  6, 2014  8:16AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Were you playing K-in-Jimmy's-body, then?</blockquote>\nYup.

The possessed body slumps forward, unconscious.<br/><br/>"I assume this shows my intent," says Francis, stepping forward.<br/><br/>"I feel like I still should kill you," muses Huston. "I have your friend, and you've taken care of my enemy. I'm not playing with you like M'Weru does. I think we should have killed you in Paris. But...perhaps you should talk to my Lord."<br/><br/>Two guards pick up Jimmy's body. Francis falls in next to Jimmy/Katakatak.<br/><br/>"Why did you shoot my body?" says Jimmy, turning on the translation box.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Reverend James Jones squints in the darkness. Behind the statues are hideous bat-like things. They seem dormant.<br/><br/>At that moment, Huston and his party enter. "Ah, Doctor Jones. Or should I say, Charleston Chiu."<br/><br/>The Rev flings one of the human femurs behind the statues. The bat things shriek and awake, spreading misshapen, spiked wings.<br/><br/>Francis falls to his knees.<br/><br/><i>[So: Francis had a pillar shattered, then failed a Mythos Stability test when he saw Jimmy/Katakatak. This brought him below 0, so he lost another point of Sanity.

"Ah, my pets, my pretties," says Huston.<br/><br/>Jimmy/Katakatak glides forward and slaps Katakatak/Jimmy in the face. He turns off the translation box and yells, "Wake up! We need your help!"<br/><br/>"Your...diction...is terrible..." mutters the reviving K/J. "It's like...listening to someone punch a box of broken glass. "<br/><br/>"Bats! How do we make them friends?"<br/><br/>"The statues are a magic reservoir...you could try that. Or you could make a deal with Huston before he tells them to kill everyone, which he's going to do in a moment. Or you could kill Huston. These are all viable options. I would have tried a few earlier, but your friend ELECTROCUTED me!"<br/><br/>"He does things like that. Dumb things, sometimes. A lot of the times."<br/><br/>"If you can get me close to one of the statues, I can probably do something."<br/><br/>Hooting and burbling, J/K grabs K/J by the ankle and starts dragging him towards the statues. "Hey! He's getting away!" shout the guards, and they lay down a withering cross-fire with their lightning guns. J/K rolls through the zone, shrugging off the shocks.<br/><br/><i>[I called for an Athletics test here; JP got a 10.]</i><br/><br/>He props K/J up against a stature. "I never thought I'd cast <i>this</i> spell," mutters the alien. He begins to chant softly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"My Lord," says Huston, "It's time for you to come out, and meet Francis and Charleston in your more natural form."<br/><br/>One of the statues begins to move.<br/><br/>Jimmy/Katakatak notices this. He also realizes, with his knowledge of the Mythos, that Francis' mind will never survive seeing a non-human form of Nyarlathotep. He slaps Francis in the head with one of his claws, hooting loudly. Francis keels over, mercifully unconscious.<br/><br/>"It's like...you're writing on a chalkboard with a cheese grater," moans Katakatak/Jimmy.<br/><br/>"When this is all over we can have a cup of tea and talk diction."<br/><br/>"Why would I want to drink...hot leaf juice? And why did you hit the male-human-with-small-thought-processes?"<br/><br/>"To save him."<br/><br/>"You should probably do something about your bifurcated-personality friend over there."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Rev serpentines his way around the vast expanse of the dome. Bolts of lightning rain down around him. He stops short. Raises his "Bibble," and his crucifix.<br/><br/>"Monsters! Demons! You hold no power over me! I think! Back, back...stop flying around...what's happening."<br/><br/>Omar is suddenly standing next to him. "Yes, that's what I want to know."<br/><br/>"You wouldn't know, you're bli--wait a minute. How did you get here?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I was always here. This is kind of my place. I like it here."<br/><br/>The Rev grabs him and shakes him. "You fool! Don't you know what's going on here?"<br/><br/>"Oh, that is really rich, especially coming from you! You know, I think I like you better this way." He laughs maliciously. "Oh, Charleston, Charleston, what are we going to do with you?"<br/><br/>"Listen, you crazy old coot! I've seen statues moving, I've seen bats the size of two men!"<br/><br/>"Hrm," muses "Omar", "I've never been in the same place twice at the same time....well, in this room at least."<br/><br/>"This is pointless. Just leave your hand on my shoulder so you don't get lost. The power of Jesus will stop them!"<br/><br/>"Those bat-things are made in my image, would you like to see them closer?"<br/><br/><br/><i>[I realized JP should probably use the stats for a Great Race member if he was going to attack.

The guards blast at him with their lightning guns. Much to his pleasure, Jimmy/Katakatak discovers that his hide is surprisingly well-armored.<br/><br/>He swipes a claw at one of the guards. <br/><br/>It neatly snips his head off.<br/><br/>Jimmy hoots and screams. The other guards drop their guns and run.<br/><br/>"Now, Jimmy, don't make me have to kill you," says Huston.<br/><br/>J/K swings at him. The claw shoots sparks as it crashes into an invisible wall in front of Huston. The psychiatrist snarls and fires an evil beam of black light at Jimmy/Katakatak. Jimmy's alien body writhes in pain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Rev looks up. Suddenly, a hole blossoms in one of the bat-things. As it crashes to the ground, he gets a glimpse of something...horrid, fluid and bulbous, some kind of...polyp-like thing. Flying around. And mostly invisible.<br/><br/>The air fills with the sound of a familiar whistling.<br/><br/><i>[So, Katakatak/Jimmy cast Summon Flying Polyp, as that was the nearest ass-kicking alien in the area.]</i><br/><br/>"That was my baby!" shouts Omar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Behind Huston, Francis lurches up and fires a lightning gun at Huston. Plasma arcs around him, defining his shield.<br/><br/>"Good by, Mr. O'Donnell," says Huston. He raises his hands...<br/><br/>Jimmy/Katakatak leaps in front of Huston. The beam drains him of vitality and he reels around.<br/><br/>Francis fishes in his pocket. He takes out a bag of cordite. And a blasting cap.<br/><br/>"Now wait just a moment..." says Huston.<br/><br/>Francis hurls it at him. There is a bang and a flash, and his shield collapses.<br/><br/>"You son of a--"<br/><br/>Jimmy/Katakatak swipes him with a claw. <br/><br/>Bleeding from a head wound, Huston staggers back. He shoots a look at Omar. "Lord? LORD!?"<br/><br/>"You humans, I have to do everything myself," sighs the not-Koori.<br/><br/>"You don't have to help him," says Jimmy/Katakatak.<br/><br/>"Kinda I do. Oh and Jimmy? I'm gonna hit you so hard you're going to end up back in that body of yours."<br/><br/>He claps his hands, and the Yithian body is thrown violently twenty feet across the room, crashing into a wall.<br/><br/><i>[J/K was down to -9 Health at this point, after taking two Shriveling spells.]</i><br/><br/>"Come on, Bobby," says Omar, grabbing Huston around the neck. "We're going to Sirius, the long way around."<br/><br/>"But L--"<br/><br/>They both vanish.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The other bat thing explodes. More whistling fills the dome. The huge, hideous statue continues to lurch into life. Francis rounds up the rest of the group.<br/><br/>"There's an exit...nearby...that the polyps use to reach the surface," says Katakatak/Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Polyps?"<br/><br/>"Our ancient flying enemy on this world. They are...mostly invisible. The only thing they're afraid of is electricity."<br/><br/>"You sound bad," says Jimmy/Katakatak.<br/><br/>"I'M A LITTLE BEAT UP. Also, I just watched my body get beat up. Which reminds me...grab one of the guards on our way out. One who's not too hurt."<br/><br/>Jimmy seizes a screaming, crying guard.<br/><br/>They follow a tunnel that slopes upward into the open desert.<br/><br/>"Let's just sort this out," says Katakatak/Jimmy.<br/><br/>He takes out the device.

"Katakatak. Nice to meet you."<br/><br/>"Francis."<br/><br/>"Yeah, I know your name, you're the son-of-a-bitch who shot me." He clutches his head. "This mind is so cluttered! Why would you want to do that to a naked female? And what is the purpose of the peanut butter and jelly?"<br/><br/>"Humans have many base vices..." says the Rev.<br/><br/>"You are a very strange man. I see...as if there are two of you standing there."<br/><br/>"Getting back to the peanut butter...there are many base vices..."<br/><br/>Katakatak snaps his fingers. The Rev freezes. "Charleston Chiu, you are in great danger on your current path. The Dark Lord has not forgotten you, disguise yourself as you will." He snaps his fingers again.<br/><br/>"...which can be overcome with the power of Jesus!" finishes the Rev.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Is this this the 20th or 21st Century?" asks Katakatak, as they circle around to the main entrance to go after Dr. Dodge and Ewa.<br/><br/>"Twentieth," says Francis.<br/><br/>"Oh, yuck," says Katakatak. "As I was saying, we came to this planet about a half a million years ago. Things were really different back then. Have you met the Elder Race? They're still around here somewhere, under the ice. Great guys. Didn't care for us much, but we were mostly extinct by then. Now, it was the Xothians that you really had to watch out for...now, how much do you care about human life?"<br/><br/>"Nothing is more important," says the Rev.<br/><br/>"A great deal," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"We're getting our people," says Francis.<br/><br/>"Hrm. So much for collapsing the tunnels...I have an idea. I'll have to handcuff the three of you..."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"I'm taking these three to detention," says Katakatak to the guard at Huston's clapboard house.<br/><br/>"Thank our Lord you got them! Have you seen the Doc? The programmers are all freaking out! It's crazy down here!"<br/><br/>As the guard turns away, Katakatak shoots him. They go upstairs and rescue Ewa, Dodge, and the other prisoners. Jimmy searches Huston's office.<br/><br/>He finds a large book called "Manual of Programming: Project Lovelace." He also finds a handwritten journal Huston had been keeping. Rifling through it, he finds a timeline, showing how they arrived a few years ago, built a "mainframe", and began working on a project.<br/><br/>At the end, he sees a date.<br/><br/>"14 January 1926: The Gate Opens."<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Sunday, 25 October 1926</i><br/><br/>After an uneventful truck drive across the desert, they return to Port Hedland. Jimmy heads to the docks to see about getting transport to Shanghai. He runs into Captain Hardekker, late of the <i>River of Stars</i>.<br/><br/>It seems that the acting first mate, Desmond Motombo, had found some gold on the derelict freighter. With the proceeds of this, Hardekker and he have bought a trim little diesel-powered yacht. Out of guilt--either conscience, or fear that Jimmy would testify in front of an Admiralty board--he offers to charter them to Shanghai.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Shanghai? No, you're going to Paris," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"You're done," says Francis.<br/><br/>"We're done," says the Rev. "It's over."<br/><br/>"I tell you this. I go home to my sister? I have two months? I'm going to be fretting and worrying about what's going to happen."<br/><br/>"Jimmy. I was going to make a deal to save you. <i>I was going to make a deal.</i> I was going to give up everything to save you."<br/><br/><i>[Me: You guys should totally take a Bond!]</i><br/><br/>"Francis. I'm sorry I hit you."<br/><br/>"Anyway, we can't trust Charleston."<br/><br/>"I don't know who this Charleston is," says the Rev, "but he is bad, bad news."<br/><br/>"We can't face up to N," continues Francis relentlessly. "He'll show up to stop us. Like he did today."<br/><br/><i>[OP was doing a hell of a job playing his shattered pillar.]</i><br/><br/>"All lives are temporary," says the Rev. "It's about what we do."<br/><br/>"And if we lose our souls?" says Francis. "And lose our souls trying to save a life?"<br/><br/>Outside, Melissa Ford begins to sing. She has a wonderful voice.<br/><br/>She is singing the song that was the last song Francis's wife recorded before dying.<br/><br/>"I'll...I'll save the world for you, Jimmy," says Francis.<br/><br/>Guy bursts in just at that moment. "Hey, I found some pretty good wine!" He looks around. "What, did somebody <i>die</i> or something?"<br/><br/><i>[And that was the end of Australia.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432408/#Comment_432408" name="Item_411" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-11T13:03:04+00:00" title="May 11, 2014  1:03PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

Gangsters, foreigners, illicit trade with a backdrop of neon-lit nightclubs. Divided into multiple foreign sections, Shanghai has little municipal government outside the International District (the joint British-American sector) and the French Concession.<br/><br/>Shanghai! Where Jackson Elias seems to have first encountered Jack Brady, and where a shadowy importer named Ho Fong seems to be at the center of a world-wide exchange of artifacts of great evil...<br/><br/><i>Sunday, 8 November 1925</i><br/><br/>The diesel yacht <i>Sterkte</i> makes its way up the Whangpoo river and docks at the Shanghai waterfront. Captain Hardekker and his mate, Desmond Motombo, had to double up in the same cabin to accommodate Freddie, Francis and company. Jimmy notices that they seemed to have done so even before they took them on as passengers.<br/><br/>The customs lines are interminable; the normal bribes merely get them on the less-slowly moving line. Francis notes that security seems tighter than they would have expected. Freddie notes that it is suspiciously easy for him to bribe the customs officials to ignore Francis' arsenal.<br/><br/>As they finally make their way away from the entrepot, two officials in suits approach. Francis and Jimmy immediately suss them as cops.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright? Mr. O'Donnell? Let me introduce myself. I'm Harvey Phillips. I don't know if you know much about the political situation here...well, we had a situation where the Municipal Police fired into a crowd. So there's a curfew, first of all. Oh, this is Clive Basserman, my counterpart on the British side."<br/><br/><i>[The "trouble" was the May 30th Movement, a massive series of strikes and anti-imperialism demonstrations that crippled the city in 1925. A curfew was indeed instituted, and all European/American men were armed as an impromptu militia. The strikes are winding down by this point, after the electricity was cut off to large parts of the city.]</i><br/><br/>"Go on," says Francis.<br/><br/>"Well, we seem to have a little mystery on our hands, and if you could help us out, we'd be delighted to have you dine with the Ambassador tonight."<br/><br/>"This is my associate, Jimmy."<br/><br/>"<i>The</i> James Wright? I remember your ads from when I was in New York. What brings you fellows to Shanghai?"<br/><br/>"I hired them," says "Count Orlok".<br/><br/>"I hope you don't mind us borrowing them? Good. If you boys would come down to the department, we'll talk it over with you."<br/><br/>Freddie sets out to find an inconspicuous place to lay low. He heads out into the Chinese part of the city, and rents a pension in a poor district. Then he begins to put out feelers on Ho Fong, and "The Stumbling Tiger" nightclub--Jax had a matchbook from there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Well, chaps," says Basserman when they've reached the Municipal Police headquarters, "I'm asking for your help not only because of the unusual nature of the case, but because frankly we're stretched very thin. And to be utterly frank, detective work isn't one of the recruiting needs of the SMP."<br/><br/>Francis nods. He's already noted that most of the Shanghai Municipal Police are Indians.<br/><br/>Francis and Jimmy are led down into the morgue, where they're shown a body that's been kept on ice. With his medical training, Francis immediately sees that the body has been completely exsanguinated.<br/><br/>"The only injury was this sucking sore near the aorta," says Basserman. "As if something drained out all the blood through it."<br/><br/>Francis arranges for the body to be transferred to the nearest hospital. Basserman gives him his card--"if you have any trouble, even with the frogs, this will clear you."<br/><br/>Once at the hospital, Francis defrosts the body and pumps it full of saline. Once rehydrated, he discovers several defensive wounds on the man's arms. He can also identify the corpse as almost certainly an Indian. The sucking wound resembles nothing he has ever seen...the closest analog he can find is a lamprey bite. But this is much bigger.<br/><br/>The body was found on the border of the French Concession; he seems to have been a vagrant who was staying at the Pension Montigny, a dive in the Concession. He had no papers on him, and the French seem to consider this not their issue since the body was found--absolutely, definitively--on the Chinese section.<br/><br/>Jimmy heads over to the Pension Montigny. There are checkpoints when he leaves the International District.<br/><br/>The Pension is a run-down residential hotel. After five minutes of hard knocking, a rather used-up woman opens the door. Jimmy can hear the sound of empty bottles being cleared away by the sweep of the door.<br/><br/>"<i>Bon jour</i>?"<br/><br/>"Bon jour."<br/><br/>"<i>Am\xe9ricain</i>. What do you want?" <br/><br/>"I'm looking into a resident of yours, found dead in the Chinese zone?"<br/><br/>"I don't know anything about that." She moves to close the door.<br/><br/>Jimmy jams his foot in the way. "I'm not with the police. I'm a private eye."<br/><br/>"Oh, like in a <i>roman noir</i>! Okay, how can I help, Mister Private Dick?"<br/><br/>"Can you tell me about him?"<br/><br/>"This place is cash only, I don't keep track. It's very hot and I need a drink."<br/><br/>"I have excellent taste in drinks," says Jimmy, producing a flask.  <br/><br/><i>[Flattery and Preparedness by Jimmy.]</i><br/><br/>"That's completely different! My name is Jennie. Room four, room five, the guys left, didn't want the deposit back, so I spent it. Room five, he stay here a long time, always coming and going--stay away for weeks, but he pay the rent. Room four, he was new, just spent all his time in the room. Room five guy came back one night, I hear them talking, and I don't remember what happens next--I had a little snoot--then they both gone."<br/><br/>"Were they French?"<br/><br/>"Room four was Indian. Room Five, spoke Chinese really well, I think he was American."<br/><br/>Jimmy leaves his flask and goes upstairs to check out the rooms. Room five has a homely vibe, as if it has been inhabited for a long time--yet at the same time, there's a certain impersonality, as if the guy was used to leaving in a hurry. Jimmy searches up and down for a long time. He finds next to nothing useful--the few remaing clothes are all secondhand and bought locally--but finally behind the bed he finds a charred piece of paper that he thinks he could extract something from given time and chemicals.<br/><br/>Room four has a similar air--that of an inhabitant used to leaving in a hurry. Under the bed, he finds a valise. Inside is a rather wicked looking kukri. It is very well cared for, and very often used. He also finds several passports with different names. <br/><br/><i>This guy was a pro</i>, thinks Jimmy. <i>And he died, fast and horribly</i>. He has little question that the man in room four was an assassin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie changes clothes, grabs an old book, and soon hits the streets as Fritz Janssen, ex-Spartacist. He decides to look up someone he met briefly in Paris. "Scotty," he thinks. "What did his friends call him? Zhou?"<br/><br/><i>[As it turns out, I was going to bring Zhou En-Lai into this anyway.]</i><br/><br/>Zhou, as it turns out, was looking for him anyway. "Comrade Blakely! How terrible that you must play the aristocrat. We have use for a man of your talents--someone so skilled at defeating the British, in Africa, Australia, Egypt...The Movement progresses. We tweak the foreign imperialists here, while gathering in the south."<br/><br/>"Aren't you some kind of military leader?"<br/><br/>"I have a police training. These men behind me with rifles are here to express their devotion to the cause of our recently departed leader, Sun Zhongsan. Hopefully his idiot son-in-law won't come to power. Do you know Zedong? My friend Comrade Mao?"<br/><br/>"Haven't had the pleasure yet."<br/><br/>"He will do great things. Come and bring your revolutionary insight one day. I think you are kindred spirits."<br/><br/>"I am looking for a man named Jack Brady. He seems to have some connection with the Stumbling Tiger nightclub."<br/><br/>"Interesting. As regards the nightclub, it is a den of enormous decadence and materialism...also...I had not thought it was your kind of place, but no matter. We all struggle together, and I accpet the peccadillos of my fellow comrades. It is run by a phenomenally corrupt Japanese named Isoge Taro. We have a few comrades in the kitchen. Brady, I am afraid I know little about."<br/><br/>"And a businessman named Ho Fong?"<br/><br/>"Very successful gentleman. Not particularly noteworthy until five years ago. Independent, has an international shipping business. He has a warehouse in the Bund district. We DON'T have any comrades in his operation. He is well-protected--not just by the Europeans and the Green Gang, but by a certain...malign influence. We have learned through experience not to tangle with Ho Fong."<br/><br/>"I'll make sure not to let him know you sent me."<br/><br/>"That would be most beneficial to both of us. It would be a shame for our friendship to end on such terms."<br/><br/><i>[Me: Zhou En-Lai was particularly good at the veiled threat.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432412/#Comment_432412" name="Item_414" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-11T14:08:00+00:00" title="May 11, 2014  2:08PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2014 4:26PM by Aviatrix.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>[Inadvertent double-post.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432415/#Comment_432415" name="Item_415" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-11T16:21:08+00:00" title="May 11, 2014  4:21PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: If You See Her, Say Hello (Part 2)</b><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy and Francis meet at their crime scene lab in the hospital. Francis turns over the kukri and the passports to the police.<br/><br/><i>[I offered a spend to make it go faster, but OP said it was "their case--I'm just helping out."]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy is very disturbed by the wound--it reminds him of things he had read in Charleston's books. He prepares a chemical bath to see if he can lift anything off the piece of paper he found.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie hies himself down to the Bund. The warehouse is surrounded by a high concrete wall, with broken bottles embedded along the top. He notices that there seem to be rather fewer people there than most warehouses he's seen (at least before Francis blew them up.) Also, items seem only to be taken out of the warehouse.<br/><br/>He follows a truck from the warehouse down the wharf. The items are being loaded onto a cargo ship. The Port Warden, an American named Commander Jack Bradford. "One of those Russian aristocrats, eh? How can I help you?"<br/><br/>"I'm interested in running some ships here."<br/><br/>"That's us, it all falls under the American River Patrol. Let me explain the details..."<br/><br/>Freddie half-listens, while reading the Commander's log book upside-down. The cargo ship is the <i>Star</i>, bound for Calcutta. There don't seem to be many entries bringing cargo <i>to</i> the warehouse, he notices.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"What ho, gentlemen!" says Freddie. He looks around at the lab that Jimmy and Francis have hijacked. Alembics bubble, bunsen burners flame quietly, and three assistants....shanghaied...by Francis bustle about.<br/><br/>Freddie explains what he has discovered.<br/><br/>"Another warehouse," grunts Francis. A malicious gleam comes into his eye.<br/><br/>Gilbert silently hands out evening clothes to Francis and Jimmy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dinner at the American Embassy is a lavish affair. The cuisine is mostly in the high French style, with a few Chinese touches thrown in for local color.<br/><br/>The servants are all Chinese.<br/><br/>Francis and Jimmy are sitting near an aviator--Commander Earl Spencer, USN.<br/><br/>"What line of work you fellas in?"<br/><br/>"Private investigation," says Francis.<br/><br/>"Really? That's an interesting career."<br/><br/>"Not as interesting as flying," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>Freddie is seated next to his wife, a woman named Wallis.<br/><br/><i>[In answer to your question--how many women named Wallis are there in the world? This is indeed the future wife of Edward, Duke of Windsor.]</i><br/><br/>"Very pleased to meet <i>you</i>," says Wallis. "I feel like I've known you before. You ever come down to Baltimore?"<br/><br/>"Mostly New York, when I was in the States."<br/><br/>"Oh, I love New York. Wish Earl could get posted back there. His career is a bit stalled...maybe Prohibition would cure him of being a drunk."<br/><br/>Freddie notices that Wallis Spencer seems to have a rather unnerving charisma.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unfortunately, Earl Spencer notices Wallis paying attention to Freddie. "Who the hell is she talking to? The [gender slur]."<br/><br/>"That's not a very nice way to talk about your wife," says Francis.<br/><br/>"She's not a very nice lady. What's it to you, anyway? You want to make something of it?"<br/><br/>"I really do."<br/><br/>They walk outside, Earl leading the way. The moment they cross the threshold, Francis kicks Spencer's leg out and begins punching him on the ground.<br/><br/>"He's going to kill Earl! You know how hard it is to get remarried if you're a widow!" says Wallis.<br/><br/>"Won't you get a widow's pension?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Well, he's only a Commander..."<br/><br/>Freddie pulls Francis off of Spencer. Earl and Wallis scream insults at each other.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The party finally crashes to an end around ten PM. "Thank you for a most...interesting evening," says the Ambassador. Freddie and company pile into the car Blakely had hired and head over to the Stumbling Tiger.<br/><br/>Thanks to the curfew, Shanghai is like a ghost town. Finally they arrive at a club with a huge neon sign of a tiger pouncing, then tumbling head over heels. A large crowd of mostly men is gathered outside it.<br/><br/>A lot of the young men are remarkably good-looking.<br/><br/>The lightbulb goes on over Freddie's head.<br/><br/>"Are you a <i>real</i> Russian count?" one of the handsome men asks Freddie as they whisk through the doors.<br/><br/>"Only where it <i>counts</i>," he leers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Once inside, the drag act on the stage, men and women dancing only with other men and women, and waiters wearing very little more than a bow tie quickly allow the rest of the group to come to the same conclusion as Freddie: the Stumbling Tiger is Shanghai's largest gay bar. Freddie is thoroughly amused.<br/><br/>Mr. Isoge is sitting at a roped-off table.<br/><br/><i>[Me: You know there's only one guy who could play this guy--George Takei.<br/><br/>FP: His name definitely sounds like an alias; it's not a real name in Japanese. It means "Faster, Taro, Faster." There's some serious innuendo there.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy recognizes one of the men sitting with Isoge from a picture in the police station--he's Big Ears Tang, the head of the Green Gang, the criminal cartel that runs most of the Chinese section of the city.<br/><br/>Freddie finds one of the comrades who works as a waiter. "Are you here to destroy the British like you did in Cairo?"<br/><br/>"I would never admit to such a thing...but if it were to happen...<br/><br/>"That is wise."<br/><br/>"Can you tell me how to approach Mr. Isoge?"<br/><br/>"Mr. Isoge likes two things--being told how great Mr. Isoge is, and money."<br/><br/>"Fortunately, I have a surfeit of both."<br/><br/><br/><br/>By midnight, Freddie has spent an obscene amount of money. Occasionally they see a person from the Embassy staff or the SMP, and everyone pretends not to recognize each other.<br/><br/>Francis stands in the corner, staring down Green Gang members.<br/><br/>Jimmy hunkers down at the bar. "Excuse me?"<br/><br/>The bartender is Chinese, but has an impeccable Received Pronunciation accent. "How can I help you? I have ales, brandies, single-malts, sake..."<br/><br/>"I've never tried sake," says Jimmy. The bartender fetches it to him in a wooden box. Jimmy looks somewhat askance at the warm liquid.<br/><br/>"Have you worked here long?" he asks the bartender.<br/><br/>"Many years, sir."<br/><br/>"So you would remember say an American woman waltzing in?"<br/><br/>"Sometimes the wives of the Embassy staff come in, looking for a memorable adventure. Taking in the sights, as it were."<br/><br/>"You wouldn't happen to have talked to a woman named Jackson Elias?"<br/><br/>"Me not speak English. Me go now. Bye."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Sir?" Mr. Isoge would consider it an honor to meet with you." Freddie heads over to Isoge's private office.<br/><br/>"So, Count Orlok, what brings you here?"<br/><br/>"I'm enjoying the view. A friend gave me one of these."<br/><br/>"Ah, our matchbook. Is the clientele to your taste? I could arrange something for you."<br/><br/>They banter for a while. Freddie digs for information about the club. "I know many people in Shanghai," purrs Isoge. "If you are looking for someone in particular..."<br/><br/>"Well, a woman named Elias..."<br/><br/>"Ah yes, I heard the name, and hoped she might work out here. But then it turned out she really was a woman. She was here about a year ago. A most impertinent woman."<br/><br/>"But she did tell me about this place, and it has more than lived up to expectations."<br/><br/>"Oh, <i>my</i>."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery use by FP.]</i><br/><br/>Isoge, however, doesn't know anything about Jax's activities in Shanghai; he said she asked about Brady, and he had nothing he could tell her, so she went on her way.<br/><br/>"About Brady..."<br/><br/>"Oh, I don't actually know anything about him..."<br/><br/>Freddie sees that he is obviously lying.<br/><br/>"I only bring him up because a fling of mine said he was...very stimulating."<br/><br/>"I've heard he's hung up on some fellow he met in America. He's a very dangerous fellow to ask after. And a friend of mine."<br/><br/>Isoge considers Freddie carefully. Then he opens a wall safe. "Brady said if anything every happened to him, all his money was to go to these people."<br/><br/>Freddie examines the papers. They are for a worldwide British charity, but the particular chapter is in Singapore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy is still sitting at the bar. A very pretty queen is sitting at the end. "Were you asking about Jackson Elias?"<br/><br/>"Yes?"<br/><br/>"Are you looking for <i>Jack Brady</i>?"<br/><br/>"Maybe..."<br/><br/>There's a pause.<br/><br/>"You could buy a girl a drink."<br/><br/>"Of course."<br/><br/>A few rounds later, she has become very vocal. "Brady used to come in here from time to time, to sing. He has a really good voice. We would dress him up, so people couldn't recognize him. It wasn't his thing, but it was fun. One time, he really tied one on. He had just got back from Singapore, and he was really depressed, and he started to talk about this girl. He almost called her his daughter, but then he caught himself. 'No, she's not that,' he said. 'She's a miracle though.' Then he sobered up and hit me and threatened to kill us if we told anything about it. But I think you have a good heart. Hey, I have to get on! It was <i>really</i> nice meeting you, Jimmy!"<br/><br/>"Break a leg!"<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432419/#Comment_432419" name="Item_416" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-11T20:06:36+00:00" title="May 11, 2014  8:06PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: If You See Her, Say Hello (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>The Most Reverend Doctor James Warren Jones stands outside the Stumbling Tiger, decrying the sin of the people inside. The clubgoers are amused. "I love your act! Will you be doing this every day?"<br/><br/>"Every word and every vision you see in this place is a lie from the pit of Hell! I'll be here every day! <br/><br/>"Ooh! I think he's doing an American black man!" They throw some money at the Rev.<br/><br/>"Irredeemable debauchery from pillar to post! I've never seen anything like that in all my days!" he thunders.<br/><br/>"That's what we're here for!" say the passersby on their way in.<br/><br/>Fortunately for the Rev, since people think he's associated with the club, the Green Gang keep the Shanghai Municipal Police from hauling him in for annoying white people or some similarly idiotic charge.<br/><br/>Around 4 AM, when the club is finally winding down for the evening, a young Chinese waiter comes up to the Rev and says in Shanghailese, "Chiu Zhoutze? Can that be you? What are you doing here in China?"<br/><br/>"You have to understand," says the Rev in the same language, "I'm from Shanghai, <i>West Virginia</i>."<br/><br/>"Riiight. I get it, this is some kind of cover. Don't worry, we'll talk to you soon."<br/><br/>"Be a sport, I know I've been decrying you for being the spawn of Hell--"<br/><br/>"Don't worry, it's just white people being despicable."<br/><br/>"Let's not make it about race, now."<br/><br/>"They started it. Why don't you come around back, we'll give you something to drink."<br/><br/>He takes the Rev to the kitchen entrance. "You'll never believe who this is," says the waiter by way of introduction. "Chiu Zhoutze!"<br/><br/>"No way!" The kitchen staff gather around him. "It's an honor," says one man.<br/><br/>"How is your father?" asks another.<br/><br/>"My father?" says Jim. "I...don't remember."<br/><br/>The head scullery worker slams down a cleaver. "You," he spits. "You sold out to the tongs. Go back to the Lis. Go back the gangsters."<br/><br/>"You can't say that!" says the waiter. "His father was one of the greatest of the Boxers!" <br/><br/>They feed the Rev and walk him out. "Don't worry, we still believe in you."<br/><br/>"That's fine, but you know who you should believe in? Jesus."<br/><br/>"What, that white guy god? We don't care about him."<br/><br/>"I do," says one serious young man. "I believe in Jesus. He's going to save China."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie and Jones stumble back into their pension around 4:30 AM. They collapse on their beds.<br/><br/>Until dawn, when a noise wakes them up. Freddie dashes out and sees that several toughs have kicked in Mwimbe's door and are trying to drag her out.<br/><br/>Freddie fires his pistol at him. Several turn around and drop Mwimbe. One just runs away. One pulls a gun. And two go for...their martial arts.<br/><br/>They shoot at Freddie. He fires back and pegs one of the Boxers, but the other roundhouse kicks him in the head.<br/><br/>Reverend Jones pokes his head out of the door. He sees Mwimbe, collapsed to the floor.<br/><br/>"My black African Princess!" he shouts, and rushes for her. "You can't treat a sister like that!"<br/><br/>The combatants all share a double take. "What the hell?" says one of the Boxers in Shanghailese. Realizing that not only does Freddie have an ally, but that he's <i>clearly crazy as hell</i>, they decide that discretion is the better part of valor and run off.<br/><br/>Mwimbe has apparently been beaten for information. The Rev helps bandage her up in her room.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Monday, 9 November 1925</i><br/><br/>Jimmy wakes up on his cot down in the hospital lab. He fishes the burnt piece of paper he found at the Pension Montigny the day before, pops it into an autoclave for a moment, and then examines it. The scorch marks have faded, and with the help of a stain he can lift a trace of writing from it.<br/><br/>It's in Chinese, of course.<br/><br/>He runs down a nurse. She examines it. "Hrm. This part, is address. Not in Shanghai. This part, is bill. For uniform. Girls' school uniform. Maybe 6 years old."<br/><br/>Jimmy kicks Francis awake, and tells him what he heard the night before.<br/><br/>"Let me understand," says Francis. "Brady? The guy on the run from everyone? Sang at the bar?"<br/><br/>Jimmy shrugs.<br/><br/>"Brady must have lived next door to the assassin," says Francis. "And that guy died horribly. So, he's either hiding, or being protected. By Ho?"<br/><br/>Jimmy takes out the notes Jax left on Brady. "So, he was wounded at Chateau Thierry...the doc said he should have died. Then, Jax caught up with him in Singapore...met someone named Vanessa." He holds up a picture of a young woman. "That really disturbed her. And there's this ship."<br/><br/>It's a picture of a steam yacht, surrounded by junks. The letters DAR can be read on the prow.<br/><br/>"Go check out the charitable foundation Freddie found out about," says Francis. "I'll see if I can track down this ship. And then maybe we can use those connections to find this little girl."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Back at the Pension Freddie, the doctor thanks them for their help. "I'm a little addled," says Mwimbe. "I don't know what happened. They burst in during the night, I think they were cultists."<br/><br/>"How do you know that?" asks the Rev.<br/><br/>"They asked about my books."<br/><br/>"B-b-b-books?" says the Rev. His eyes get a strange glint.<br/><br/>"Very boring books," quickly interjects Mwimbe.<br/><br/>"Romance novels," says Freddie. He notices that the normally unreadable Mwimbe seems genuinely surprised that she was attacked, and a little afraid.<br/><br/>Freddie arranges to move them all to the French Concession. Gilbert makes some arrangements with his underworld contacts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432424/#Comment_432424" name="Item_417" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-11T23:41:57+00:00" title="May 11, 2014 11:41PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, why are they still trusting or working with Mwimbe?

Thank you so much for sharing! I planned (sporadically) an "updated-for-modern-design-concepts" run through of masks for a couple of years that kicked off in March. I swiped some of your ideas that dovetailed nicely with mine (Jax is a woman, Fiasco 1918, Noir-ish feel); there were even several hilarious incidents of unintentional overlap (one of my players, for instance, spent a lot of time in Zanzibar so I had already moved Kenya around to let her showcase that knowledge; I'd already outlined an "Orient Express" connector from Paris =&gt; Venice =&gt; Istanbul), etc.<br/><br/>Your players seem really into it and kicking some narrative ass. I haven't GM'd in over a decade, and my players are all pretty new, but I think we're getting there <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>. I love that your players seem to go into dangerous scenes and act according to the narrative interest\u2014my players have a bit of an adversarial bent, so I'm going to have to be delicate around confrontation until they learn to trust me. We're *almost* to masks proper, five or so sessions in\u2014I arranged a series of prologues to let everyone ease in. I've been recording it and hope to have the time to put together something like this or just to edit the sessions into a podcast.<br/><br/>My big idea was to make The Conspiracy active &amp; dynamic: rather than static encounters in each locale, I have a basic schedule of activity that the PCs can interfere with or unintentionally accelerate, and a conspyramid-style reaction chart for each group. My Conspiracy is a little more internally rivalrous than stuff as written.<br/><br/>At any rate\u2014merci beaucoup, and I'm looking forward to reading through the end. I have guesses about Mwimbe and Calcutta that I'm looking forward to!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432446/#Comment_432446" name="Item_420" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-12T08:04:38+00:00" title="May 12, 2014  8:04AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/hypomodern">@hypomodern</a>: thank you so much for that praise! I'm blushing!<br/><br/>This campaign started, basically, with the goal of me not needing to do any prep--I could prep it all out in the months I took off from GMing after my Pathfinder game. It didn't quite work that way, but I still wing big chunks of each session; my basic prep is that I visualize a couple of scenes I think might be cool, set up the bread crumb to them, and make sure I let them go if the players don't go that way.<br/><br/>My players are generally quite willing to keep pushing the plot, it's true. Of them, JP is the most willing to just do stuff--JP is a lot of fun to have in the group, and a GMs friend that way. OP is the most narratively aware, I think, or at least the one most likely to have a narrative arc in sight while RPing (take, for example, the shattered pillar in the last episode.) FP is a bit conservative--a classic Robin Laws tactician--but has done pretty well at having Freddie do stupid things because Freddie just doesn't know better. CP and PP tended to be the most cautious--the interminable planning to rescue Gardner in Episode IV is the best example of that--but CP also comes up with some the campaign's most shocking and awesome images--the mystic Tommy gun, and a spot of body horror at the end of Episode XVI that had me squirming with shock and delight.<br/><br/>When the history of the campaign is written, as I've said, making Jax a woman was probably the single most important change. It really opened stuff up in unexpected ways (most notably, her having been Freddie's fiancee) and just...I dunno. It made it easier for me to change other stuff, I think, and look at more interesting combinations.<br/><br/>Of course, I also made the women of the campaign stand out a lot more than in the echt text--most notably with Hypatia, of course. There just was no way that I wanted to have her just be the baby vessel, especially since body horror isn't really my gig. (Had enough of that in my real life to last a lifetime, thanks.) Conflating her with Nitocris was one of those ideas that just came to me, and I'm glad it did; she was fun to play, and the players were suitably mystified and frightened of her, especially because of her ambiguous relationship to the Conspiracy.<br/><br/>As for the Conspiracy, it was actually pretty dynamic, behind the scenes--its just that some of that dynamism was tearing each other's throats out. Hypatia basically engineered the death of Shakti, and Gavigan for that matter; Huston has mentioned that M'weru has some plan involving the PCs that he thinks is crazy (he just wanted to kill them outright.) Sir Aubrey...well, I have an idea for him. He'll finally see the light of day in the big finale this weekend.<br/><br/>I thought about using a Conspyramid, but I already had a chart with the relationships between the principals so it didn't seem to be necessary. It's a great idea, though, and I'd encourage other folks doing the conversion to look into it.<br/><br/>I'd also suggest doing what I did and adopting the NBA Sources; it's possible to do the whole "correspondence with my Sources" thing, but I think Masks benefits from having PCs who are relatively mobile. It also allows me to be aggressive in my Stability checks, given that they have more ways to refresh in-session.<br/><br/>TL;DR. Executive summary: thank you so much for your comment, and I'm glad I was able to help out in any small way!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432481/#Comment_432481" name="Item_421" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-12T20:12:24+00:00" title="May 12, 2014  8:12PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: If You See Her, Say Hello (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Francis heads down to the docks and spends a long wearisome time crawling through various registries, agencies, logbooks, and writs. Eventually he discovers that the boat in the picture is named the <i>Dark Mistress</i>, British registry, owned by an "Alfred Penhurst." The parallel to Aubrey Penhew strikes him immediately. He also finds out that it has been making regular trips all around the Indian Ocean, especially between Calcutta and Shanghai--and occasionally ties up at the slip registered to Ho Fong Shipping.<br/><br/><i>[I handed out that darn picture in the </i>first bloody session<i> but no one ever asked me about it until now.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy heads out to find out more about the charitable organization Isoge tipped them to. He heads to the local Anglican church and eventually discovers they fund hospitals throughout the Empire. Brady's papers singled out two of these that share the same campus--St. Howard's, and St. Phillip's. One of them is a mental institution, Jimmy notes.<br/><br/><br/>Freddie asks Dr. Mwimbe about what she was being questioned about. She tells him that they were interested in her books and artifacts. <br/><br/>"Rather specific information, don't you think?"<br/><br/>"Yes. I think it is a safe bet that the cult knows we are here. I...I fear I have not been completely honest with you, Mr. Blakely."<br/><br/>"I've known that for a while. Is this the part where you say you're a cultist and stab me?"<br/><br/>"No, but...I was a cultist. In my youth I joined an occult organization. When I discovered they were not actually interested in ending imperialism, but merely the worship of dark evil gods, I left. But they have long memories."<br/><br/>"Do you feel better for telling me?"<br/><br/>"I suppose. I apologize for endangering you...I hope I have provided some small assistance, from time to time."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Rev is straightening up Mwimbe's room. The porters at the pension are quietly respectful.<br/><br/>"Mr. Chiu?" one says. "If you ever need protection, just let us know."<br/><br/>"What would I need protection from."<br/><br/>"No way," they murmur. "I told you he was tough," says one. "Just like his dad!" says another.<br/><br/>"What was my father ever doing in Shanghai," wonders the Rev to himself.<br/><br/>"Chiu Wei-fan and Li Hong were the two greatest of all the Boxers in Shanghai," says one.<br/><br/>"I'd like to hear some stories of that someday," says the Rev.<br/><br/>The porters take him out for lunch. The Rev does some light preaching: "Let me read to you from Tentacles, Chapter 13..."<br/><br/><br/><br/>That night they reconvene at a charming French restaurant in the Concession. Freddie recognizes from the description of the uniform that Jimmy has been put together that whoever it was for probably attends a high-end convent school. <br/><br/><i>[He had the highest Credit Rating.]</i><br/><br/>"Perhaps we could drive by and assassinate Ho Fong," muses Freddie. "No, that's a ridiculous idea."<br/><br/><i>[When FP and I played </i>Masks<i> together, that's exactly what we did.

I've been attacked by lizard people who bit me, and aliens who smacked me, and now there's this sucking thing hanging around. I'm tired of being a punching bag."<br/><br/>"Like those bullet-proof vests the G-Men sometimes wear?"<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>Jimmy explains about recent advances in bulletproof clothing. "They're mostly silk with a metal plate..."<br/><br/>"So, like the kind of armor the Chinese have been making for centuries?"<br/><br/>"Not exactly but...oh, I see. Maybe we can find someone...and the Japanese had something that worked against muskets..."<br/><br/>"And mystical runes. For protection."<br/><br/>"What?" <br/><br/>"You've got the books, Jimmy. I'm tired of getting blindsided by events. I have enough weaponry. It's time for armor."<br/><br/>They decide to start hitting up the illegal weapons merchants in the city. Jimmy locates a spell with the help of Noor that might help...the <i>Elder Sign</i>...<br/><br/><i>[Bargain spends, and a point of Streetwise per suit. It looks like...well, sorta like Chinese armor, but acts like bulletproof vests, so two points of armor but it costs a point of Athletics to wear.<br/><br/>Jimmy was able to cast the Elder Sign with the help of some Stability loans from the rest of the party, because it costs a point of Stability </i>rating<i> to cast. They cast the Elder Sign on the inside of the armor, so that they don't have to walk around with a highly visible mystical rune on the surface.<br/><br/>All this took about a week to take care of, just getting this out of the way.]</i><br/><br/>After that disturbing conversation, Jimmy turns back the disturbing parts of his books. He searches for the being that could leave such a wound. And he finds it.<br/><br/><i>Then I oped the Seal and Call'd it forthe...the hideous Star Vampyre. Hidden were it from site, save when it Fedde, for then the Gore wouldst spill upon it and reveal its Glorious forme...and ye shall knowe it, by the sound it maketh, verily like unto the Titter of a small Childe...</i><br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos spend by JP, three points of Stability since this is a pretty tough Mythos critter.]</i><br/><br/>Folks spend some time recuperating. Francis goes out into the Concession and ties one on with Guy. Jimmy strokes his rabbit's foot meditatively, and tells Noor the story of how he got it.<br/><br/>"Oh. I never heard that story while I was alive. I guess it will be <i>much</i> better now that I'm dead."<br/><br/><br/><br/>They also beat the bushes, trying to learn more about Ho Fong. Francis finds out that he has a reputation in Shanghai; no one messes with him. He wasn't always scary, however--up until five years ago, he was considered a bit milquetoast. He has operations in Calcutta, one of the only Indian cities with a Chinatown. He has a sixteen-year old daughter who is involved in the business to an unusual degree.<br/><br/>Jimmy finds out that Ho Fong is laying off people right and left, and getting ready to move his operations.<br/><br/><i>[Oral History use by OP and JP.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie decides to send his card to Ho Fong and request an interview. After a few days, arrangements are made to meet at a restaurant outside the International Zone. Francis and Jimmy plan to pay a call on the warehouse that same night.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Monday, 16 November 1925</i><br/><br/>Freddie brings the Rev with him, for moral backup or distraction.<br/><br/><i>[Me: I know you guys are player characters and have agency, but--you could have the party Face make the meet, and the party thugs--er, action heroes--go to the warehouse.<br/><br/>FP: Excellent. I'll bring the former party thug now face with me.<br/><br/>OP: And I'll bring the former party face now thug with </i>me.<i><br/><br/>Me: Wait...that is kinda how it went, isn't it?]</i><br/><br/>They are only waiting for a short while when a stout Chinese man in his fifties, wearing a well-tailored grey English suit, enters. With him is a teenaged girl in a cheongsam dress.<br/><br/>"Count Orlok?"<br/><br/>"Ah, Mr. Ho?"<br/><br/>"No! Merely his barrister. This is his daughter, Ho Hsi-tzu."<br/><br/>"Charmed. Is--is this Chiu Zhoutsu?"<br/><br/>"He goes by the Reverend Jones."<br/><br/>"It is important to have an alias."<br/><br/>Freddie studies Miss Ho carefully, but he can't tell if she's human, or as he suspects, an alien wearing a human suit.<br/><br/>"My Chinese is a bit disreputable..." says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Feel free to continue in English. I am well-versed in several European languages."<br/><br/>"At one point I spoke some French, but it has escaped me."<br/><br/>"<i>Quelle dommage.</i> I understand you are interested in investing with us. Right now we are in the process of merging with a Calcutta-based company."<br/><br/>"Perhaps I know it."<br/><br/>"I would be surprised if you do--Thakur Shipping?"<br/><br/>"Dil Chandra Thakur!

Francis, who had been planting "O'Donnell cocktails", zaps one with the lightning gun. Soon the warehouse is burning rapidly. As it collapses, they notice an armored storeroom underneath the weak spot on the stairs Jimmy found. They also notice a hatch that led down from it to the water--much too low for a boat.<br/><br/><i>[Molotov hadn't been linked yet to gasoline filled bottles, thus the moniker.

He discovers that the uniform was for a convent school--the Auguste Derleth School for Girls.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Francis head to St. Howard's and St. Phillip's. Francis uses his medical credentials to get a meeting with the hospital administrator, Sir John Watson.<br/><br/><i>[Medicine spend by OP.]</i><br/><br/>"Dr. O'Donnell," says the rather doddering Watson. "Who are you looking for? Jack Brady? Doesn't ring a bell. Ah, Vanessa? What a charming photograph. Can't say I recognize her, but I don't know all our patients. But even if I did, I'm afraid confidentiality is extremely important--you can't just go snooping around like some sort of consulting detective, after all."<br/><br/>"Well, I'm on an extended case for the Shanghai Municipal Police." Francis hands over his card. "I'm just trying to do the right thing. A man is dead."<br/><br/>"Unfortunate. Far too many corpses in my life--I was in Afghanistan, old man.

The school is not particularly large. Freddie keeps up a friendly banter, asking about faculty size, what finishing schools the girls go to, and then:<br/><br/>"And how many families of repute, and how many...scholarships."<br/><br/>"We have a generous grant form the church and locals, and that allows us to take on five or six girls.

For a moment he feels as if some one was watching him, but he shrugs it off.<br/><br/><i>[Jack Brady has a +3 Stealth modifier; no one actually caught him watching them.]</i><br/><br/>After a few hours of preaching, he has against all odds made a couple of converts--two young longshoremen. Fan is Chinese, Ahmad Malaysian. <br/><br/>"We wish to follow you, Sifu. Teach us more."<br/><br/>They are speaking a Malay-Cantonese pidgin that Jones can barely follow. He sets about teaching them Latin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie reports back that there's only five or six little girls they need to look at. In describing the school to Jimmy, he comes to the realization that something wasn't quite...<i>Christian</i> about the church on the school grounds. Something...protective, as if it was aware of the larger world, and designed to protect its inhabitants.<br/><br/><i>[OP: So there's a blue box in one of the stained glass windows...<br/><br/>Me: I haven't decided if we're </i>that<i> post-modern...that may be climbing out on a limb I can't crawl back from...]</i><br/><br/>Freddie, knowing that he's probably been observed by Brady, decides to head out into the dark alleys of Singapore, hoping to draw him out. Francis, knowing that he's likely to be murdered by either Brady or run of the mill toughs, follows Freddie. Several times they feel eyes on themselves, but they never catch sight of Brady.<br/><br/><i>[FP came close, rolled a 6, but the TN was 7.]</i><br/><br/><i>Thursday, 26 November 1925</i><br/><br/>Francis and Jimmy are scheduled to meet Dr. Seward; Freddie and the Rev decide to tag along. But first, Freddie decides to investigate the school more. <br/><br/>The problem arises, of course, that he doesn't have access to their records, and is worried about drawing attention to the girl.<br/><br/>"If only I knew a master of disguise," he mutters.<br/><br/>"What did you say?" asks Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Sayyyy...."<br/><br/>They put together a disguise for Jimmy. "I think some sort of Catholic priest should do nicely," says Freddie.<br/><br/>Jimmy pulls out a small hat with a pom-pom on the top. "How's a Monsignor work for you?"<br/><br/><i>[JP got a 9  on his disguise roll.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Rev greets his disciples, who have been curled up on the street outside his hotel. "Boys, what's the worst den of debauchery you know of in this town?"<br/><br/>"Fang's" they say in unison, without hesitation.<br/><br/>"Then that's where we're going to go preach."<br/><br/>"Great!" says Fan. "Say, Sifu, can we beat up the sinners if they don't listen to the Word?"<br/><br/>"In fact, you may not!"<br/><br/>"Oh. Nuts, that's as bad as Buddhism."<br/><br/>"The Iman said it would be okay," says Ahmad. "Well, Sifu seems to know what he's doing."<br/><br/>The Rev preaches the message of Christianity--turning the other cheek, how Jesus could have kicked the Romans' butt but chose not to, just as he did when he fought Typhon...<br/><br/>His disciples draw pictures of the battle between Typhon and Christ, that the Rev hopes to turn into a flyer. Ahmad is the...better...artist, and Fan puts some calligraphy on the side. The whole effect looks like a poster for a Chinese opera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie arrives at the Auguste Derleth school. The headmistress greets him, and then catches sight of Jimmy in his Monsignor outfit. "Count Orlok, how nice to...oh. Father! Are you with the Count?"<br/><br/>"I had the good fortune to run into the Monsignor," says Freddie. <br/><br/>"<i>Deo Gratia</i>," mutters the headmistress. Jimmy, who has no Latin, merely nods.<br/><br/>"The Monsignor has come down with a terrible cold," continues Freddie smoothly, "so if he needs to say anything I'll speak up for him."<br/><br/>"Sorry to hear that, Father."<br/><br/>"It happens," croaks Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Monsignor is very interested in your good works, and would like to look over your records," says Freddie.<br/><br/>The headmistress is happy to take the Monsignor to the records room, and after a moment's uncomfortableness, agrees to let Freddie sit in with him. An Irish priest accompanies them into the room.<br/><br/>A cursory check of the records shows that of the five scholarship students, two are too old. Of the three remaining, one is French, one is named Janet, the daughter of a local consul, and one is a young girl named Mirabelle Lovecraft.<br/><br/>The mother is listed as Vanessa Lovecraft, and the father as John Black. Freddie notices that the girl has an excuse to leave today to visit her mother.<br/><br/>Freddie pounds Jimmy's foot. They make their excuses, and decide to lurk around and wait for a girl to leave the school. Jimmy sheds his Monsignor costume.<br/><br/>Around noon, a nun and a little girl in a fancy dress--not her pinafore uniform--come walking out of the school and heading up the street. The girl sings a merry French song as she skips along.<br/><br/>Jimmy stays on her tail, while Freddie heads up to St. Howard's and St. Phillip's with the Rev. The Rev's cassock seems to be hissing sometimes, but Freddie tries to ignore it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432802/#Comment_432802" name="Item_428" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-18T20:03:15+00:00" title="May 18, 2014  8:03PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2014 8:09PM by Aviatrix.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: If You See Her, Say Hello (Part 8)</b><br/><br/><br/>Sir John Seward, MD, welcomes them into his office. "Dr. O'Donnell, Count Orlok...and...oh."<br/><br/>"Brother Jones," says the Rev, offering his hand. A snake uncoils and almost wraps itself around Seward's arm.<br/><br/>Freddie notice Seward looking at him rather sharply, almost as if he recognizes him.<br/><br/>"Please secure your reptile," says Seward with a remarkable amount of sang-froid. They all sit. "What an interesting case," says Seward, glancing at Jones. "Are you here to have him diagnosed?"<br/><br/>"Of course not," says Freddie, broadly nodding his head.<br/><br/>"I see. Reverend, would you care to stroll in the garden with two of our interns?"<br/><br/>"That depends. Are they willing to listen to my message?"<br/><br/>"I assure you, Reverend, they will hang upon your every word."<br/><br/><br/>The Rev, and a couple of young interns head out into the garden, leaving Freddie and Francis alone with Dr. Seward. Freddie notices that Seward's reaction--buried under a very controlled demeanor--seems to be one of shock and surprise at seeing him.<br/><br/>"We're here about a young woman named Vanessa," says Francis. "Vanessa Lovecraft."<br/><br/>"Of course, Doctor. Ward 3."<br/><br/>"She's <i>here</i>?"<br/><br/>"You did not know this?"<br/><br/>"On the contrary," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"She's been with us almost five years now," says Seward. "Her case is...well, she's fragile, and for various reasons her man of business insists she stay here under the calming influence of our care, until she is ready to reenter society."<br/><br/>"Could you put us in contact with him?"<br/><br/>"He tends to show up without warning every month or so, with the money to pay us. Rather unusual for a business manager, if you ask me--a bit more rough trade. But he does seem to care very much for her."<br/><br/>"Is he American by any chance?" asks Freddie.<br/><br/>"One of those accents, hard to place, but if I had to wager I'd say American, yes."<br/><br/>"You practice the talking cure, of course," asks Francis.<br/><br/>"My dear fellow, I was practicing it practically before Freud."<br/><br/>"Could we see your notes?"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid those must remain confidential. I've thought a few times about writing this case up, but I'm afraid her man of business is rather...emphatic upon her continued incognito status. I brought it up once. Took a week to get my office repaired. But I could arrange a meeting with the young lady, as a professional courtesy to a fellow practitioner. I'll set it up at once. In the meantime, I'd like to have a few words with the Count if you don't mind."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"...and Nothing shall in any way hurt you!" quotes the Rev to the interns as they lead him out into the garden. <br/><br/>"Tell us about the snakes."<br/><br/>"I have three here today. This is Freddie, Jimmy, and this one is Noor. I don't know why I named her that, it seemed important for some reason."<br/><br/>"Of course there had to be three snakes," says one intern. "It's the anima, the animus, and--"<br/><br/>"Don't give me that Jungian crap! Remember, we're going to write the paper together!"<br/><br/><i>[CP: Are any of the other patients showing an interest?<br/><br/>Me: Let's see, you're bringing a religious delusion into a psychiatric hospital. Of course some are. And a lot of the interns are gathering around as well.]</i><br/><br/>The Rev singles out a nervous looking patient. "You, sir! Are you in need of salvation?" <br/><br/>A snake uncoils around his hand as he says this.<br/><br/>"Tell me my lord!" stammers the man. "Are you one of the flying ones from Yuggoth?"<br/><br/>"I don't fly! Take the snake and hold it! If it bites you, your faith isn't strong enough!"<br/><br/>"Ow!"<br/><br/>"Try harder!"<br/><br/>A couple of burly attendants approach the Rev from behind, holding a strait jacket, but the interns wave him off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Outside, Jimmy follows the little girl as she walks directly towards St. Howard's and St. Phillip's.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Your name isn't really Count Orlok, is it?" asks Seward. "What name have you been going by?"<br/><br/>"Most people seem to call me 'Bastard'. Is there a question, Dr. Seward?"<br/><br/>"We...weren't allowed to know, of course, because if we knew we'd endanger you...but...my God, you're the spitting image of him."<br/><br/>"That's all a bit vague."<br/><br/>"You look just like my old friend, Arthur Longwood, the fourth Earl Godalming."<br/><br/>Freddie runs through his mental peerage list. He remembers that the fourth earl died childless, leaving his Surrey title vacant. In fact he died...about...why, that must have been close to his birth--<br/><br/>"I see now that my Aunts have been lying to me my whole life," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Oh God, they put you with your mother's family? How horrid."<br/><br/>"What exactly happened?"<br/><br/>"Well, there were the six of us back then--there was me, and Arthur, and Wilhelmina--"<br/><br/>"Oh, you've met her? A colossal, annoying control-freak."<br/><br/>"Less then. Her husband, Jonathon--"<br/><br/>"She's <i>married</i>?"<br/><br/>"Not anymore, but she has two children if I remember properly. Then poor Quincy, and my old mentor, Dr. van Helsing. The thing is, though, that once you encounter the powers of darkness there's never just <i>one</i> of them. And once you've been initiated into that world, it's never easy to come back. And that's what led us to Cairo. After that, and that book by that ridiculous Irishman--we convinced him to kill off Quincy in the book; as far as I know he's still out there. Mina, of course, has her own schemes. But you, Freddie, are the son of my oldest and best friend. I have something to show you."<br/><br/>He takes Freddie down into the wards, and opens the judas-gate. Inside the cell is poor mad Billy.<br/><br/>"I left him in Tanganyika."<br/><br/>"Really? He was a different man when I knew him. Frederick William Abernathy was one of the finest graduates of the Coldstream Guards. He was your father's bodyguard. But I'm afraid that night in Surrey broke him rather badly."<br/><br/><i>Dear God,</i> thinks Freddie. <i>That's why they call me...</i><br/><br/>"We never expected old Arthur would get married after Lucy," says Seward. "That's why he decided to retire to his estate. We should have expected some vengeance after Cairo. After they both died...well, Mina and Jonathon weren't together any longer, so we all just drifted apart."<br/><br/>"Perhaps we should go meet Miss Lovecraft," says Freddie. "Her daughter is coming today, I believe."<br/><br/>"Ah, yes. Mirabelle."<br/><br/>Freddie of course has lost his French, or he would recognize what her name means in that language: <i>miracle</i>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Outside, the Reverend sees a young woman in a white dress, sitting alone on a bench under a tree.<br/><br/>"Do you have Faith!" he thunders at her.<br/><br/>"No," says Vanessa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432842/#Comment_432842" name="Item_429" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T19:48:59+00:00" title="May 19, 2014  7:48PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2014 7:53PM by Aviatrix.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: If You See Her, Say Hello (Part 9)</b><br/><br/><i>[OP had to leave early, which explains why he wasn't around for the rest of this; we decided on what happened to him after the session.]</i><br/><br/>Francis is about to step into the garden when he freezes. Something...just at the edge of his vision.<br/><br/>He spins around reaching for his pistol, but too late: a fist crashes into his face and he stumbles backward. Whoever punched him springs on top of him, jamming a handkerchief over his nose and mouth.<br/><br/><i>Chloroform</i>, he thinks. It is his last coherent thought for a long time.<br/><br/><br/>Mirabelle dashes into the garden, followed by Jimmy. Freddie grabs him by the neck.<br/><br/>"James, I think this is the time we should take a good hard look around."<br/><br/>"You...called me <i>James</i>."<br/><br/>"I've turned over a new leaf, Jimmy."<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little girl dashes up to the woman in the white dress. "Mummy!" she says. She stares at the Reverend Jones.<br/><br/>"Are those snakes?" she asks.<br/><br/>"They're God's snakes."<br/><br/>"Can I pet one?"<br/><br/>"I don't care."<br/><br/>Freddie and Jimmy stroll up.<br/><br/>Vanessa watches them with a troubled look on her face. "You all are strangers to me...I'm not supposed to trust strangers."<br/><br/>"Not to worry, my dear," says Freddie. "We're hoping to meet your protector."<br/><br/>"I'm not supposed to talk about him."<br/><br/>"No need. We're figuring he'd show up on his own." He and Dr. Seward sit down next to Vanessa.<br/><br/>On cue, Jimmy feels something cold, hard, and gun-shaped poke him in the ribs. "Don't move," hisses a voice in his ear. "Put your hands where I can see them, nice and slow. Now go sit down under the tree. But not near her."<br/><br/>Freddie glances up and sees Jimmy walking towards them with his hands in the air. "Ah, hello."<br/><br/>"You fellas have been spending a lot of time trying to find me."<br/><br/>"Jack," says Vanessa. "I'm scared."<br/><br/>"Don't worry. I just need to check these guys out."<br/><br/>"And have you determined that we smash conspiracies and are ruthless individuals? Count Orlok."<br/><br/>"That's not your real name. You," he gestures towards the Rev, "You're just a basket of crazy. But you there, I like."<br/><br/>"Name's Jimmy."<br/><br/>"We'll just wait on shaking hands. Tell these interns to back the hell off."<br/><br/>"Excellent idea," says Seward, beating a hasty retreat.<br/><br/>Brady waits until they are gone. "Took care of your gunsel. He'll be fine. I don't like killing people unless it's necessary."<br/><br/>"I got involved in all of this because of Jax," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"That crazy broad?"<br/><br/>"My ex-fiancee, yes."<br/><br/>"Poking around in stuff, got her killed."<br/><br/>"We ended up in touch with your boyfriend's sister."<br/><br/>"Erica? She don't like me very well, her and that Grey guy."<br/><br/>"To be honest, we were hoping for some direction, fighting this cult conspiracy. We took care of Shakhti Bey..."<br/><br/>"I didn't know Shakhti that well."<br/><br/>"We met Hypatia--"<br/><br/>"Wait a minute, you <i>met</i> Patty?"<br/><br/>"She seems to have the power of some sort of pagan goddess."<br/><br/>"They dropped a building on her," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"So this is supposed to make me want to put the lives of Mirabelle and Vanessa in your hands? I gotta tell ya, between you and snake boy over here, you're not doing a good job at being convincing."<br/><br/>"We just need some help. Ho Fong and his daughter are moving to Calcutta--"<br/><br/>"We burnt down her warehouse," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You guys did that? I don't like the Fongs, or that Thakur lady."<br/><br/>"I appreciate how you protected your daughter. That was rather clever. Sorry to bring you out of retirement, old boy."<br/><br/>"I haven't been retired. Five years I been on the run, and nobody's found me, and then you yahoos waltz in. Like it's easy. I guess Taro sent you. Must have trusted you for some reason."<br/><br/>He turn to the girl. "Mirabelle, honey, go over and play by the fountain." He waits for her to leave. "So I guess you want to hear the whole thing, about the expedition and everything. I guess if Patty didn't tell you anything she's not as bad as I thought; you don't strike the kinda deal she made without being pretty bad."<br/><br/>"She seems to be working for Mr. N."<br/><br/>"I remember their relationship as being more contentions.

I got into a little fix with the local bulls, they were gonna stick a gas chamber charge on me. Roger swooped in with lawyers and got me out of it.<br/><br/>"I knew Roger was bent, but in another kinda way. I was okay with it. We had an affection for each other...<br/><br/>"So when Roger got that crazy idea, chase after that M'weru lady, I wanted to stay with him, take care of him. He was into a lot of stuff back then, it was all nuts--pretending he and Patty were an item...I mean, I'm a tough guy, but it eats your heart out a little, seeing your...you know...parading around with people.<br/><br/>"Then he told me it was all because of his shrink, that's how Patty ended up going with us. He said Patty and Huston were related, it was his leverage on the Doc. And Penhew? One of those guys, pleasant, absent-minded, but he was into some stuff...I don't even want to think about it. And there was the whole thing he did in Ireland...<br/><br/>"Penhew and Erica were tight, though. When Roger and Erica's parents died, Penhew was there to help them out. We thought maybe he and Erica would get together. Then Rog told me about his dreams." <br/><br/>Brady pauses. "Hey, Vanessa? Why don't you go over with Mirabelle. Got some things to discuss you wouldn't find pleasant."<br/><br/>He watches her leave with a strange expression on his face. "So, the thing is. Roger was bent, in a kind of different way, right? And what M'weru was offering him, was the thing he'd wanted all his life. So we went to Egypt--you've seen it, the temple? The one of the female pharaoh they dug up? I hear Penhew sent another 'expedition' there. So...we went there, opened the gate...and went back to Egypt."<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"Yeah, twenty-five, thirty-five hundred years ago...I couldn't read the language or anything. So Aubrey got to be the Black Pharaoh, ruling by the might of the Black Wind--you know, <i>Him</i>. You know who I'm talking about. We came back--the legends say the Pharaoh got killed, but <i>He</i> just brought us back..."<br/><br/>"And that's when Hypatia..." begins Freddie.<br/><br/>"Yeah. I mean, <i>He</i> had this idea, that she was going to bear his child, but Patty didn't want none of that. She said, you're teaching Aubrey all this magic, you're going to show him how to remake humanity, why not remake me? And I guess <i>He</i> saw something in her. They came to an accommodation, I don't know what--afterward, she don't talk to us no more. And Rog, he, he got what he wanted--"<br/><br/>"Which was to become Vanessa," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Got it in one, Chief. It can't be the same between us no more, cause that's not my thing. But I still...you know. You can keep loving someone, sometimes."<br/><br/>"And the child? Is that yours, or Aubrey's?"<br/><br/>"That's Vanessa's kid. That's what I know. And that's kinda the story."<br/><br/>"And Vanessa? What does she remember?"<br/><br/>"Some of it? I don't like to bring it up."<br/><br/>"Is she in here for protection or treatment?"<br/><br/>"Both? She's, you know, <i>fragile</i>. The thing is, <i>Him</i>? He don't give nothing for free. Oh, he'll give you what you want, but never quite the way you want it. She's mostly fine, and when Mirabelle comes, she's really good. If I could take her someplace where I knew they'd take care of us, and nobody was trying to kill us..."<br/><br/>"So what's Penhew up to?"<br/><br/>"Good question. Aubrey always had the idea of remaking humanity, and Huston got caught up in that."<br/><br/>"Oh, I nearly killed Huston," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Good for you, pally."<br/><br/>"I was in an alien body at the time."<br/><br/>"You know, there was a time when something like that might have phazed me...Penhew's got somebody helping him, there's way too much money being thrown around. The Cult of the Black Pharaoh is one of the oldest cults, got a lot of higher-ups in it."<br/><br/>"And Miss M'weru? Is she Ho Fong's daughter, via magic?"<br/><br/>"I thought about that...dunno. She was always weird, wearing that mask in public and everything..."<br/><br/>Freddie offers a picture of Mwimbe.<br/><br/>"Dunno...could be? I...my memory's a bit fogged from back then."<br/><br/>"Do we all just look alike to you?" demands the Rev.<br/><br/>"What the hell is he talking about?"<br/><br/>Jimmy unfolds Huston's map. "This is a thing," says Brady. "There's the clearing, Vanessa and I were already gone...there's Irem, where we came back from Egypt...Calcutta, I knew about. You say Huston was in Australia? So there's that...Kerguelen Island? What the hell is that? All I know is that they're moving a lot of heavy equipment around, and they got some special fast boat--can't be the <i>Dark Mistress</i>, something else..."<br/><br/>Jimmy looks at the map, which is upside down to him. He notices for the first time that the points on the map could form a pentacle...in fact, rather like the one they put on the inside of their armor--the Elder Sign, the sign of protection.<br/><br/>But, it would be upside-down. As if...it wasn't meant to protect...but...<br/><br/>Defeat protection. Open things up.<br/><br/>"Looks like they're trying to destroy the Earth," intones Freddie.<br/><br/>"Yeah, we know the date," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/> "January 14th, 1926. There's going to be an eclipse over the Indian Ocean. Maybe there's something in the center of the star..."<br/><br/>Jimmy looks up suddenly. There were a lot of interns walking around--he had barely paid attention.<br/><br/>But now he doesn't see Mirabelle anywhere.<br/><br/>Vanessa begins to scream.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432844/#Comment_432844" name="Item_431" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T19:51:34+00:00" title="May 19, 2014  7:51PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would just like to note in passing that our own Lisa Padol figured out who Vanessa was right after I posted Episode I or II.

Jack, did I do something wrong?"<br/><br/>"These people played with her head for years," spits Brady. "That Huston guy, who knows what he stuck in there."<br/><br/>Jimmy grabs a doctor to take care of Vanessa. Freddie canvasses the bystanders.<br/><br/>One of the patients talks to him. "What I saw--and keep in mind, the people here tell me that I'm not always good at knowing what's real, so you'll have to tell me if it's right. Like, I think that guy has a snake wrapped around his arm."<br/><br/>"He has three."<br/><br/>"That's <i>real</i>? Wow.

Why, I'm the Emperor Napoleon."<br/><br/><i>[Oral History use by FP.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy finds out that whoever grabbed Mirabelle had rented a cab and left it waiting outside until they came back with the girl. Brady is upset. "I stuck your gunsel in the trunk of one of those cabs, nobody was in it. I think it was the one they brought."<br/><br/>"Probably headed to the waterfront," says Jimmy. <br/><br/>The Rev summons his disciples. "The devil has shown himself! He kidnapped a little girl!"<br/><br/>"How can we help, Sifu?"<br/><br/>"Go back to this address, find a Frenchman named Gilbert and have him meet us at the docks."<br/><br/><br/>They head down to the waterfront. With his usual skill, Freddie finds a fried shrimp vendor who saw a girl in a white dress being dragged around by some tough looking fellows.<br/><br/><i>[Oral History spend to find the right guy right away.]</i><br/><br/>Fan arrives. "Sifu, I couldn't get into the hotel, what with all those police surrounding it."<br/><br/>The Rev and Fan talk to some longshoremen. "Yeah, some guys were looking for guys to do a job," says one in rapid-fire Cantonese. "Some muscle to head down, hit a hotel, and drag this [racial slur] down here. Kill anyone who tried to stop them. Seemed weird, what's in a cheap hotel like that, and why get a [racial slur] when you can get one for free in Africa!"<br/><br/><i>[Streetwise spend by CP.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy quickly navigates the extremely orderly Singapore police bureaucracy. A Malay in the harbor patrol saw two men with a little girl and an African lady, along with a couple of crates. "They had all their paperwork filled out in advance, very efficient."<br/><br/><i>[Bureaucracy spend by JP.]</i><br/><br/>A policeman finds Freddie. "Count Orlok? Can you come with me?"<br/><br/>"May I ask why?"<br/><br/>"Your servant's been hospitalized."<br/><br/>"My other servant has been kidnapped, and is somewhere on the docks."<br/><br/>"That's a very serious charge to make."<br/><br/>Freddie flags Jimmy to bring over the Malaysian official he's been talking to. "This man saw the whole thing," he says.<br/><br/>"What? They had their paperwork all filled out."<br/><br/>"Very suspicious."<br/><br/>"Very efficient!"<br/><br/>"I suppose it's somewhat suspicious," says the constable. "I will talk to the harbormaster and get some men on this."<br/><br/><i>[And so FP left his Solace in the hands of the GM.]</i><br/><br/>They race down the waterfront. At the end of the docks, they see a steam yacht tied up to the pier. The name on the bow is <i>Dark Mistress</i>.<br/><br/>As they approach, a machine gun on the deck of the ship opens up. Freddie, Jimmy and the Rev hit the deck. The constable collapses with a sucking chest wound.<br/><br/>Brady starts firing back. "They're too far away for me to use...the thing!"<br/><br/>Jimmy starts looking for the explosives the Rev was forced to carry with them by Francis.<br/><br/><i>[FP, as Freddie, trying to set up a long throw of explosives: Does it surprise you that I spent a year playing American football?<br/><br/>Me:...it does, especially since the forward pass wasn't legal yet.<br/><br/>Still, FP and CP spent like 12 points on a preparedness roll. So...okay, the Rev had a satchel charge.<br/></i><br/><br/>Jimmy primes the charge, whirls it around his head, and launches it at the boat. <br/><br/><i>[And JP spent 10 points of Athletics, rolled a 15.]</i><br/><br/>Bullets chew up the deck around him. One catches him in the shoulder and drops him.<br/><br/>The charge impacts the water near the screws of the steam yacht. There is a horrific grinding noise and smoke begins to pour out of the stern of the ship. However, it continues to pull away from the docks.<br/><br/>"We sent for a destroyer to stop them," shouts a constable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon enough, a grey warship approaches the <i>Dark Mistress</i>. Freddie and company grab a rowboat and begin to row towards them.<br/><br/>They watch as British sailors board the yacht.<br/><br/>They watch as the crew of the <i>Dark Mistress</i>, a little girl, and an African woman are brought back on board the destroyer.<br/><br/>Then they watch open-mouthed as the destroyer puts out to sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not long after a steam launch from the harbor patrol heaves to next to them. "Count Orlok? Reverend Jones? James Wright? I'm afraid I must place you all under arrest," barks an official-looking man.<br/><br/>"What are the charges?" asks Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Um...high treason and terrorism," says the man. "Apparently you threw a bomb at a ship owned by an agent of the British Crown. Wow. Never arrested a terrorist before! And quite a throw, according to the constables. You are to be commended on your terroristic skills. Fear not, lads, you'll receive full and fair Singapore justice."<br/><br/>Jimmy sits down, clutching his wounds.

You want to know the lesson about listening to snakes in a garden? Then read the Good Book--you'll find out it's not the right thing to do."<br/><br/>"I know that story. They have always gotten that wrong. Adam and Eve ate the fruit, because that is their natural condition. This story is always misinterpreted. The serpent was not evil, he was teaching them the right way to speak to God. The serpent told them the way to avoid all these indignities. You would never grow old, never die, but you would never <i>learn</i>. So pain? Yes. Suffering? Yes. Sacrifice? Yes. But--they became as God said, and were like gods."<br/><br/>"God told them, you have what you want, just don't eat of that tree. But that damn dirty snake--sorry, guys--fooled them."<br/><br/>"God made Adam, and Adam could not resist this temptation, because it is the nature of thinking things to want more knowledge. When they realize they cannot see everything in front of them, then they learn. And when they learn, they become like gods."<br/><br/>"See, that's where I'm different. I don't want to know anything about the universe."<br/><br/>"That is because you already know too much, my friend. There will come a time when you will have to talk to God. When that time comes, you will lose all your illusions, and be as simple as a child, but as knowledgeable as a god."<br/><br/>"I talk to God every day, and he gives me solace and comfort and later, salvation."<br/><br/>"You know what I like to read? Comic books. They are morality plays. All these detectives, and cowboys. The morality is so simple! I like them because morality is never so easy. But I think it would be nice if we could all be in the comics one day."<br/><br/>"Then you must be some kind of moron."<br/><br/>The man laughs. "I have been called many things, but never that! If anyone was to call me that, though, it would be you, Charleston."<br/><br/>"Who?"<br/><br/>"I understand, I understand. Do not worry, I will not shatter your illusions today, it is not what I came here for."<br/><br/>"You came here because you were arrested."<br/><br/>"Was I arrested?"<br/><br/>The Rev turns to the other prisoners. "This guy, did he come in with you?"<br/><br/>"Who are you pointing to, preacher?" says one.<br/><br/>"Then who have I been talking to all this time?"<br/><br/>"It confused us, but we thought you were preaching. Then you changed to a strange language we didn't recognize."<br/><br/>"I must have switched to Latin."<br/><br/>"I have heard Latin. I do not think it was Latin."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jack Seward comes around to visit Freddie. "Bit of a spot you're in," he says.<br/><br/>"I keep forgetting that our opponents have the resources of an empire behind them."<br/><br/>"So, there are two ways I could help you. One relies on deception, the other on whatever remaining influence I might have. Which would you prefer?"<br/><br/>"Direct, I suppose. I'd rather not get you in trouble."<br/><br/>"You know, she told me you'd say that."<br/><br/>"M?"<br/><br/>"Mina still owes me one or two things. She's very fond of you, old man. She just shows it in a very...Wilhelmina fashion. Now, take these pills as soon as I leave. And Freddie...it was a great pleasure and honor. And...I think Arthur would be proud of you."<br/><br/>At 9 pm Freddie takes the pills.<br/><br/>At midnight, he dies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy wakes up with a start. Interns are wheeling Freddie into the room. "Cardiac arrest!" shouts one. <br/><br/>A doctor gives Freddie CPR. "Come on, damn you, live!"<br/><br/>Jimmy watches as a Chinese attendant slips up behind the doctor, and inject him with something.<br/><br/>The doctor collapses.<br/><br/><br/>Down in the holding tanks, a guard walks along, raking his rattan cane against the bars. He quietly asks in Cantonese where the preacher is.<br/><br/>Charleston gets up and say his goodbyes to his cellmates. The guard takes him out into the corridor. "You're going to get one, right behind the neck," he says.<br/><br/>"Well, it will be quick."<br/><br/>"Shut up, crazybags," says Brady, uncuffing Charleston. "Come on, we gotta go pick up Freddie."<br/><br/>"Careful! You'll wake up the snakes."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The door to the infirmary bursts open. "I've been bitten by a snake!" shouts Brady in Cantonese. <br/><br/>The Rev's snakes hiss threateningly. The Chinese attendants scatter, except for two who bar the door behind the rest of them.<br/><br/>"Well, I'll say this for crazypants, he made a good distraction," says Brady. <br/><br/>At that moment Freddie sits up with a gasp.<br/><br/>"Up for a climb?" asks Brady.<br/><br/>"Down, I hope."<br/><br/>One of Brady's Chinese allies throws a rope out the window. Freddie, Jimmy, the Rev, and Brady slide down to the ground. Seward is waiting for them in a car.<br/><br/>Freddie glances around. "Where's Bertie?"<br/><br/>"Mr. Gilbert?" says Seward. "I'm sorry, Freddie, but we couldn't get there to protect him in time...I'm afraid he's dead."<br/><br/><i>[Don't dangle your Sources in front of a GM; I've telegraphed repeatedly that when PCs aren't around, then bad stuff is going to happen, since they weren't around to deal with the threat.]</i><br/><br/>At the waterfront, a grumpy Captain Hardekker meets them and they board his yacht.

Jack Brady finds Jimmy standing on the bow, watching the river flow past.<br/><br/>"Hey, sorry if I came on a little strong when we met. I've got to know you, you seem like a pretty okay gee. Even if you did help get the girl captured. This may not end up so well for me...so if anything ever happens to me, could you make sure Vanessa gets back to her family? You seem like a reliable sort to me."<br/><br/>"I get that a lot. Sure, I'll make sure she gets back. I'd rather you not die."<br/><br/>"Hasn't happened yet."<br/><br/>Jimmy notices that Brady is wearing a rather...unusual pendant. He stares.<br/><br/>"This? Oh, my mom gave this to me, for protection. It...helps me sometimes. When I'm in trouble."<br/><br/><br/><br/>As they approach the Calcutta waterfront that evening, they hear the boisterous singing of German drinking songs. On the wharves, sailors in German uniforms are battling the British shore patrol and otherwise carousing.<br/><br/>As they tie up, a British Customs official glances at Freddie's passport. "Russian? You don't speak German, do you?"<br/><br/>"A bit," groans Freddie. The Customs official points him to "those two Jerry officers over there."<br/><br/>Two stiff-backed German officers in overseas uniforms are indeed standing there. Freddie introduces himself. They bow.<br/><br/>"<i>K\xe4pitanleutnant</i> Karl D\xf6nitz," says one of the officers. "This is my counterpart, <i>Oberleutnant</i> Wilhelm Canaris."<br/><br/>"Charmed. I see you are doing a wonderful job watching your men fight the British. Highly entertaining."<br/><br/>"We are from the training cruiser <i>Emden</i>, making our maiden voyage," says Canaris. "Our crew...has gotten somewhat out of hand."<br/><br/>"The <i>Engl\xe4nder</i> want me to break up this commotion."<br/><br/>"Perhaps if we could guarantee the men some...entertainment..."<br/><br/>"Say no more." Freddie ambles over to the shore patrol commander. "I say, if you were to, oh, drop all charges and take the Jerries to your best local house of entertainment, I think we could end all this trouble. Here's some funds to compensate you."<br/><br/>Soon arrangements are made. Canaris gives a short speech to the men, dismisses them, and then gives Freddie his card. "Feel free to call upon me on the <i>Emden</i> at any time," he says. <br/><br/>Freddie walks away, shaking his head--he's gotten a very strong intelligence agent vibe from Canaris.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Monday, 14 December 1925</i><br/><br/>Freddie sets out into the bustling streets of the Bengali metropolis, hoping to dig up some clues on where Ho Fong Imports has relocated. He buys some porters tea and passes some pound notes among the less savory elements. From this he gathers that Ho Fong Imports have moved to Calcutta, they have some sort of a warehouse, but nobody has seen the boss our his daughter.<br/><br/><i>[Oral History and Streetwise use by FP.]</i><br/><br/>Taking a deep breath, Freddie plunges into the Indian Civil Service, hoping to find some paperwork that will locate his quarry. Fortunately, he chances upon Mr. Patel, a young, ambitious civil servant who is bored out of his mind. With his help, Freddie discovers that among other holdings, Ho Fong Imports owns some sort of decaying temple located in a "lost city" somewhere out in the mangrove swamps of the Sundarbans.<br/><br/><i>[Bureaucracy spend by FP.]</i><br/><br/>"Fortunately I'm surrounded by American heroes," says Freddie to himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy sets out to see if he can find someone who can help him find out more about the gate--specifically, is there anything at the center of the vast symbol sketched out around the Indian Ocean. With the help of Brady--who seems to have his finger on the mystic pulse of the area--they locate a sage/mystic/university professor.<br/><br/>Jimmy hands over the charts, and Noor's notebook (after asking Noor's permission.) The mystic--Rabindranath--waves at Noor, then starts consulting mathematics textbooks while chanting softly.<br/><br/>After several hours, he reports back to Jimmy. "First, let me show you on the map."<br/><br/>"Looks like a patch of blue, like all the other parts."<br/><br/>"Ah, but here, in the center, is a higher area, with many atolls. This place is centrally located...and the name seems somewhat appropriate. DANGER ISLAND!"<br/><br/><i>[I am not making it up, it's right there, smack dab in the middle of the Indian Ocean.]</i><br/><br/>"Is that a translation?"<br/><br/>"No, the British gave it that name. Now, the young woman standing over there in doorway was very intelligent. You know the Saamaaa Ritual? This picture--" he points out Noor's illustration of the broken slab of pinkish rock given to her and Charleston by Nyiti in Egypt--"is the key to the mystic 8th line. But there is one problem. The size of the gate will be considerable, perhaps several hundred feet. You must think carefully on who you wish to help you, for the ritual demands mystic energy--and blood."<br/><br/><i>[Cost is: 2 Stability or 4 Health, per "number of the line" (this case, 8) per 31 feet of enclosed area.<br/><br/>Me: I'm sorry, was saving the world supposed to be easy and free? They have a god on their side!]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis slowly comes to.<br/><br/>He doesn't remember much about the voyage over. He was drugged and beaten--of that he was sure. He thinks at one point he saw Dr. Mwimbe, beaten badly and chained to a wall. But he passed out soon after.<br/><br/>He is lying on mildewed marble floor.<br/><br/>The air is damp and hot.<br/><br/>There is music playing somewhere nearby.<br/><br/>The walls are a crumbling ruin, carved with symbols. Indian or Chinese? He's not sure. Probably Indian.<br/><br/>The music is coming from an arched doorway, the only exit from his room.<br/><br/>He has no idea how long he's been unconscious. He could be almost anywhere in the tropics.<br/><br/>The music is familiar.<br/><br/>It's the last song his wife recorded before he died. He had the only pressing of the record, back in his apartment in Montmartre.<br/><br/>He's wearing the same suit he was wearing in Singapore. It's been cleaned, he notices.<br/><br/>He reaches for his lighter. It's missing. So are his guns. His money is there, he notices with some irony.<br/><br/><i>...mais la vie s\xe9pare ceux qui s'aiment...</i> sings Isabelle on the record.<br/><br/>He walks through the archway, and down a corridor. The air temperature is getting cooler, almost temperate.<br/><br/><i>...tout doucement, sans faire de bruit...</i><br/><br/>In the dim light he can now make out a room at the end of the corridor. He can see a table inside. The table looks familiar.<br/><br/>Standing on it is his lighter.<br/><br/><i>...et la mer \xe9fface sur le sable...</i><br/><br/>He steps into the room. The table was familiar, he now realizes, because it's his. Not a replica, but the exact table he had in his apartment in Montmartre. He can see the stain from the first dinner Isabelle cooked him as his wife. In the dim light he now realizes that the room is an exact replica of his apartment in Montmartre. <br/><br/>There's a window where he'd expect it to be. Outside is...the street his building was on. Parisians move around on it. <br/><br/>Move...must be some kind of a motion picture.<br/><br/>The gramophone is playing in his bedroom, just through the doorway. He pockets his lighter and steps into the next room.<br/><br/>Sitting in a chair in the corner is Isabelle.<br/><br/>Francis faints.<br/><br/><i>...les pas des amants d\xe9sunis...</i><br/><br/><br/><i>[Shatter! goes the pillar: </i>Death is the end.<i> Fortunately, OP </i>actually had read the rules<i>, so he knew that he could reduce the Sanity loss by fainting. He still had to make a 7-point Stability test, so he lost 1 Sanity and a total of 9 Stability.<br/><br/>And his last pillar shattered. This means he wouldn't get any Stability back from his Drive, but that didn't come into play this session.]</i><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432937/#Comment_432937" name="Item_437" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-22T21:32:50+00:00" title="May 22, 2014  9:32PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's a number of the line?<br/>We're talking 16 Stability or 32 Health per 31 feet (square?) of the enclosed area?<br/>About Pillars -- can a player redefine one during the game (presuming, you know, it's still there)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432945/#Comment_432945" name="Item_438" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-23T05:38:07+00:00" title="May 23, 2014  5:38AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, right. Lines. So, the Saaamaaa Ritual consists of eight lines of poetry. Each line shields an area by making it impossible for a mystic creature of a certain health or less to cross the barrier. (I think it's 2 to the power of the number of the line.) The 8th line, which is not known, theoretically will shield an area completely, even through hyperspace.<br/><br/>The cost is: two Stability or Health, per number of the line, per 31 feet of shield. (I figured out why 31 feet! It's so you can easily do a circle, since the circumference of a circle is Pi * Diameter, and 31 ~ Pi * 10.)<br/><br/>So, a hundred foot circle would be 160 Stability or 320 Health, if you were using the 8th line.<br/><br/>You can definitely take a new Pillar via psychotherapy creating false Sanity. And in this session, we see an example of people getting a new pillar via getting Sanity back. Otherwise, I don't think there's anything in the rules, though I'd probably allow it provided there was narrative support--these are supposed to be really fundamental aspects of the character, so they shouldn't change lightly.<br/><br/>And hey, did you see that Simon dropped into the Pillars thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432964/#Comment_432964" name="Item_439" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-23T18:46:43+00:00" title="May 23, 2014  6:46PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, so he did -- thanks for the heads up!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432985/#Comment_432985" name="Item_440" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-24T20:27:50+00:00" title="May 24, 2014  8:27PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Here Comes Your Ghost, Again (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>James Warren Jones, DD, sets up a soapbox down on the wharves by the Hooghly. He begins his preaching. Not long later a large crowd gathers to listen to what they assume is some kind of Chinese mystic.<br/><br/>The snakes slither all around his body as he preaches.<br/><br/>"That's nothing," says a man to Jones. "I can do that with snakes. I can prove that my ability to control snakes is better than yours."<br/><br/>"I have no control over snakes. They are the emanations of the Devil; he craps them out and sends them among us. It is my faith that protects me from their foul venom."<br/><br/>"Then hold mine," says the snake charmer, who tosses his cobra at Jones.<br/><br/>Moving faster than the eye can see, the three snakes wrapped around Jones spring onto the snake charmer, biting him. He falls to the ground, convulsing.<br/><br/>The cobra curls up around Jones' leg.<br/><br/>"Do you see! Do you see what faith can do!"<br/><br/>"A miracle!" gasps the crowd. "A sorcerer!"<br/><br/>Several fall to their knees in front of Jones. Three men spring up and surround him. "Do not touch a hair on this sacred man's head!" They glare menacingly at the near-riotous crowd.<br/><br/>"Guru, what should we do?" says one.<br/><br/>"Who's <i>Guru</i>?"<br/><br/>"Why, you, Rishi. What shall we call you?"<br/><br/>"Reverend James Jones. People call me Jim, Jim Jones."<br/><br/>"A good name. Nobody with a name like that could ever do evil," mutters one.<br/><br/>"Teach us guru, we want to hear," say the men at his feet.<br/><br/>"I think he's Shiva," says one.<br/><br/>"No, totally Ram," says another.<br/><br/>"Tell us how we may rid our nation of the British!" says a third.<br/><br/>They begin explaining their woes. One's grandmother has millet blindness. Another has a deformed child. All are starving, part of the Bengal-wide near famine conditions endemic to the period.<br/><br/><i>[Me: It's Calcutta in the 1920s; their stories are legitimately terrible.]</i><br/><br/>"Let me speak to you in tongues," says Jones, and begins spouting gibberish.<br/><br/>Freddie, discreetly watching from a tea wallah's cart, notices that Jones isn't speaking gibberish--it's Aklo. "Blessings of the Dark Lord to you," he is saying. "I will offer you to him. Soon the time of his ascendency will be here."<br/><br/>No one notices that the cobra had been typically dark brown when the charmer threw it at Jones, but now has become jet black. Neither does anyone pay much attention to the fact that the snake charmer's body has vanished.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy catches them up on what he has learned. "So, we're going to need some people. A <i>lot</i> of people, and they have to be there. The island is the center of the eclipse, and should be where the gate will be created."<br/><br/>"How many people?"<br/><br/>Jimmy shrugs. "Depends on how big the generator is. How much blood is in a human being?"<br/><br/>Freddie ponders for a while, and then heads to the telegraph office.<br/><br/>He sends many telegrams that day.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Tuesday, 15 December 1925</i><br/><br/>Mr. Patel of the Civil Service happens to have a relative with a flatboat perfect for navigating the Sundarbans.

They let him know that he should probably lay low for a while, since the British have moles everywhere.<br/><br/><i>[Streetwise spend by FP to avoid getting arrested.]</i><br/><br/>The sun plunges splendidly into the Bay of Bengal as their yacht anchors off the Sundarbans. They board a few flat-bottomed boats and set off into the forbidding labyrinth of endless streams and mangrove islands.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis comes to again, this time on his bed.<br/><br/><i>His bed.</i><br/><br/>Isabelle is lying next to him.<br/><br/>"Is this really you?" he asks.<br/><br/>"You mean, am I the person who in life was your wife? Yes, it is me. We are not in Paris. You may already be aware of that."<br/><br/>"Are you all right?"<br/><br/>"Well, I'm undead."<br/><br/>"How can I help you rest again?"<br/><br/>"They used a spell to call me up, I suppose there's one to put me back down again."<br/><br/>"Is that what you want?"<br/><br/>"I...suppose it is not right that I am here. I...don't remember anything about being dead, except dying. But..."<br/><br/>Francis embraces her. She is neither cold nor warm. Her skin feels different, rougher somehow. But all the little details, the intimacies only he would recognize, are there.<br/><br/><i>It's her</i>, he thinks as he kisses her.<br/><br/>"We're going to get out of here," he says. "They used magic to do all this, right?"<br/><br/>"No, it is our furniture. They brought it from France."<br/><br/>"That's stupid. They don't know me that well, then." He knocks the kitchen table onto the ground and unscrews one leg. He takes out a strange screwdriver like tool. Ducking under his desk, he begins to fiddle with the drawer from below.<br/><br/>There is a snick, and a panel falls to the floor. He reaches up into a cramped, narrow space and pulls down a disassembled automatic with two magazines. He rights the table and quickly reassembles the gun.<br/><br/>"Stay behind me, and if you recognize anything, let me know--I'm hoping there's a way out nearby."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie, Jones, and Jimmy pole their way up a narrow creek. In the fog and darkness, the great bulk of a fabulous ruin lies in front of them. A few lights twinkle inside it, and they see patrols of men walking with torches around the perimeter of the building.<br/><br/>Short people. Quite short. Freddie stares intently--they resemble, impossibly enough, the Asian men who kidnapped him the day he won the auction for the Dagger of Thoth. <br/><br/>They circle around the building in the jungle. Jimmy keeps his eye open; it seems to be some kind of mosque. He points out a place where the wall has partially collapsed--if they can elude the patrols.<br/><br/><i>[Architecture and Archaeology use by JP. "And the guards say 'Praise be to Raaka-Tu!'" I said, but apparently nobody else played text games on their TRS III.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy raises his hand, halting them. He waits until the sentries round a corner and then they dash forward, half-dragging the Rev up the rubble pile.<br/><br/>Inside, they find themselves in a kind of covered pavillion. Jimmy looks at the elaborate wall carvings. The place was a mosque, for sure, and before that a Hindu temple...and then things get very weird, with half-erased carvings of a most sinister nature.<br/><br/>The cobra wraps itself around the Rev's neck, hissing in his ear. Jimmy hears, for a moment, Charleston's voice: "It's obviously an early Cthulhu cult, although here is a sigil of Nyarlathotep, and there's veneration to Azathoth in this section."<br/><br/>He stares at Charles--the Rev.<br/><br/>"Down, devil!" says the Rev. He shudders as they move forward.<br/><br/><i>[I asked for a Stability roll here; passing it meant that Charleston re-emerged for a moment.]</i><br/><br/>They pass through the room and enter a very pleasant outdoor garden. The stars shine brilliantly above. Fragrant scents from many night-blossoming flowers rise up to meet them, and they feel suddenly at ease.<br/><br/><i>[The garden was so nice that it gave a point of Stability to anyone in it, but nobody was down.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie, however, notices that many of the plants are in fact Chinese medicinal herbs--ones used often in poisons, as a matter of fact.<br/><br/><i>[Biology use by FP.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis leads Isabelle through the maze of corridors and ruined rooms. He enters large chamber with a high, vaulted ceiling. From a balcony above, he hears a familiar voice.<br/><br/>"Well, Mr. O'Donnell, I hope you enjoyed my surprise," says Robert Huston. "I prepared it specially for you, for interrupting my work in the desert."<br/><br/>Francis notices that Huston looks much older. The psychiatrist glances down. "My Lord did not enjoy having me call upon his aid. He took me to Sirius, all right--that's a twenty year round trip, if you only go as fast as light."<br/><br/>"Yeah. I'm going to take my wife here, and leave."<br/><br/>"Has she told you yet? What keeps her alive?"<br/><br/>Francis looks back at Isabelle, like Orpheus looking at Eurydice. "What's wrong?" he says.<br/><br/><i>[That was OP's actual description.]</i><br/><br/>Isabelle shrinks back, trying to draw herself into the shadows. "I have--to--consume...<i>sangre</i>."<br/><br/>Francis blinks. "It's okay. We'll get through this."<br/><br/>Isabelle begins to cry.<br/><br/>"Doctor, thank you for bringing my wife back."<br/><br/>"You are not welcome, you were supposed to be tortured."<br/><br/>"Hrm. I guess I feel really bad that you brought my long-lost wife back."<br/><br/><i>[Me: I think I know how you're going to punctuate this sentence...]</i><br/><br/>Francis fires his pistol at Huston, who smirks down with a gloating look on his face that changes to a look of shock as the bullet smashes into his shoulder, spinning him around. He turns and starts to run for an exit, but Francis drills him in the back.<br/><br/>Huston falls to the ground dead, a look of surprise plastered on his face.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern" title="hypomodern"><img alt="hypomodern" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern">hypomodern</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433050/#Comment_433050" name="Item_441" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T06:56:30+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  6:56AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> Oh, <i>Night's Black Agents</i> was another one of those happy coincidences between our two campaigns: I was already fully on board with pulping the adventure up via the NBA rules.

As they round a corner of the garden, they see two people sitting in chairs, with a small table holding a bottle of wine between them. One is a middle-aged Chinese man, wearing an elegant English suit.<br/><br/>The other is Ho Hsi-Tzu.<br/><br/>"Greetings, Mr. Blakely," she says. "Allow me to introduce my father, Ho Fong."<br/><br/>"What ho...Ho. You're a dragon, I suppose?"<br/><br/>"I? No, Mr. Blakely, a simple human being. I am myself--but I know that you think my daughter must have been possessed, to show such acumen at a young age. As a matter of fact, I raised her to be a intelligent and most capable woman--for few of us in the Cult are fortunate enough to have a relative chosen to be a vessel."<br/><br/>"Did you just say you were in a <i>cult</i>?" asks the Rev.<br/><br/>"Yes--I thought that was common knowledge. We are both men of the world, Charleston Chiu--the larger world. You more than of all of us."<br/><br/>"I am a man of <i>God</i>."<br/><br/>"As am I."<br/><br/>"Mr. Ho Fong, it's delightful to see you, and Miss Hsi-tzu, I hope you are happy being a vessel for whomever..."<br/><br/>"I think you know for who, Blakely."<br/><br/>Freddie suddenly realizes that Ho Hsi-tzu is carrying a sword. A sword he recognizes--the Sword of Akmallah.<br/><br/>"It's time to pay you back for Irem," says Hsi-tzu. "Then you defeated me because of your monkey and his machine gun."<br/><br/>"Jimmy, she's got the amazing sword of chop anything. Do something!"<br/><br/>"I don't want to shoot a teenager!"<br/><br/>"She's not a teenager! She's a 5,000 year old vampire!"<br/><br/>"OK, then." Jimmy fires the lightning gun at Hsi-tzu. She proves to be blindingly fast.<br/><br/>Ho Fong begins to chant. Freddie waits for the most dangerous moment of the ritual, and then shoots him. With an elephant gun.<br/><br/>Francis, from inside the building, hears the sizzle of electrical discharge. "My lightning gun!" he says. "And it missed! Jimmy!"<br/><br/>Tentacles lance out of the ground and drag Ho Fong beneath the earth. Freddie realizes, in a flash of insight, that he has sent Ho Fong to Chthuloid Hell--and there's a Cthulhu Hell! Ho Fong is dead, but the passage of his soul seems to have strengthened Ho Hsi-tzu...er, Shakhti.<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos spend by Freddie to 'hit him at the worst point in the spell.']</i><br/><br/>The Rev sees Francis coming up into the garden behind Ho Shakhti. He dashes forward, but she moves faster than thought, slashing for a decapitation strike. The Rev tries to slide beneath the blade, but he sees it flash forward into his eyes.<br/><br/>It's the last thing he ever sees. He is blinded.<br/><br/><i>[5 points of </i>rating<i> loss to Health and Athletics--the fully tuned up Sword of Akmallah is a devastating weapon. CP decided that the loss of Athletics was due to his being blinded.]</i><br/><br/>"If anything happens to me," says Francis to Isabelle, "go to Jimmy. He'll take care of you." He runs forward.<br/><br/>"Which one is Jimmy?" calls out Isabelle.<br/><br/>Francis launches himself at Ho Shakhti, catching her momentarily off guard. The Sword flashes out, slicing him across the chest, but he crashes into her, firing his pistol at point blank range. She deflects the shot with the Sword, but he pins her arms.<br/><br/><i>[Two rating points of Health and Athletics to Francis, but he got the shot off at point blank and then I let him spend some Scuffling to grapple her.]</i><br/><br/>"Jimmy! The lightning, now! Don't go weak on me!"<br/><br/>Jimmy takes aim and fires the lightning at the Sword. Sparks arc into the blade, bathing it in an eerie blue glow. Francis grits his teeth as he takes the feedback and is thrown backwards.<br/><br/>The Sword flies out of her hand.<br/><br/><i>[So: I used the NBA hit location rules, knocked off a point for conductivity, and ended with a HT of 6 for the sword. The gun is a +3 weapon, and Francis took the 3 points.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie steps forward and fires the elephant gun's other barrel into her chest.<br/><br/>As Ho Shakhti falls to the ground, Jimmy hears her last command: "<i>Feed</i>!"<br/><br/>Isabelle launches herself forward and latches on to Francis' neck. He shrugs. "Next time ask, baby."<br/><br/>"Sorry," she says as soon as Freddie and Jimmy drag her off of him.<br/><br/><i>[OP nailed the Stability check.]</i><br/><br/>"This is my wife," says Francis. He tries to pick up the sword.<br/><br/>"Pleased to meet you madam," says Freddie, bowing and sweeping up the sword before Francis can grab it. "Sorry old man, but the Sword tends to have a nasty effect on people. We should give it to some kind of Big Hero."<br/><br/>Everyone looks at Jimmy.<br/><br/>"On the other hand, I'm the only one who took fencing at Oxford," says Freddie, carefully cradling it.<br/><br/><i>[So, I had to remind them that 'the sword has two edges' was the warning they received; Pearkes began to go murder happy because he </i>used it on everything including innocent humans.<i> Someone who was more careful could use it with less ill effects. <br/><br/>And Jimmy didn't have any Weapons.]</i><br/><br/>The Rev gets up, groggily. "I can't see," he says.<br/><br/><i>I can sssseee for you.</i><br/><br/>"Which snake are you?"<br/><br/><i>Charlesssston. I'll tell you where to go.</i><br/><br/>"Well, I'll have to trust you to lead me the right way."<br/><br/><i>Alwayssss....</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>They find a room with clothes for an adult woman and a little girl, but neither Dr. Mwimbe nor Mirabelle. Painted on the wall is a simple message:<br/><br/>TOO LATE.<br/><br/>"Huston is dead," says Francis. "Seemed surprised that I could shoot him."<br/><br/>"Someone decided to play a trick on him, I guess."<br/><br/>Freddie goes out into the garden and starts digging graves. As he gets halfway down, he says quite conversationally to Isabelle, "So. Bram Stoker effect?"<br/><br/>"That was just...a <i>roman</i>."<br/><br/>"Not according to my aunt."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Rev gropes his way into the garden. Suddenly, he sees a flash of golden light. He seems to see a man, completely shadowed, standing spread-eagled in front of him.<br/><br/>"There is a demon among you," the man says. "Isabelle O'Donnell."<br/><br/>"My Lord and Savior!"<br/><br/>"I am."<br/><br/>"I will find her, my Lord!"<br/><br/>Jimmy is alarmed at the sound of hissing snakes. "Calm your snakes!"<br/><br/>"I don't have snakes! Have faith in God."<br/><br/>"Rev, if you're done ranting, could you maybe read the Last Rites?"<br/><br/>"I can't read anymore! But, I have the <i>jist</i> of it! Well," he says, drawing himself up above the corpses, "You didn't do very well in life, did you? But as you ride the elevator to Heaven or Hell, depending, think upon how you might have done better, and my Lord will judge you, either worthy for Heaven, or to be plunged in the fires of Hell. Oh, by the way, Freddie, I've been instructed by God himself to find a demon wife and kill her."<br/><br/>"Who is it?"<br/><br/>"What was that name...ah, Isabelle O'Donnell."<br/><br/>"Francis, your name is O'Donnell."<br/><br/>Jimmy jumps between the Rev and Francis. "It's a common name!"<br/><br/>"Listen, my dear," whispers Freddie, "I believe the rites of marriage don't survive death. So, you are no longer married to Francis, and thus entitled to use your maiden name again. I suggest you do so from now on, at least while the Rev is around."<br/><br/>They return to Calcutta, and make plans to head to the last location on the pentagram sketched over the Indian Ocena--Kerguelen Island.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern" title="hypomodern"><img alt="hypomodern" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern">hypomodern</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433109/#Comment_433109" name="Item_444" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T07:30:18+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  7:30AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> my sessions are more like 3 hours <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.

They check out every bar in Calcutta, asking for French wine, and when they can't find any, buying the cheapest drinks there. <br/><br/>They drink a lot of gin and tonics.<br/><br/>"Fran\xe7ois, let me be frank--she scares the hell out of me. Is she a vampire?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"You know, there was a time that would have been hard for me to take, but now? I'm glad she's <i>just</i> a vampire."<br/><br/>"She's coming with me. I'll take care of her needs."<br/><br/>"But she's trapped in a hell of a living death!"<br/><br/>"She doesn't want to die, or at least she can't ask me to kill her."<br/><br/>"I think this is a bad idea. You need to start thinking, and not with little <i>monsieur</i>. Now go ahead and hit me."<br/><br/>Francis decks him.<br/><br/>"That's it, get it out of your system!"<br/><br/>"Now, hit me."<br/><br/>"I can't hit you."<br/><br/>"Oh? I take care of my wife, like you're not taking care of your wife."<br/><br/>Guy punches him. Soon they are rolling about in the street, brawling.<br/><br/>Several hours later, they are in the back of a pub, singing Christmas carols together and boozily crying.<br/><br/>"That's the spirit, gents! Happy Christmas!" says the publican.<br/><br/><i>[This was OP's Solace refresh scene.]</i><br/><br/><br/>Freddie visits Wilhelm Canaris. "I don't suppose I could prevail upon you to visit this part of the Indian Ocean?"<br/><br/>"Mr. Blakely--uh, my dear Count <i>Orlok</i>--that appears to be British territory."<br/><br/>"Indeed."<br/><br/>"Are you asking me to strike a blow against the British in an area where they are extremely unlikely to know anything took place?"<br/><br/>"Unless someone blabs."<br/><br/>"Would, say, a medium cruiser be of any assistance?"<br/><br/>"My friend Francis would probably think this to be very useful."<br/><br/>"I'll make sure you have a code book and the call sign for the RMS <i>Emden</i>."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy visits Isabelle. "I'll be honest, I am very conflicted about you, and worried about Francis."<br/><br/>"I worry about my husband too. You are thinking, that it is better for me to be destroyed. I cannot maybe disagree with you, but it is not in my nature to wish for annihilation. James, it seems to me you are very wise. I understand Francis works for you now?"<br/><br/>"He's my partner."<br/><br/>"What can I say to you? That I do not wish for life anymore? Of course I want life! But so much is different now. It is not the same the life. So much is tasteless and dull. Except for Fran\xe7ois. Whom I love."<br/><br/>"If you ever feel that you are going to do something...wrong...let me know. And with a word, I will end it."<br/><br/><br/>Before they leave, Francis buys Isabelle a necklace made of tiny rubies for Christmas, since they cast off on Christmas Eve.<br/><br/><br/>Freddie has a dream. It's of Jax, which is normal--he's been having calming dreams of her for months. But this is different--rather than being set in Paris, it's in New York. <br/><br/>"Looks different. Probably because I have something to say. Well, Jax, the thing is, I'm breaking up with you."<br/><br/>"Typical. Easier, because I'm dead?"<br/><br/>"I suppose. It seems I've come to some sort of epiphany. I wish you the best afterlife. I'll try to finish your mission, save the world...but I'm not doing it for you anymore."<br/><br/>"Why are you doing it then?"<br/><br/>"Out of a sense of duty, I think. I guess Jimmy has been rubbing off on me."<br/><br/><i>[And with that, FP bought off his Symbol. And he didn't have a Solace!<br/><br/>FP: What do I need to get a Solace back?<br/><br/>Me: Use XP to raise your Stability.<br/><br/>FP: But I'm at max!<br/><br/>Me: Well, I guess you're all alone then.<br/><br/>(As it turns out, FP had forgotten that he lost 3 points of Stability when Gilbert died, so he could eventually use them.)<br/><br/>Freddie's new Symbol was Sheila's last letter to him from Paris--her "I'm leaving you" letter. Very Freddie.]</i><br/><br/><br/><i>Friday, 31 December 1925</i><br/><br/>Thanks the expert seamanship of Captain Hardekker and Mr. Motombo, the <i>Sterkte</i> manages to make decent time through the high seas, closing in on Kerguelen Island.<br/><br/>Kerguelen--the Desolation Islands! The last landmass of any size before Antarctica itself, once a whaling station, destined to become a French research station, but currently deserted.<br/><br/>At least officially.<br/><br/><del>Charleston</del> The Reverend Jones is standing in the bow of the ship, his snakes pointing their noses into the wind. Freezing spray lashes his face. Suddenly they all begin to hiss.<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/><i>Massstsss. Ssshipsss. Sssstraight ahead.</i><br/><br/>"Oh. Ships ahoy!" the Rev shouts.<br/><br/>"How does he know?" says Jimmy, in the cabin.<br/><br/>Hardekker brings the ship around. "We'll have to circle around and see if we can land somewhere else."<br/><br/>They finally put ashore on the other side of the island. As it turns out, there's a volcano on Kerguelen--Mount Ross. They set out for it. The landscape is blasted tundra, with trees bent over 90 degrees from the constant blast of wind.<br/><br/>As they round the flanks of the mountain, they see a large encampment of people on the seaward side. People from all around the world are gathered there.<br/><br/>Gathered there, putting on cultist robes and walking into a cave at the base of the mountain.<br/><br/>"We have a supply of those robes we've been lugging around," points out Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Won't we have to get rid of our armor?" says Francis.<br/><br/>"They're a cult," says the Rev. "There's going to be a lot of weirdos. Just put it on over the robes. It will be fine."<br/><br/>"How the hell are you walking around anyway?" demands Francis. "You're blind, right?"<br/><br/>"Completely! God is leading me!"<br/><br/>The snakes hiss.<br/><br/>"Oh, and wear the lightning gun openly. Only a high-level cultist would have those!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy arranges their disguises. Francis goes as the silent, fierce bodyguard type--gun, armor, and <i>face</i>. The Rev ties a rope around his waist and Freddie grabs one end. Freddie himself looks like a high-status cultist--he has the salt-and-pepper hair, hollow eyes, and general malarial complexion.<br/><br/>At the entrance of the cave, they are met by a man with a clipboard. "Australian...Australian...Egyptian...Chinese..."<br/><br/>"Repent!" says the Rev.<br/><br/>"Uh-huh."<br/><br/>Francis growls.<br/><br/>"Hey, calm down man. I'm just trying to figure out what section to put you guys in. And seriously, lighten up--if you can't be happy to be here for Ceremony and the birth of our god, well--I just don't know what kind of people you are."<br/><br/>"Can you check a name for me?" asks the Rev.<br/><br/>"Sure. Which name?"<br/><br/>"Isabelle O'Donnell!"<br/><br/>The man gives him a sharp glance. "Let me check...nope. Nobody of that name. Now, just go inside, straight up the ramp."<br/><br/>They head into the darkness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433205/#Comment_433205" name="Item_448" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T22:12:10+00:00" title="May 29, 2014 10:12PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jimmy is very sweet.<br/><br/>Bureaucratic cultists?

Ross they discover an enormous chamber, filled wall to wall with cultists.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Francis head off towards the Australian delegation. They find them gathered around some incredible technology--some kind of ray gun or projector; very close to the much smaller models they saw at Gavigan's party in Venice.<br/><br/>Freddie and the Rev head into the crowd, with Freddie edging them away from the middle; he has no desire to be in the center of the room. <br/><br/>"I think we fooled them!" says the Rev.<br/><br/>Right at that moment several large men with clubs surround Freddie. "Mr. Blakely? Would you mind coming with us?"<br/><br/>"It's because we asked about Isabelle, isn't it?" says Freddie. He discreetly drops the rope tied to the Rev, who sidles away.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Jimmy's disguise worked just fine; you'd have been home free, except for somebody tipping them off by asking about Isabelle.<br/><br/>CP (deadpan): Who was that?<br/><br/>Me: "Had Woody only gone to the police, none of this would ever have happened..."]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>"Aussie Aussie Aussie!"<br/><br/><i>"Oi oi oi!"</i><br/><br/>A large group of men with clubs ring the ray projector, which is also surrounded by a chain-link fence. "Hey, is that some of that what d'ye call it, ceremonial armor?" says one of the guards to Jimmy and Francis. "I'll bet I could still take yeh."<br/><br/>"Grrr," says Francis.<br/><br/>"Oi! Watch it! And secure that gun of yours, I thought we weren't allowed to keep 'em charged in here."<br/><br/>"Can you imagine? All the lives he's going to take for the Dark Lord?" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Well, we're all going to die eventually. Or, you know, in a couple of hours. And I can't <i>wait</i>!"<br/><br/>Jimmy nods nervously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie is led up several staircases and through narrow corridors cut out of the living rock...to a surprisingly modern Art Deco apartment, furnished mostly in white. A pair of glass doors lead out onto a balcony jutting above the huge crowd of cultists.<br/><br/>Freddie sits down as soon as the guards relieve him of the Sword of Akmallah. They place it on a tasteful end table and step into the corners.<br/><br/>Sitting across from him is Hypatia Masters.<br/><br/>"What ho, Hypatia?"<br/><br/>She looks at him quizzically. "Freddie...Blakely, right? I knew you from New York, right?"<br/><br/>"Ah, I see. I think we're on different timelines."<br/><br/>"Oh, have we met? I mean, <i>since</i>? No, no, don't tell me--spoilers. So I'm going to know you, eh?"<br/><br/>"Do you know Shakhti Bey?"<br/><br/>"You kidding me? I've been hating that guy since the Third Dynasty."<br/><br/>"They you'll be very happy in the future."<br/><br/>"I find I'm usually happy in the future. Things just keep getting better and better. So, you're here for the ceremony? You should have let me know back when we were in New York--of course, I was different then..."<br/><br/>"And I was a bit more of a wastrel."<br/><br/>"Yeah, you've got an air of something about you..."<br/><br/>"World-weariness?"<br/><br/>"No, more that I can see your brain extending out into five-dimensional space."<br/><br/>"Could you tell me a few things about Jack and Vanessa, and the rest?"<br/><br/>"Oh, you've met Vanessa? She was so said before. Much happier, except for the crazy. I mean, before she met Huston, she had just everyday crazy; the Dark Lord added that little <i>soup\xe7on</i> of 'I need you for my evil plan' and Huston stirred that up. Aubrey was a sweet guy, he's got the job of opening up the gate and sending Humanity on the great leap forward. Me, I just want to have a good time. Vanessa wanted to be Vanessa. Huston, well, he was nuts--totally on a power trip. Shakhti, well, we had to cut him in because of what he is..."<br/><br/>"Was he really Gilgamesh?"<br/><br/>"Certainly <i>acted</i> like he was. Dunno. Said stuff like he knew Adam."<br/><br/>"But M'Weru--now, I never met her. Will she be here?"<br/><br/>"Oh yeah. It's her show. See, she's the Dark Lord's favorite. See, some people are just ready to take the next step forward. Humbly, I'm one of those. But M'Weru...well, she made herself what she is, and the Dark Lord appreciates that."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Francis, I don't even know how that thing works," says Jimmy. "I mean--maybe that's the power source...we could pull the plug there, I guess, but there's a non-zero chance of us going into another dimension."<br/><br/>"Jimmy," says Francis. "Go find Dr. Mwimbe. Bust her out, and get her to the ship. I'll stay here and blast the conductor or whatever when or if they light that thing up. Take this flare gun. Fire it off if you succeed."<br/><br/>Jimmy scampers away, and then slows. He's a high-ranking cultist, right? So he should be using that.<br/><br/>He buttonholes an official-looking guard. "Take me to the high-level prisoner's block!"<br/><br/>"Yes sir!" gulps the guard. "What's your name?"<br/><br/>"My name...um...doesn't matter! Let's go!"<br/><br/><i>[Bad Luck, remember?]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Rev moves away from the crowd. He has no idea where he is going, but the snakes lead him confidently down into the lower vaults. They seem to be looking for something.<br/><br/>"Where are we going?"<br/><br/><i>Ssstorage.</i><br/><br/>"Why? What are you looking for?"<br/><br/><i>Sssomething you made.</i><br/><br/>"<i>I</i> made?"<br/><br/>"You!" says an imperious voice. "What are you doing there. Charleston! Come here!"<br/><br/>The snakes go quiet, leaving the Rev completely in the dark. He stands still.<br/><br/>The other person sighs. "Reverend, are you looking for something?" she says.<br/><br/>"Have we met? I'm the Reverend Jones." He bows in the wrong direction. "Who do I have the honor of addressing?"<br/><br/>"You may call me the Priestess."<br/><br/>"A fellow worshipper! Praise God."<br/><br/>"Praise. I think I know what you are looking for. It is in my apartment. Why don't you come with me?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I see. Well, I'm flattered, but when I took the collar I took an oath..."<br/><br/>"No, no, nothing like that. I will have some of my followers take you there. I have a small matter to attend to."<br/><br/>"Well, thank you! It was a pleasure meeting you, and I hope we meet again."<br/><br/>"I think we will," says M'Weru, "In one way or another--or one lifetime or another."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis keeps staring down the other guards. One of them nervously comes up to him. "I don't have you on the duty roster. What's your name?"<br/><br/>Francis grunts.<br/><br/>"Oh, do you not have a tongue? That should have been on the roster..."<br/><br/>Francis holds up four fingers, and grimaces.<br/><br/>"Oh...I...well, carry on then," says the guard. He sprints back to his friends.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy is taken up through old lava tunnels to the detention wing. His guide points to the last cell in the block, and he hurries to it. Inside he finds Dr. Mwimbe, chained to the wall. She is badly bruised and looks like she has been beaten.<br/><br/>"Is that you James?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Are you a cultist? Have you been lying to me all this time!"<br/><br/>"No!"<br/><br/>"Come, I've kept my head about me. Unchain me, and I think I can guide us out of here."<br/><br/>Jimmy easily frees her, and puts one of her arms over his shoulder. "Come on, Doctor." They exit the cell and begin moving through the tunnels.<br/><br/>"Thank you, James. It was terrible. They beat me and drugged me for days."<br/><br/>"I can imagine. We're here to get you and the little girl out. Do you know where she is?"<br/><br/>"No, but she is very important to them somehow."<br/><br/>"She seems to be mystically born--unknown father..."<br/><br/>"Ah. I had conjectured that as a possibility. Oh, this is so bad. Have I ever told you about when I was a little girl, when the Germans were putting down the rebellion? The Maji Maji uprising. This was...1905."<br/><br/>"No, Doctor. Which way?"<br/><br/>"Up. I was sent to be with my mother's people. She was Ameru, from near Mt. Kenya. It was strange. I was raised in convent schools. I was very European-proper, I had never been with my mainland relations."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry that you had to go through that..."<br/><br/>"It is all right. Of course, I couldn't use my real name--my father was an official in the German Colonial Service, so I might have been killed by rebels. My mother said, I should use the name, <i>Wameru</i>--it means, 'girl of the Ameru people.'"<br/><br/>"Now where?"<br/><br/>"Keep going up. But there was a very mean girl there, and she called me a different name--<i>Wamweru</i>; it means <i>light-skinned</i>, but I knew that she meant that I was the girl who was white on the inside. She wanted it to be a terrible insult. I never forgot; after that I knew that I had to learn about my people, become one of them, defend them."<br/><br/>They turn a corner. As they walk down it, two cultist guards fall silently in step behind them. Jimmy looks over his shoulder and starts as Dr. Mwimbe straightens up.<br/><br/>"So, when I joined the Cult, it only seemed natural that I take the insult as my name with them, so that I never forgot who I was and why I was fighting. But you know the English. Sir Aubrey could never pronounce it correctly. So he gave me a different name. M'weru."<br/><br/>Jimmy gulps.<br/><br/>"I believe that there ceremony is about to begin, James. Will you please come with me?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433261/#Comment_433261" name="Item_450" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-01T21:25:01+00:00" title="June  1, 2014  9:25PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

This was one of my more closely held secrets/plot developments/changes from the original. Let's talk a bit.<br/><br/>Way back when I was first developing the framework of what I would change in my reboot, I hit upon the idea of making M'Weru...more interesting, and less coincidental. That is, in the original she was given a massive infodump by Nyarlathotep that allows her to blend in with Western society. Now, there's a nice line in the original text about that--"she saw Western society, and judged it"--but there's something too pat about that, something not fitting the overarching ambition that seems baked into the character.<br/><br/>Then as well, she's parked for the entire campaign inside a mountain in Africa. This seemed somehow...wasteful to me.<br/><br/>So I went back to the drawing board with M'Weru, and quickly developed the idea of her as "The Doctor", in charge of the New York cult, but also a very active participant in the conspiracy's plans. After searching around on some naming sites, I hit upon the name Mwimbe as being reasonably authentic, plus standing out as a giant clue (as was her first name, Muriel.) And out of this, and through play, gradually developed the character of Muriel Khadijja Mwimbe, MD, Ph.D., all-around Renaissance woman and implacable enemy of colonialism.<br/><br/>Somewhere in there I realized that there was the very real possibility that I could make her attractive enough to the PCs that they would take her with them on their quest. This seemed too good an idea to pass up, and fortunately FP took the bait.<br/><br/>Now, if you go back to the Egypt entries, you may suss out that I thought the PCs would tag her fairly quick--they came <i>tantalizingly</i> close when Gilbert spied on her in Cairo; they had all the pieces then (she had contact with a guy wearing an upside down ankh, there was dried blood on the copper bowl she used to send bad dreams to MacDonald the elkhound), but for whatever reason they dropped it. (There was also the incident where she did not fully translate the Arabic autopsy report on Dr. Khafour, whom she had killed with a spell.) I had a backup plan for this--basically, she was going to use a spell to make whoever confronted her look just like her and set them loose in the desert. Fun to be had; I kinda hoped it would have been Pearkes, who could have gotten to see colonialism from the bottom up this time.)<br/><br/>When they didn't figure it out in Egypt, I decided to go for broke and see how long I could make it last. Along the way, of course, I made her a more and more ominous figure; she instigated the Freddie-Sheila split, her house in Zanzibar was a pretty formidable Mythos fortress (and she stole back the <i>Al-Azif</i>!), and by the time they got to Shanghai most of the PCs suspected something was up. FP obviously had hit upon the possibility that she was M'Weru. (She thoroughly scrambled Jack's brain to prevent a positive ID, although maybe I should have just conceded there.)<br/><br/>There were also hints that whatever her plans were, the rest of the conspiracy wasn't high on them; Huston called this out twice (in the decrypted message Jimmy found, and explicitly when he captured Francis.)<br/><br/>So what were her plans? I have to admit, at first even <i>I</i> didn't really know. Over time, I realized that what she was doing involved two prongs:<br/><br/>First, she was using the PCs as cat's paws to strike back at other members of the conspiracy; like Hypatia, she wanted agents for this job since the Dark Lord wouldn't be too happy about directly opposing his chosen players. (On the other hand, doing it all sneaky-like probably would amuse him.)<br/><br/>Second, she wanted the girl Mirabelle. Nobody in the cult would ever be able to get close to Jack Brady*; he'd proven that. But the PCs, they could do the trick, and at that moment she could sweep up the girl for her own purposes. Other members of the cult (especially Huston) didn't think having the girl around was particularly necessary to their plans, and so were less in favor of this idea.<br/><br/>By the time the PCs got to Shanghai, other members of the cult were striking back; the attack on Mwimbe in Freddie's hotel was genuine, which is why it shook her so much.<br/><br/>Of course, she should have realized that the PCs were Heroes and probably going to dumb-luck their way into foiling her plans; but then Muriel was always a bit too arrogant for her own good.<br/><br/>The other thing, though, is that she really was genuinely useful to the PCs; she needed them to further her goals, and didn't have a problem with them taking down some of her fellow cult members. (By the time they got to Australia she had basically decided that she only needed Jimmy--he'd be the most likely to succeed in getting through to Brady--but luckily for the PCs they stayed in one piece on their own. She did send the mind-blasting dream to Francis in Australia, though.)<br/><br/>*Brady has the Star Mirror, a magic amulet that summons a Star Vampire. It's from the Shanghai adventure in "Stunning Eldritch Tales". Using it is how he killed Dil Chandra's assassin, and kept the cult off of him. This ended up never coming out in play, because the PCs were worried about other things in the last two episodes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern" title="hypomodern"><img alt="hypomodern" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern">hypomodern</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433274/#Comment_433274" name="Item_452" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-02T08:43:01+00:00" title="June  2, 2014  8:43AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So good! I love the idea of M'Weru Yojimbo'ing the PCs for as long as possible\u2014thanks for sharing the backstory; also hooray Star Mirrors / Stunning Tales. I've secretly given the star mirror to the family of one of my PC's (he just so happens to be from Zhejiang, hooray).

In walks Jimmy.<br/><br/>"What ho, Jimmy. And let me guess--this must be M'Weru," says Freddie.<br/><br/>Hypatia looks at him with a strange expression. "Just how long have you known her for?"<br/><br/>"Almost a year. It's very, how shall I say, nefarious."<br/><br/>Hypatia stares. Her face twitches. She snorts, then barks out a stifled laugh, before breaking into a guffaw. "Oh my goodness. I need a drink. You want a drink?"<br/><br/>"We lack only Mr. O'Donnell," says Mwimbe. "Mr. Chiu is on his way. Now James, where is Francis? I think you know. If I were to say, cut your head off--" <br/><br/>She fingers the Sword of Akmallah menacingly.<br/><br/>"Careful," says Freddie. "The Sword cuts both ways."<br/><br/>"I am aware of how it works. I was present when it was forged."<br/><br/>At that moment the door opens again and the Reverend Jones is frogmarched into the room by two goons.<br/><br/>"Ah, Mr. Chiu."<br/><br/>"He only replies to Dr. Jones," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"What is this?" says Mwimbe. "He is blind. Who did this to him?"<br/><br/>The Rev starts, having finally placed the voice of the woman who spoke with him before.<br/><br/>"Ho Hsi-tzu, or whatever you want to call the being living in her. With the Sword."<br/><br/>"The best thing--the reasons you are not dead a thousand times over--is because you killed that monster...oh, I am sorry Patty. I did not mean to reveal anything."<br/><br/>"Ah, it's okay. Shakhti dies a lot."<br/><br/>"Find O'Donnell," says Mwimbe. "He must be in here somewhere."<br/><br/>"As a general rule," says Freddie, "he's wherever the most shooting and destruction are."<br/><br/>"There's going to be a lot of that soon," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You have no idea, James. But I must thank you all. You have done a great service, for without your help we would never have been able to find Mirabelle."<br/><br/>On cue, the girl is brought into the room, dressed in some bizarre getup that looks vaguely Egyptian.<br/><br/>"A sacrifice?" asks Freddie. "Or a vessel?"<br/><br/>"Oh no, no. Mirabelle is the next generation of humanity. She was fathered specifically for this great task. She...is the daughter of our Lord."<br/><br/>"Which lord is that?" asks the Rev. "Jesus?"<br/><br/>"The Dark Lord, Charleston."<br/><br/>"I'm going to have to check my translation."<br/><br/>"You know, I liked him better when he was just crazy."<br/><br/>The Rev sits down and pulls out his "bibble." He holds his arm up, and the cobra he calls Charleston starts to look at the book. It hisses in his ear, and licks his face, tracing out the letters.<br/><br/><i>[Me: I can't decide if I should call for a Stability check, or a bite your tongue to keep from laughing check.]</i><br/><br/>"Well, that's a new one even by me," muses Mwimbe. "I apologize for the deception, Freddie. I couldn't tell you, since we worked at cross purposes, although often our goals coincided. Shakhti, for example. And Huston was a dangerous man with bad ideas."<br/><br/>Freddie lowers his voice, so that Hypatia--who is at the bar--cannot hear him. "And what happened to her?"<br/><br/>"Why...Patty died. Inasmuch as she can die. I do not know what her plans were for this eventuality."<br/><br/>"So there are contingency plans?"<br/><br/>"Why, Mr. Blakely, there are always possibilities. Now, the conspiracy members each have their own plans. My plan is to destroy this infestation of the Europeans on Earth and restore the natural heirs of humanity--the true Africans--to their proper place."<br/><br/>"What about Mirabelle?"<br/><br/>"Ah, she is special. As I am special, and Patty is special. But Mirabelle...is very special."<br/><br/>"Does it help that I'm Russian now, and so technically Asian?"<br/><br/>"Not particularly. Do not worry, we will not kill you right away. In fact...we have so much to show you...that will probably take care of the problem for me."<br/><br/>She slides back the glass doors and steps out onto the balcony. "NYAR GASHANA! NYAR SHTHANT!"<br/><br/>"NYAR SHTHANT! NYAR GASHANA! NYAR SHTHANT! NYAR GASHANA!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Down in the crowd, an Australian elbows Francis. "M'Weru, ain't she a looker!"<br/><br/>"Grunt."<br/><br/>Francis takes this moment while everyone is staring up at the balcony to hop the fence and sneak towards the gigantic ray gun. He heads for a booth that looks like it controls the...weapon, or whatever it is.<br/><br/>He springs into the booth. Inside is a bearded man in a cult robe, fiddling with control panel in a very sabotagelike manner.<br/><br/>They stare at each other.<br/><br/>"Are you...a friend of Freddie Blakely?" asks the man cautiously, in a thick Eastern European accent.<br/><br/>"Yes...."<br/><br/>"I too am a friend."<br/><br/>"What was the name of his lost love?"<br/><br/>"Miss Elias, of course."<br/><br/>"All right. What are you up to?"<br/><br/>"Not everyone who works for the cult believes in what they do--"<br/><br/>Francis grabs him and shoves his silenced Luger in his face. "What?"<br/><br/>"We...do...business...for them...but...I...don't...want...the world...to end," the man manages to cough out.<br/><br/>Francis releases him.<br/><br/>"Do you want to disrupt the ceremony?" asks the man.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Come with me then.

Mirabelle walks out onto the balcony. The crowd bursts into an orgiastic spasm of violence and ecstasy. <br/><br/><i>[Me: The crowd goes nuts. And when I say nuts, I mean really nuts. You should probably make Stability checks.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie notices that Mwimbe is holding the Dagger of Thoth--the weapon that supposedly can kill a Mask of Nyarlathotep. <br/><br/>Jimmy notices something...happening in the vast volcanic chamber. What first looked like some kind of mist seems to be...solidifying in the chamber, into some kind of whirlwind like crowd. He tries not to think about how big this whirlwind is.<br/><br/>"He's coming," says Hypatia. "Ah...he's almost here..."<br/><br/>And then he is there. The Dark Lord. Nyarlathotep.<br/><br/>A vast, enormous being, standing on three huge legs...beyond elephantine, like the limbs of some horrid monstrosity from Earth's past. Huge clawed arms...at least three...branch out of the hideous, bulbous body. At the top of it is a great maw, full of jagged, sharp, spade shaped teeth. But above that is the most awful part--no eyes, no nose, no ears, just a tremendous lashing tapering limb, horribly twisting and flicking, spraying a viscous red slime everywhere. <br/><br/>The Bloody Tongue has come.<br/><br/>As they watch, astonished, at this awful appearance--<i>awful</i> in the true, oldest meaning of the word--the gigantic claws reach out blindly, stabbing into the swirling crowd of humanity gathered around it. The claws pull back, carrying broken bodies that it shoves into the champing, grinding maw. The chamber fills with the shrieks and cries of the cultists. <br/><br/>They are not cries of terror or pain, but longing, desire, and ecstatic pleasure. "Take us, O Lord!" they cry in a dozen, a hundred languages. "Destroy us and make us one!"<br/><br/>Jimmy stands and watches, astonished, stunned, his mind reeling. His hand, which had been stealthily reaching for his flare gun, dangles at his side bonelessly. <i>All a lie,</i> he thinks. <i>Everything I believed. Nothing has a purpose. Nothing! It's all random.</i><br/><br/>A tear forms at the corner of his eye. <i>All my life, I tried to not judge by appearances. But that...HIM...he's so clearly what he is...Evil. Monstrous. Beyond all understanding.</i><br/><br/><i>My life is a lie.</i><br/><br/>Freddie's mouth hangs open. Except for his phenomenal breeding, he would be drooling slackly. <i>Why did I care so much about what the Aunts thought mattered? What was the point of that? So many wasted years...so meaningless in a universe where THAT exists...</i><br/><br/>M'weru arcs her head back and laughs boisterously.<br/><br/><i>[So. This is a five-point Stability check to begin with: </i>You witness an obviously unnatural and threatening omen or magical effect.<i> But! Seeing Nyarlathotep in his non-human Mask bumps that up five whole points, making it a </i><b>10 point Stability test</b><i> that is of course a Mythos shock, so TN of 5.<br/><br/>But wait! There's more, and all of it bad. No matter what, you're going to lose at least four Stability pool just for seeing this guy, and any Sanity loss gets bumped up by 4 points. Worse, there's a </i>mininum<i> 3 point Sanity loss.<br/><br/>So, the players made the spend (4 points) to succeed at the check, which cost another 4 points for the minimum loss. Freddeie wasn't shaken, but both lost three points of Sanity. <br/><br/>JP spent 4, then took the extra four to go to -2. I actually screwed this up--he should have lost 5 points and gone nuts; instead I only charged him 4 (the 3-point minimum plus 1 point for being blasted on a Mythos shock) but what the heck, he could have spent the points differently and I may have screwed up the minimum loss rule (if you spend, does that count against the minimum?)<br/><br/>This was enough to smash Jimmy down to Sanity 1, crumbling his Pillars and leaving him without any. Freddie likewise had a Pillar crumble, which I've simulated in the interior monologue above.]</i><br/><br/>Slowly, without thought of concealing his action or trying to aim, Jimmy raises the flare gun and fires it at M'Weru.<br/><br/><br/>The bearded man leads Francis into a cavern made of ice. It is filled with leathery things that look like barrels...except they're not barrels...they're...oh God...are they <i>things</i>...<br/><br/>"What the hell are these things?"<br/><br/>"It is difficult to explain...these were the original owners of this complex. Aliens from a distant star. They inhabited Earth in the past, an Elder Race of beings. They probably will not take well to people summoning a dark god here."<br/><br/>"What do we need to do?"<br/><br/>"Warm them up. I was thinking of an oil fire."<br/><br/>"I have some of my special cocktails."<br/><br/>With the help of the "O'Donnell cocktails" they quickly start a fire.<br/><br/>"I don't know how you could have travelled with M'weru for so long without realizing who she was."<br/><br/>Francis shrugs. "I really didn't know who she was."<br/><br/>Several of the barrels suddenly sprout long, filigreed limbs...webbed like wings...and five sluglike limbs. They hop up. One approaches Francis and quick as lightning...grabs his lightning gun. It whistles for a few moments as it swiftly examines the weapon, then hands it back.<br/><br/>Francis whistles back. The "barrel" starts forward but is dragged back by its companions.<br/><br/>"Probably telling him you're not worth it in their language," says the bearded man wryly. "We should let our...friends do their work. You do not want to go out there."<br/><br/>"I know," says Francis. They follow the aliens until they approach the gigantic chamber, then turn aside.<br/><br/>Behind them they hear the cries of ecstasy turn into screams of surprise...and then pain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433310/#Comment_433310" name="Item_457" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-02T20:41:26+00:00" title="June  2, 2014  8:41PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Here Comes Your Ghost, Again (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>The flare erupts around M'Weru, outlining her in fire as the mystic shield she has woven around her absorbs most of the damage.

The world resolves itself into something much weirder but sensible to him.<br/><br/>He wraps a strip of cloth over his eyes and grabs several books. He takes the bowl, looks at it for a moment, then jams it, somehow, down the barrel of the gun. Being able to see in the seventh dimension helps him. He slings the Mask of Hyama over the side of his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Down in the chamber, Jimmy and Francis make rapid work of the demolition of the ray projector; by now their moves are almost synchronized. They make their way out through the corpses and pools of blood to the front exit of Mt. Ross.<br/><br/>They look out into the harbor, where the boats of the cultists are moored.<br/><br/>A pile of heavy weaponry lies just at hand. They look at each other.<br/><br/>Soon Francis and Jimmy are deploying a mortar and using it to sink as many ships as they can until they run out of ammo.<br/><br/>"You know, Jimmy," says Francis. "That was as bad as it could possibly get. But somehow we're still here."<br/><br/>"We...have a mission to finish."<br/><br/>"You have a mission to finish. My job is to make sure you do it. You have to do the ceremony."<br/><br/>"You're right. We've got to make it just a bit longer."<br/><br/><i>One way or another,</i> thinks Francis, <i>I've got to make sure Jimmy gets through this.</i><br/><br/><i>[So, Olympian, I looked down at the wreckage of the PCs.<br/><br/>And then I thought.<br/><br/>They'd destroyed every cult branch except for Penhew's bunch on Danger Island.<br/><br/>They'd survived a manifestation of Nyarlathotep himself.<br/><br/>If...ever I was to award Sanity to the PCs, this was the time.<br/><br/>So I gave out two Sanity points to everyone but the Rev, who hadn't lost anything...well, except for the four he lost when the snakes whispered the entire</i> Al-Azif<i> in his ear and gave him a quick four points of Cthulhu Mythos.<br/><br/>This gave both Francis and Jimmy back a Pillar; JP took "Close the Gate or Die Trying" and OP took "Jimmy will survive this."]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Down in the <i>Nautilus</i>, the bearded man shoves Freddie forward. "Go to salon. I will talk to Captain."<br/><br/>Freddie walks down a companionway. He enters a sumptuously appointed chamber. Bookcases and vitrines line the walls, and tastefully elegant furniture and carpets set the room off nicely. On one wall is an enormous window, shielded by an iris valve on the outside.<br/><br/>Standing next to the window is a woman in a white evening gown. She turns as he enters the room.<br/><br/>"Hello, Freddie," says Jackson Elias.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433316/#Comment_433316" name="Item_459" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-03T08:13:01+00:00" title="June  3, 2014  8:13AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2014 8:13AM by Aviatrix.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>[Post-Credits Scene!]</i><br/><br/>EXTERIOR, DAYLIGHT.

Lovely crumbling pillars. Lovely building them back up so you can shatter them again! Whee!<br/><br/>Where I stand, I've been doing a more traditional game. The group's smashed the NYC cult to piece. It broke the London cult -- sure, there are survivors, but both leaders had to flee. It wasn't until Egypt that their luck started to turn. Even there, they managed to prevent the resurrection of Nitocris and killing Shakti's current form -- and, in a form of poetic justice, Winfield was turned into a zombie and bound to watch over the temple of Bast. But, they did have to leave Egypt in a hurry.<br/><br/>Shanghai, well, I'm pondering where things are. They're planning to raid Ho Fong's place while he and Gavigan (who I swapped in for Stanford) go to the opera, which means I give the opera singer's player someone else to play, likely Brady. And I have a couple of odd decisions to make.<br/><br/>1. Is Brady's lover at the mansion? There's a lovely scenario in the companion that I'm pondering, but... it complicates things, and there's a certain lethality I'd need to weigh.<br/><br/>2. One of the characters is pregnant with the child of a Lesser Outer God, and she really is tempted to raise the child to be the Tsar of All Russia, as she was promised he'd be, someone who'd kick out the Communists. Should this be Nyarlathotep's child?<br/><br/>I'm thinking not. At the moment, of course, there are three children. There's Hypatia's child, and I'm considering going with "Hypatia gave birth back in Ancient Egypt, because why the heck not?" If so, she survived the birth, because bumping her off offstage is boring. This does park her and M'Weru at the mountain -- I don't to just redo your work, and anyway, it's late in the day to bring in a Mwimbe twist. I might be able to pull off slotting Hypatia into that roll, if she's returning to the mountain to visit her child, though I'd have to figure out what she'd been doing all this time.<br/><br/>There's Masha's child, the potential Future Tsar of All Russia. Then, there's Huston's child by Bosch, as I figured I could totally keep that from what you did. It's just that child isn't Hypatia. At this point, the kid's about 7 years old -- unless she went to Ancient Egypt, of course. And if I want to slot in a double agent (which I might not -- I already did this by having Tewfik using the bodywarping spell), that's the way to go.<br/><br/>Now, this kid is why Huston was blackmailed to join Roger. It's also why a newsreporter who tracked down what he could of Huston's records for the PC was murdered. So, there's something special about this kid, or some purpose it's meant to fulfill, even if that's just keeping Huston in line. I need to figure out what that is.<br/><br/>(And there's Ho Fong's daughter, of course, but I'm likely to keep her as is.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433379/#Comment_433379" name="Item_461" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T13:37:35+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  1:37PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, about Sanity rewards.

First, of course, is that the queer reading of Brady/Carlyle is so obvious to me that I really can't wrap my head around any other way to make it work :-) But second, there's a lot of Sax Rohmer funk clinging to the whole Shanghai chapter; Kenya does a much better job of exposing the racism underlying a lot of Pulp sensibility, while the Shanghai section...well, let's just say it doesn't confront those tropes very much.<br/><br/>You don't need my "Hypatia as the anti-Shakhti" thing to make Hypatia work, though. She could be any number of years older now, or barely recognizable (she left NYC in 1919, before the flapper craze hit, so she'd be hard to spot just on that alone.) It occurs to me that if you're going to look for a nurse/midwife/hey, been there sister character to talk to Masha, Hypatia's your girl for that. She could approach the PCs as a scout for Le N Grand. <br/><br/>Heck, she could approach openly; we don't know what Brady's reaction to Patty would be.<br/><br/>So them's some ideas.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern" title="hypomodern"><img alt="hypomodern" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern">hypomodern</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433393/#Comment_433393" name="Item_463" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T19:22:38+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  7:22PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Sanity awards are just supposed to be points rather than rating, but there's no reason why that <i>has</i> to be the case <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.

Mass combat makes it <i>worse</i>.<br/><br/>This is what I knew:<br/><br/>--The PCs were going to bring a lot of people with them to assault Penhew's island--both for muscle, and to have enough people to power the ritual.<br/><br/>--Likewise, Penhew has a lot of people on the island.<br/><br/>The first thing that hit me was that there was NO WAY I was going to run this using normal fighting rules. I might or might not break up the PC parts of the fight using regular combat rules, but for the struggle as a whole? No bloody way.<br/><br/>Fortunately I had some techniques for this.<br/><br/>I used to handle big fights in my Pathfinder game by doing some rough probabilities of success (hitting guys, basically) and using that to get some kind of cheap expected damage. Then from that I could make some simple charts with numbers reduced by some kind of common factor to make "boxes" that I could check off.<br/><br/>The second thing that I realized was that I should really, really use some * World techniques to make the fight. I even wrote *W style "moves" for calling in artillery or having someone take a bullet for you. They weren't very good, and we didn't use them.<br/><br/>But what I <i>could</i> do is to use "moves" for the opposition. That is, I could keep making soft moves to set up a situation, and then let the PCs figure something out.<br/><br/>And I wish I had realized that before! Sadly, I spent most of my prep working on the Fiasco playsets we didn't end up using.<br/><br/>Let me <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOTDhFX3dJdFlRM0E/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">show you what I'm talking about</a>.<br/><br/>So on the linked PDF, each box represents about 4 points of the ability. I abstracted all weapon skills into "Fighting"; Fighting boxes are closer to 2 pts/apiece, to represent the average NPC spend on a to hit roll.<br/><br/>Each box of fighting theoretically let you do 2 "harm"; after that, it would do half damage. (Because then you'd be making an attack without a spend, and the probability of hitting would go to 50%.) This was based on the idea that everyone would have +1 weapons (average damage: 4.5).<br/><br/>Yeah, that would have worked! It was basically what I did in Pathfinder. I made a parallel sheet for the opposition.<br/><br/>But as I ran the combat, I realized there was a much better way to do things; I could present a situation, and then attach a cost.<br/><br/>So, for example, toward the end of the fight OP wanted to capture some people. "Sure," I said. "It costs four Health or Fighting per prisoner."<br/><br/>That was a much, much cleaner solution &amp; I should have been using it from the get go; if I ever do anything as crazy as this again, that's the way I'll handle it.<br/><br/>I'll link the playsets at the end of the writeups, as part of the "appendices".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern" title="hypomodern"><img alt="hypomodern" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern">hypomodern</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433468/#Comment_433468" name="Item_467" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T17:29:22+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  5:29PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mass Combat is always a challenge on the table; I mostly end up winging it based on my wargames experience, with the exception of one occasion I had the players split up into two teams and *play* a light wargame I made up against each other.

The weather has been very chaotic since New Year's Eve, when some enormous storm burst out of the Antarctic Ocean and wreaked devastation in Africa, India, and Australia.<br/><br/>Jimmy stands near the bow, straining to make out anything in the murk.<br/><br/>Suddenly, there is a flash. It repeats in a regular pattern. Someone is signalling them.<br/><br/>Jimmy raises his own signalling beacon and flashes back a reply.<br/><br/>Captain Hardekker cuts the engines and the ship glides forward.<br/><br/>Suddenly, a huge shape bulks in front of them. It resolves into the trim and deadly lines of a warship. <br/><br/>From the deck of the German ship RMS <i>Emden</i>, Leutnant Wilhelm Canaris waves a greeting at Jimmy. Francis comes up on deck as the naval officer drops down to the <i>Sterkte</i>.<br/><br/>"Good to see you," he says. "You will wish to see your friends. They are trailing the <i>Emden</i>."<br/><br/>Hardekker guides the ship forward. Another ship slowly emerges from the mist.<br/><br/>Francis groans. It's the freighter <i>Ivory Wind</i>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon they have come aboard the ship. Thanks to good handling by its new crew, the ship is no longer decrepit, having been upgraded to merely miserable. Francis and Jimmy make their way down into the cargo bay.<br/><br/>They are greeted by something two pints short of a riot.<br/><br/>People mill about the large bay. Cots and even tents have been set up to quarter them. Jimmy points at several horses corralled over by some oil tanks.<br/><br/>There are two Bedouin--Sayid, Noor's brother, and Umr, her betrothed. "I knew she would never marry me," he says by way of introduction. "She had her ways, and I honor them. But it is fitting for me to avenge her, and her father, who was a father to me as well."<br/><br/>Several rather tweedy gentlemen prove to be Dr. Henry Armitage, Professor of Comparative Literature at Miskatonic University, and his colleagues Drs. Morgan and Rice. Francis shakes hands with Armitage, Jax's foster father.<br/><br/><i>[These are of course the three who tackle the Dunwich Horror. What, you that that was their first foray against darkness?]</i><br/><br/>Henry is impressed with Jimmy's plans, but worried about actually pulling off the spell. "It's a complicated thing to try and do," he says in his clipped Boston accent. "As far as I can tell, no one has ever done it."<br/><br/>Francis watches as Joyce Summers and Antoine de St. Euxp\xe9ry direct some cargo hands in how to lift their planes--two trim seaplanes--out of the hold. He nods approvingly at the twin Maxim guns each plane carries.<br/><br/>A man in the uniform of a British Colonel shakes hands with Jimmy. "George Pearkes," he says, almost apologetically. "Heard you chaps were in a jam. Glad to meet you, Jimmy."<br/><br/><i>[Nah, PP didn't make it, but I didn't see how Pearkes wouldn't have come to Freddie's call.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy is also pleased to see his friends Sam Mariga and Okomu from Africa. <br/><br/>Francis is surprised to meet Faith Mahoney, Mickey's daughter, whom he had last seen in Dublin. "Ye were always a favorite of me father," she says. "He always spoke highly of ye in his dispatches."<br/><br/>Francis nods, having guessed that Miss Mahoney might have taken up the family business. She's brought two of Mickey's "reporters", Stephen and Seamus.<br/><br/>Jimmy is overjoyed to discover that Katakatak has joined them, once he recognizes the body the Yithian is currently wearing. He's changed a few times since Australia.<br/><br/>"I have a line on the Renegade. Slovenia was a dead end, though," says the alien.<br/><br/>"I'm glad you're here. I'm going to need all the help I can get."<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"But you'll help?"<br/><br/>"For as long as I can. I have my own plans, you know. However, most of them are hampered by the opening of an interdimensional gate. Though it does help some others..."<br/><br/>Francis works out a plan with Canaris. The <i>Emden</i> and the <i>Ivory Wind</i> will steam south towards Danger Island, hoping to arrive a day before the eclipse. This will give them a little while to reconnoiter the area. None of them have any idea what might await them, or what the gate machinery will look like. They can only hope to find it quickly enough to perform the ceremony.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Earlier...</i> <br/><br/>"My God, Jax, is that really you?"<br/><br/>"You never change, do you Freddie?"<br/><br/>"I went to your funeral!"<br/><br/>"Oh yeah. Heard that was a big thing. Also heard you showed up drunk."<br/><br/>"What? Well, yes, but--"<br/><br/>"Sit down, Freddie."<br/><br/>He collapses bonelessly into a chair. "I've been trying to finish your work, Jax. Don't tell me that you've been in on it all this time--"<br/><br/>"Don't be ridiculous." She lights a cigarette in an elegant holder and sits down. "Glad to know you think so highly of me. Love of my life, ladies and gentlemen."<br/><br/>"Well, then, are you the captain?"<br/><br/>"No!" says a man entering the salon. He has white hair, a solid square face with bright blue eyes, and a pronounced Cockney accent. "You may call me Nemo, meaning <i>no one</i>, for I have no name--"<br/><br/>"Charlie," says Jax.<br/><br/>"Oh, all right." Captain Nemo sits down across from Freddie and Jax.<br/><br/><i>[Michael Caine as Nemo! Jeez, that guy really </i>is<i> in everything.]</i><br/><br/>"By the way, you owe me a fiver, Charlie. He reacted just the way I said," drawls Jax.<br/><br/>The captain looks at Jax, and then at Freddie. "Bloody hell," he mutters under his breath. "Allow me to introduce myself, sir. My name is Charles Marlowe, and I've been a sailor most of my life."<br/><br/><i>[Yes, THAT Marlowe, from the Conrad novels.]</i><br/><br/>"And how did you get this ship, Captain? My Auntie Em doesn't have anything to do with it, does she?"<br/><br/>"I haven't the fortune of her acquaintance, although she was friendly with one of my predecessors. No, sir, you see, several years ago I had the misfortune to make a rather trying voyage up the Congo river. The experience truly shook me, sir, body and soul, and after I returned to Europe I realized that I must become an enemy of a system so depraved. Well, one thing led to another, and eventually I attracted the interest of a rather powerful patron, who needed an experience seaman for his new submarine. And so I took command of the <i>Nautilus</i>."<br/><br/>"And quite the vessel she is. But what is your connection with these Cultists?"<br/><br/>"Ah, sir, there you get into some muddled waters. My patron is also their benefactor; he's especially friendly with Sir Aubrey. We've been making cruises on their behalf for a few years now. In return, Sir Aubrey has promised a fleet of vessels such as this. With those, sir," and a manic gleam comes into his eyes, "we could drive the imperialist nations from the sea. But as attractive as that proposition might be, I find myself somewhat opposed to his ends now."<br/><br/>"Because of the end of the world."<br/><br/>"Something like that, sir."<br/><br/>"And how did Miss Elias come here?"<br/><br/>"That was Muriel--Dr. Mwimbe's idea, not mine. After my men lifted Miss Elias from her hospital, she had us nab another woman who resembled Jackson. With the help of a little magic, we soon had a body that would pass an autopsy; after all, no one looks like themselves after floating in the water for a few days. We released the body right after leaving our dockage on Long Island and then left for other missions."<br/><br/>"Charlie's been looking after me ever since," says Jackson, lighting another cigarette.<br/><br/>Freddie studies her. He can tell that there's something missing from her--some vital spark.<br/><br/><i>[In game terms, all her Pillars are shattered and her Drive no longer functions. Plus, she's been cooped up in a submarine for a year.<br/><br/>I debated with myself long and hard about bringing back Jax. I didn't want to cheapen the palpable sense of loss that pervaded the early sessions by pulling the rug out. But I always saw this as a possible outcome, so I made sure to leave some wiggle room there. In the end, I decided to go ahead, but made sure it was the cliffhanger for the penultimate session.<br/><br/>And then FP went and changed Freddie's heart right before I did the big reveal. This is when games allow your story to move in unexpected ways.]</i><br/><br/>"And where are you taking me now?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"To Danger Island. Sir Aubrey wants to talk to you."<br/><br/>"To <i>me</i>?"<br/><br/>"Yes. Seems to have some respect for you. In any case, it's safest for us all to make him happy. He has ways of sinking even a ship like the <i>Nautilus</i>. But I do hope you and your friends can come up with something."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433481/#Comment_433481" name="Item_471" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T20:05:01+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  8:05PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVII: A Bunch Of Lonesome Heroes (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>Several days pass. Freddie is bored and amuses himself by chattering at everyone. Jax is languid and monosyllabic. Every now and again Freddie catches a haunted look in her eyes, but she always looks away quickly when she catches him watching.<br/><br/>Mirabelle charms the entire crew and is uncannily well-behaved.<br/><br/>Eventually they enter an undersea cave, the Danger Island dockage for the <i>Nautilus</i>. Freddie is led up through caverns filled with machinery. The skeletal frameworks for several submarines like the <i>Nautilus</i> are held in some. Workers scurry around them. Something about them strikes him as inhuman.<br/><br/>Eventually he emerges into the tropical sunlight. And blinks.<br/><br/>He seems to be in the courtyard of a Buddhist temple of some kind. Thick walls surround the compound, and two pagoda-roofed towers dominate opposite corners. A large building--where the shrine would be--seems to be some kind of residence or command center.<br/><br/>Outside the compound walls some enormous machine, swathed in gantries, looms against the sky.<br/><br/>As Freddie stands there, a thin, sharp-featured middle-aged man scrambles out of the house, across the porch, and runs towards him, hand held out. "Freddie Blakely how good it is to see you!" he says in cultured English accent, vigorously pumping Freddie's hands. "Welcome, welcome. Such a pleasure after all this time."<br/><br/>"Sir Aubrey Penhew, I presume?"<br/><br/>"Where are my manners? Yes, yes, call me Aubrey. Damned fine to see you. And this must be Mirabelle, coming up with Miss Elias?"<br/><br/>"Indeed."<br/><br/>"Excellent, excellent. How wonderful to have her as well. I do apologize for Muriel's deception. I never really thought her plan could work, but, well, no one could ever tell Muriel anything. Do come and take some tea."<br/><br/>Somewhat dazed, Freddie finds himself a short time later sitting on a verandah overlooking a large lagoon. A canal leads from a rather deep pool in the middle of the...temple...to the lagoon. A servant pours him a cup of excellent tea from a silver service.<br/><br/>"So, Freddie, I suppose you're wondering why you're here?"<br/><br/>"Constantly."<br/><br/>"Well, I have to admit, I've admired the way you've been tweaking the tail of the British lion. So many warehouses burnt! Was that your doing?"<br/><br/>"Mr. O'Donnell's. He has rather the knack."<br/><br/>"I thought so. Man of your breeding could never. And that breeding is part of why...well, let me do this in the right order. You know what we are going to do?"<br/><br/>"Open some kind of gate."<br/><br/>"Yes. But not just that. When we open the gate, it will be--to the source of all the cosmic mysteries. Our machines will modulate the energies that pour forth from that gate. They will awaken the latent abilities of certain humans in the area affected by the eclipse. Truly awaken them, Freddie. Their power will be...enormous. They will make the evolutionary leap to the next stage of development."<br/><br/>"You said <i>certain</i> humans. How many?"<br/><br/>"We think on the order of two percent."<br/><br/>"What will happen to the rest?"<br/><br/>"Many will be unaffected. Many, however will be killed by the changes. Many more will be driven mad."<br/><br/>"How many will die?"<br/><br/>"Some twenty or thirty million directly. Others, later, at the hands of the Awakened, or the madmen."<br/><br/>"Rather a lot, don't you think?"<br/><br/>"Well. We are doing our best to limit this, you know. This is the best chance we have to awaken a substantial amount of people, while still leaving the mass of humanity unaffected. We could have tried for the Antarctica eclipse earlier, but not enough would awaken, and it would have been logistically much harder."<br/><br/>"And what were the others' roles in this?"<br/><br/>"Dr. Huston did most of the programming, although it was a constant fight to keep his own megalomania from poisoning the project. Likewise Muriel and Edouard had their own ideas about what should go in."<br/><br/>"You make it all sound perfectly logical."<br/><br/>"Freddie," says Aubrey, with a pained look, "please try to understand. What if I were to tell you that within twenty years, over <i>fifty million</i> people will die? And not quickly, but in horror, by bomb, by fire, by famine. Eight millions--more--will be brutally sacrificed for no reason whatsoever except prejudice. I have seen this. Nyarlat-hotep has shown me the future."<br/><br/>"I doubt there will be another war."<br/><br/>"Open your eyes, Freddie. And besides. In...call it ninety years or so--none of the people alive today will still be living. By 2014, they'll all have passed off this world. And we may kill fifty million by what we do, as many as in the war to come. But...the survivors will be <i>gods</i>."<br/><br/>Aubrey lights a cigarette. "Anyway, Freddie, it's all the same to me really. I don't plan to be around when this happens. I'm going through the gate, and I'd like you to come with me."<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"You're a proven adventurer. I know you are a man of supreme breeding and talent. I could use someone like you with me, someone I know will do the right thing?"<br/><br/>"I...really couldn't. But I must thank you for coming right out and telling me everything, it's very refreshing."<br/><br/>"Well, think it over, think it over." Aubrey stands up. "I'm afraid I have to go see about the final preparations for the ceremony, and to greet your friends--oh yes, I know they are coming! You have the run of the place, Freddie; you won't be able to get into anywhere dangerous. And my head of security is rather brilliant, you know. Oh, speak of the Devil!"<br/><br/>Freddie turns as someone in a plain but very trim uniform approaches. An elegant shoulder pin seems to mark a high rank.<br/><br/>For the second time since Kerguelen Island, Freddie boggles.<br/><br/>"This is my head of security," says Sir Aubrey.<br/><br/>"Hello, Mr. Blakely," says Sheila Brisbane.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433486/#Comment_433486" name="Item_472" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T22:29:45+00:00" title="June  5, 2014 10:29PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

Muriel had been encouraging her to...think in certain directions (and she was a hell of a psychologist), and then Sheila met Hypatia...<br/><br/>Word of God is that Sheila was abducted by the Cult, but with the intention to turn her. And they accomplished it supremely well.\n<blockquote><br/>I'm still a little confused about the complex conspiracy. So, there's the open the gate plan. Aubrey and Huston are all for it. Jax and Nemo aren't, but are sort of playing along. So far, correct?<br/></blockquote>\nJax doesn't get a vote; she's alive because Nemo doesn't have the heart to kill her, and she's safe enough on the <i>Nautilus</i>. Plus, her Drive basically doesn't work (fairly certain it was invalidated, in addition to her Pillars crumbling--it was Adventure, of course) and she's not much of a threat.<br/><br/>Nemo does indeed oppose the Gate plan, but he's in a bind because open rebellion loses him the <i>Nautilus</i>. For now he's obeying orders, but as will be shown, the <i>Nautilus</i> is conspicuously absent in the final battle.\n<blockquote><br/>By the way, can Jax still not read or understand languages other than English? If so, why can she still understand English?<br/></blockquote>\nShe can still understand a little Hindi and Bengali; those didn't get touched, but she wasn't fluent in them.<br/><br/>She can understand English because...well, because she needs to be able to talk to the PCs. Consider the last entry in the journal as N pulling the rug out from under her feet, showing her that he had been running events all along.\n<blockquote><br/>Brady and Carlyle / Vanessa oppose the cultists, or, at any rate, Brady does. Vanessa's not really compos mentis. Mirabelle is Vanessa's daughter, and Nyarlathotep's the father?<br/></blockquote>\nYup. Brady was only in it because the love of his life was involved. Vanessa is fragile, but not incurably insane; this is why Jack wants her to go back to her family after this is all over.<br/><br/>Nyarlathotep is indeed the father. What that makes Mirabelle...is sequel bait, really. She doesn't play much of a role in the finale. Well, with one cool moment excepted.\n<blockquote><br/>Shakti's on board with Nyarlathotep's plan, but currently dead. Gavigan was trying to become a bigger fish, handicapped by the lack of magic power, but currently dead, so not a factor either, correct?<br/></blockquote>\nYeah. Fate of planet Earth isn't a big concern for Shakhti--he's an immortal spirit--but if the Boss wants the gate, then sure.\n<blockquote><br/>Masters went in a different direction, and may or may not have died in her past, basically in a sort of turf war with Gavigan, yes?<br/><br/>M'wimbe / Muriel had her own plans, but was all for opening the gate and destroying civilization, but is now dead, right?<br/></blockquote>\nMuriel/Mwimbe/M'weru and Hypatia were very close; both were "specials", humans capable of being upgraded. They shared a hatred of Shakhti. Mwimbe hated him because alone of all the other members of the conspiracy, she couldn't cow him based on personal power; her only leverage on him was her relationship with N. (Likewise, Shakhti didn't like her because of her status as the chosen of Nyarlathotep.)<br/><br/>Now, Mwimbe wasn't as powerful as Hypatia, who made some kind of deal with N to get near-Shakhti level power. (Her portfolio, near as I can tell, includes: time travel, telepathy, and the Yithian brain transfer ability.) She hated Shakhti...probably out of some kind of personal rivalry; the guy was a major jerk, after all, and she seems to have retained humanity, or at least the ability to care about humans.\n<blockquote><br/>And... Sir Aubrey is quite correct about what the future holds.

This is part of my theory that Nyarlathotep is...a shortcut, a way to get ahead before your species has quite made it.<br/><br/>As for Jax, it seemed okay; nobody complained.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern" title="hypomodern"><img alt="hypomodern" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern">hypomodern</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433515/#Comment_433515" name="Item_474" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T10:26:22+00:00" title="June  6, 2014 10:26AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sir Aubrey dusting off the ol' Darth Vader "join me and together we'll rule... whatever transdimensional realm is beyond this gate" approach, eh?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433517/#Comment_433517" name="Item_475" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T10:54:30+00:00" title="June  6, 2014 10:54AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, less "rule" and more "explore."<br/><br/>Sir Aubrey's understanding of what is beyond that gate may be somewhat flawed, but consider the source.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the Masks book gets his title wrong; based on his ancestry, Aubrey is clearly a baronet, not a viscount.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern" title="hypomodern"><img alt="hypomodern" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern">hypomodern</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433566/#Comment_433566" name="Item_476" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-08T15:54:10+00:00" title="June  8, 2014  3:54PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those curious, the bit that is wrong is the "Sir" bit.

"If you can't close the gate, I'm going through it."<br/><br/>"Are you nuts?"<br/><br/>"What choice do we have? I'll get to the other side and...deal with what's there. Who can we trust? To try and close it from the other side?"<br/><br/>"Brady," says Jimmy without hesitation. "You'll need somebody with some supernatural experience. How about Dr. Armitage?"<br/><br/>"I know that guy. Jax's foster father. Wish there was somebody who could handle fighting and the...other aspects."<br/><br/>"How about Dr. Jones?"<br/><br/>"The old guy?"<br/><br/>"No, his son. Henry Jones, Junior."<br/><br/>"I'll ask him about it," says Francis.<br/><br/>"We have another problem," says Jimmy. "The spell has to be kept up until morning. How are we going to keep a hold of the place long enough to do that?"<br/><br/>"That's why we need a backup plan."<br/><br/><br/><br/>On Danger Island, Sheila takes Freddie to her office. "Wear this badge," she says, tossing him a laminated piece of paper. "And stay out of trouble."<br/><br/>"Sheila, I can't believe you're here!"<br/><br/>"Why shouldn't I be here? They let me use my talents, unlike some people."<br/><br/>"But you were kidnapped! I was looking for you!"<br/><br/>"Looking really hard, I imagine. Typical Freddie level of effort."<br/><br/>"Now, dash it all, I was going to marry you. I still want to."<br/><br/>"That ship sailed a while ago, Freddie. Muriel showed me a vision of the future. What happens here has to be; there's no getting around it. Now, I'm pretty busy. Why don't you take a look around--my lieutenant will show you everything."<br/><br/>Freddie stands up as an elegant woman in a plain uniform enters. "Why, Eloise Vane," says Freddie. "I never thought to see you here. Either."<br/><br/><br/><br/>That night, Okomu and Sam Mariga come to Francis and Jimmy. "Mr. Okomu knows someone who can help you," says Sam. "Now it's time to meet him."<br/><br/>"What do we have to do?" asks Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Drink this tea."<br/><br/>Francis looks at him rather sharply, then shrugs. The tea is very bitter. He feels a bit drowsy, and then...<br/><br/>And then everyone vanishes, except for Jimmy. They are all alone on the <i>Ivory Wind</i>.<br/><br/>From the companionway comes the sound of footsteps. They catch glimpses of a man walking through the ship, although it is hard to follow him--he always seems somewhat further in the distance, as if they can't see him by looking directly at him.<br/><br/>Eventually they see him duck into a stateroom. Francis yanks open the hatch and they step out...<br/><br/>...onto a balcony, high in the air. The air is muggy and hot. The smell of tropical flowers fills the air. From their vantage point, they can see a large, pleasant looking bay. All around them soar towers, buildings seemingly made of glass. Distant traffic noises can be heard coming from the street.<br/><br/>A very handsome African man in a suit is waiting for them, leaning nonchalantly against the railing of the balcony. "Hello, Francis, James. My name is Bundari."<br/><br/><i>[I could not help but indulge my fantasies and cast Idris Elba as Old Bundari, mystic being.]</i><br/><br/>"Where is this place?" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Rangoon, but in a world where the Black Death was 99% lethal. Europe is a network of emirates. It's a fairly pleasant place for me to stay." Bundari picks up a cricket bat and begins lazily hitting balls into the bay. "The only drawback is that I'm the only person here who plays cricket. I apologize for waiting so long, but in almost all the timestreams before this moment, that witch you were traveling with killed me!"<br/><br/>"Well," says Francis, "we appreciate the trip here, but what can you do to help us?"<br/><br/>"One, I can let you know that: it is possible to do what you are attempting. Two, I have a present for you." He hands Francis a cage with a very ugly looking lizard inside. "This is Who-Is-Not-What-She-Seems. Maybe she can help you."<br/><br/>Francis looks dubiously at the lizard.<br/><br/>"Just make sure to feed her. She will be less useful to you if she is hungry."<br/><br/><i>[In the actual text, this is a chameleon that can become gigantic. I decided to ramp it up to 11 and have it be a young T-Rex. However, the PCs basically forgot about it during the assault, so this will be Who's last appearance.]</i><br/><br/>"We'll make sure to feed her," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Excellent. Just walk back and you will wake up. Oh, and Mr. Wright? The spell you are thinking of does not say, 'until morning'; it says 'until sunrise'. And surely the end of an eclipse is sunrise?"<br/><br/>Jimmy smiles broadly as they step through the door.

The trip is made harrowing, first by the breakneck speed the aviatrix flies at, and then the terrifying silence that occurs when she cuts the engine half a mile out from the island.<br/><br/>"Don't worry, I've done this plenty of times. You point the nose down and the airflow will start it right back up. Works almost every time."<br/><br/>"<i>Almost</i>?"<br/><br/>"Well, there was that one time...but I walked away from it, so good chance you will too."<br/><br/>As they glide over the island in the early morning light, Francis notices that it is far larger than is indicated on any chart. Mists shroud most of the shore, but he catches sight of a...pagoda? complex that looks like it must be Penhew's headquarters. He snaps some photographs for Jimmy to analyze later.<br/><br/>The engine turns back on with a thousand feet to spare.<br/><br/><br/>Dawn finds Freddie sitting on the seashore, waiting to meet Eloise, who has been his chaperone for most of the last several days. Finally he catches sight of her coming along the beach, holding Mirabelle's hand. He waves her over to the picnic blanket and tea service he has laid out.<br/><br/>"What was that?" says Eloise as she approaches.<br/><br/>"Sorry?"<br/><br/>"Thought I heard an engine...must have been the wind." She sends Mirabelle off to play with seashells near the surf.<br/><br/>"Surely. So, Eloise, tomorrow is the big day."<br/><br/>"Yes." She twists a strand of hair nervously. "I suppose your friends are out there, somewhere."<br/><br/>"Most probably. Francis is quite ruthless, and Jimmy very determined."<br/><br/>"I liked Jimmy. He was nice to me. And Francis...helped me see who I was. I didn't appreciate it at the time. I wish...I could apologize."<br/><br/>"I'm sure he understands. Of course, I'm not quite sure I do."<br/><br/>"Oh, it was back in France and...I'm afraid I don't like to talk about it."<br/><br/>"That's not quite what I meant. I mean...about all this."<br/><br/>"Oh. Well, you met Hypatia, didn't you?"<br/><br/>"Yes. A most frightening woman."<br/><br/>"I suppose...but, when I was really in trouble, Hypatia was the only one who understood me. She helped me through a very bad time. So it seemed natural that I would help her, you know? I mean, when I'm...not myself, I'm quite the effective fighter."<br/><br/>"And how does Sheila fit in?"<br/><br/>Eloise shrugs. "Hypatia trusted her, and then after Hypatia...went away, we trusted Sheila. And she's told us that this is what we have to do, to help Hypatia."<br/><br/>"It doesn't have to be that way, you know. You could go with my friends."<br/><br/>"Oh, Freddie." She hangs her head. "I really couldn't...I...have to help my comrades. But...I wish it didn't have to be this way."<br/><br/>She stands up quickly and runs towards the pagoda.<br/><br/>Freddie watches her, a crooked smile creeping across his face. "Come, Mirabelle," he says at last. "Let's go see Auntie Jax."<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the <i>Ivory Wind</i>, Francis and Jimmy begin to make plans. "Two teams," says Francis. "One to lead the main assault, the other to be our backup."<br/><br/>"What's the backup?" asks <del>the Rev</del> <del>Charleston</del> the Reverend Charleston.<br/><br/>"We're going to go through the gate."<br/><br/>"I think you're making a false assumption. Professor Schwarzchild has demonstrated the existence of a solution in general relativity of a singularity. Something physics can make no predictions about. In fact, he has shown the radius such an object would lurk behind."<br/><br/>"What are you getting at?"<br/><br/>"I think this gate may in fact be one of these 'black holes'. And it will only work one way. Things can go out...but not in."<br/><br/>"How the hell could you know this?" demands Dr. Armitage.<br/><br/>Jimmy shrugs. "You get used to it."<br/><br/>"If we only knew where Blakely was," muses Francis.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><i>[And from now on out, mostly, we're back on recording.]</i><br/><br/>On their way into the pagoda, Sheila intercepts Freddie and Mirabelle. "Go find Auntie," says Freddie to the little girl. "I'll be along shortly." He and Sheila sit down in her office.<br/><br/>"Freddie, I'm very busy and I don't need you meddling with Eloise. I'm very busy. You're trying to manipulate my people. That's what you do. It won't matter. What do you want?"<br/><br/>"The same thing I've wanted for several years now."<br/><br/>"You still want to marry me."<br/><br/>"As far as I'm concerned, nothing's changed."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery spend by FP.]</i><br/><br/>"You are aware that I'm planning to end the world tomorrow, right?"<br/><br/>"Well, Sir Aubrey wants me to come with him, you know. I think he's going to die along with everyone else."<br/><br/>"Pretty sure if Sir Aubrey thinks he can go through the portal, then he can do it."<br/><br/>"Which raises an interesting question: why are you going along with it?"<br/><br/>"I was shown by Hypatia that this is the way things have to be, so this is the way things are going to be. But it should be done <i>right</i>. And I'll try to kill as few people as possible."<br/><br/>"I spent an unfortunate amount of time with Hypatia, and she never had fewer than three things spinning at once."<br/><br/>"Yes. I admired her for that."<br/><br/>"So, logically, there is another plan? There are still some things to be done, yes? Some aspects that we don't know? For example, having a building dropped on her head didn't prevent me from seeing her on Desolation Island two weeks ago."<br/><br/>"I wish I had seen her there...and the ceremony. I don't know what you want me to tell you, Freddie. Your friends are probably going to try and stop us, and I am going to stop them."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"That's just the way it has to be."<br/><br/>"I'm fairly certain that Hypatia only said that Aubrey's plan was going to work."<br/><br/>"No, I just said it had to happen."<br/><br/>"You know, I appreciate that you're a fantastically competent manager. But maybe you're overlooking something Hypatia wanted you to do?"<br/><br/><i>[FP is trying to nudge Sheila towards what he thinks was Hypatia's plan--to screw over Penhew. Sadly, that wasn't Hypatia's plan.]</i><br/><br/>"Listen, Freddie, I don't know who you think you're talking to--"<br/><br/>"The love of my life."<br/><br/>"She's dead."<br/><br/>"No, I'm extremely delighted to see the version here now."<br/><br/>"Look, I have to go. I have to get ready to end the world tomorrow. And there's a lot of guns to check before Ceremony."<br/><br/>"Let me know if there's any way I can help."<br/><br/>Freddie strides out of Sheila's office and walks to the sitting room appointed to him. Jax is reading a dime store novel and chain smoking in the corner, while Mirabelle plays with a doll on the floor.<br/><br/>Freddie sits down next to her. "Mirabelle, dear?"<br/><br/>She looks at him with her slightly unnerving, intense gaze.<br/><br/>"When you dream, do you have a great deal of control over your dreams?"<br/><br/>She nods.<br/><br/>"Do you think you could dream about speaking to either Francis or Jimmy?"<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"It seems to me that this is the only way I have to communicate with them."<br/><br/>"What do you want me to tell them?"<br/><br/>"Well, it seems to me that you have a great deal more power in this situation, so why don't you tell them everything you think is necessary?"<br/><br/>"I don't have to dream to do that. Dreams are where I talk to Daddy. Why don't you just walk over to talk to them?"<br/><br/>Freddie rocks back, and pauses before saying quietly, "You can do that?"<br/><br/>"I can. Do you want to come?"<br/><br/>"Could we take Jackson?"<br/><br/>"I'm not sure. I've never tried to take people with me."<br/><br/>"Jax," says Freddie, "ready for a short trip?"<br/><br/>"I guess if I die here or die in another dimension it's all the same," says Jax, standing up. She grabs Mirabelle's hand, and Freddie grasps her other hand. They take a step forward--<br/><br/><i>Pain. Disorientation. The molecules! I can see them moving! The space oh the sound and--</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>"Yes, where is Freddie?" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>There's a bright flash of light, and Freddie, Mirabelle, and Jackson are suddenly standing in front of them.<br/><br/><i>[Eight point Stability test to watch Reality do things it wasn't supposed to...]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433768/#Comment_433768" name="Item_484" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-12T23:15:47+00:00" title="June 12, 2014 11:15PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            " It's so hard to translate the 3rd person genito-vocative preternatural pluperfect from Aklo ;-)" Ain't it the truth!<br/><br/>So, that 8-point Stability test -- what other Stability tests did they have to make?

I admit, I tend to call for more brutal Stability checks than I've seen in the published material, but then again my game had some resiliency built into it--the PCs could theoretically refresh up to 6 points of Stability per session using my Symbol and Solace rules.<br/><br/>That said, I'm wondering if in Gumshoe 2.0 it might make sense to dump the Stability <i>check</i> altogether and go with just fixed cost. In practice, this 8-point Mythos check to see the world melt in front of you only costs 4 points of Stability. The math of determining when to spend on a Stability check is slightly complicated* but not too difficult; but why even have that step? And also, it may be an easier sell to the PCs if you just say, "you were in a fight, knock off 1 Stability" rather than force them to make a check and spend points.<br/><br/>*Essentially:<br/><br/>--If the spend required to make the check is equal to or greater than the points at stake, don't spend. So, if it's a 3 point non-Mythos check, just roll.<br/><br/>--Other circumstances can be judged by looking at the expected loss (percentage chance of failure * the points at stake).<br/><br/>--Obviously, you need to modify this calculation based on your current Stability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433772/#Comment_433772" name="Item_486" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-13T06:45:17+00:00" title="June 13, 2014  6:45AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Building on that idea: you might call for a "Sanity save" when your Sanity is at risk--that would be a Stability check, and you could spend to make it.<br/><br/>As part of this reform, you'd have to lower the cost of some of the Stability tests, probably to the expected loss.

I could have done something then."<br/><br/>"Don't worry," says Jimmy. "You're still getting the hang of things here."<br/><br/>"I don't know how you live in these things.

One boat holds only rowers and three men--along with their horses. They approach the shoreline and halt in the mists. The sun rises slowly above them.<br/><br/>Near noontime the first bite is seen in the limb of the sun. The eclipse has begun.<br/><br/>The boats shoot forward and are soon being drawn up on shore. Gunfire erupts from the pagoda, several hundred yards from their landing site. Sniper fire from the two towers on opposite corners of the pagoda is especially frightening.<br/><br/>Group A makes a beeline for the front gate, keeping a tight formation despite the large number of people in it. A few shots hit home, staggering Guy and Inspector Melville.<br/><br/>Above them race the seaplanes of Joyce and Antoine. As they dive towards the pagoda, they are overtaken by two hideous winged serpents, easily outdistancing the biplanes.<br/><br/>"Not again," groans Joyce. As she begins to circle, two <i>different</i> hunting horrors rise up from the pagoda, and soon there is a snarling dogfight between the four of them.<br/><br/>Group B rushes the east wall, but sniper fire slams into the ground before half of them can reach the wall. The sky continues to darken.<br/><br/>"Come on, lads!" shouts Freddie. "One more rush, get back together."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by FP, after my "Separate them" move.]</i><br/><br/>In the back of the pagoda, Francis and Group C crash through the underbrush. "There!" points Francis. "That place is low enough to climb."<br/><br/>"It's under cover from the towers," says Brady. "They'll get a couple of us, for sure."<br/><br/>"Isabelle," says Francis in French, "I need you to go up into one of those towers."<br/><br/>"I am scared."<br/><br/>"Please...we need you."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by OP.]</i><br/><br/>Gulping, Isabelle sprints forward, faster than any human could run. She leaps halfway up the nearest tower and then scrambles up the wall like a lizard. She slips over the parapet. Soon there is the sound of a quickly cut off scream, followed by crunching and slurping.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seamus and Stephen plant satchel charges and blow open the gate. When the smoke clears, a crowd of froglike humans with claws from hands is marching towards them.<br/><br/>"Go!" shouts Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Charge!" shouts Pearkes. "Tally-ho!"<br/><br/>He, Sayid, and Umr gallop forward, saber and scimitars drawn. They ram into the crowd, slashing with their swords. Claws rend their legs and abdomen as they circle back and make a second charge. The Deep One hybrids are rapidly slain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Back on the <i>Emden</i>, the Reverend stares at the water, looking for Deep Ones. With his multidimensional vision, he can see a party of the amphibious humanoids making their way towards him. <br/><br/><i>[I had originally thought Group D would be making the landing, but it was pointed out to me that having the Shoggoth attack a medium cruiser would be more interesting.]</i><br/><br/>"What was it Francis said to use? Depth charges! I'll get the crew to help...but wait. They won't be able to see them in the water like I can," he muses.<br/><br/>He seeks out the Warrant Officer in charge of the depth charges. "You B\xe4ker?"<br/><br/>"Jawohl!"<br/><br/>"You know the general nature of the threat we're facing?"<br/><br/>"Froschmenschen, ja."<br/><br/><i>["Frogmen."]</i><br/><br/>"Come with me for a moment."<br/><br/>"Zum befehl."<br/><br/>They enter a ward room. Charleston unrolls a chart of the local waters. "You'll need to know where they are in order to be able to hit them."<br/><br/>"Ja, ja, ich versteh' ganz klar."<br/><br/>Charleston locks the door to the ward room. "I'm going to help you. I just need you to stay very still...and let this happen. You're going to be a great hero." He puts a hand on his shoulder. "This is a great responsibility, one that I can't entrust to anyone else." He leans in closer, until their noses almost touch.<br/><br/>The tentacles in Charleston's left eye socket burst through the cloth blindfold he wears, plunge into B\xe4ker's eye, and quickly deposit a larva in it.<br/><br/>B\xe4ker screams. Charleston clasps his human eye. "Do you see? See what I see? Power! Do you understand? This is your calling! It has been granted to you by God!"<br/><br/>"Du bist kein Mensch! Du bist ein Teufel! Gott hat dieses nicht gemacht!"<br/><br/>"But you are doing this for all of us! For...the Fatherland!"<br/><br/>"I am a loyal soldier of der Vaterland," rasps B\xe4ker.<br/><br/>"They will sing your name! The songs won't be very good because they'll be in German! But they'll sing your name!"<br/><br/>"Es gibt vielen ausgezeichneten deustschen Musiker," says B\xe4ker. "Beethoven war deutsch, Bach, Mozart..."<br/><br/>"Yes, yes," says Charleston, shoving him out the door. Soon the boom of depth charges can be heard.<br/><br/><i>[The German was all done spontaneously in session; I apologize if I mangled it.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>The sky above the pagoda is filled with angry, snarling serpents and seaplanes. As Group A pushes through the gate, a loud clang is heard from the strange structure outside the temple complex. The gantries fall back, revealing a streamlined, bullet shaped metallic...vehicle of some sort.<br/><br/>With a tremendous roar, flame spurts from beneath the craft, and it soars up into the air. The flash is so bright that the eclipse-created night briefly turns back to day. On the <i>Emden</i>, sailors stare. "Rakete!" say several.<br/><br/>From four points beyond the horizon, livid green beams lance up into the air, meeting at a point far above the island. As if in answer, an intense beam of horrid green light fires straight up, aimed at the occluded sun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434052/#Comment_434052" name="Item_492" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-19T00:36:20+00:00" title="June 19, 2014 12:36AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice.

They hit the wall despite being under fire from the other sniper. As he mounts the wall, Dr. Jones snarls--he's hit in the shoulder, but shrugs it off.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Freddie and Group C scale the east wall and land in a crowd of hybrid Deep Ones. Anton, Dr. Dodge and Ewa Cowles leap into the fray along with Freddie. After a confused melee, they manage to kill all of the hybrids, although Dodge and Ewa are much the worse for wear.<br/><br/>As Jimmy and Group A charge into the courtyard, Amazons open up from the side galleries with automatic fire, pinning them down. Suddenly there is a snarling shriek on their right--a huge half-wolf, half-woman has appeared and attacks Seamus and Stephen.<br/><br/>"My God!" they shout. "It's the Wolf of Lesser Edale!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis and Group C circle around to the south-east tower, looking for a way to ascend it and take out the sniper. Freddie, who had the same idea, runs into them just as three booms are heard from a rise behind the pagoda. They watch three rockets burn their way across the ocean.<br/><br/>"They're headed for the <i>Emden</i>!" says Francis.<br/><br/>On the ship, the crew watches in fascinated fear as the rockets approach. They cheer as the first one sails overhead and impacts the water a half a kilometer behind them. They cheer again as the second rocket's engine suddenly burns out and it crashes into the water a hundred meters short.<br/><br/>Then the rush to their damage control stations at the third rocket smashes into the bridge of the <i>Emden</i> and explodes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie charges up the tower stairs. As he rounds a bend, he sees Sheila standing there, blocking the way.<br/><br/>"Hello, Freddie," she says, and shoots at him.<br/><br/>Freddie ducks back, clutching the Sword of Akmallah. <br/><br/>"Do you really want to kill me?" he shouts.<br/><br/>"Yes!"<br/><br/>"Join the club, sister," mutters Jackson Elias in the crowd behind Freddie.<br/><br/>"Sheila!" shouts Freddie.<br/><br/>"Yes?"<br/><br/>"Is there any way I can convince you to marry me?"<br/><br/>Several shots ring out in answer.<br/><br/>"I'm just saying that you don't have to die on this island."<br/><br/>"I made my choice and you made yours. Now we see how this plays out."<br/><br/><i>[FP wanted at this point to use the Sword to cut "Hypatia's spell"--which I overruled because Sheila wasn't under a spell--and then "her resentment". Had this been, say, Dungeon World I would have loped around the room in happyjoy. But this is Cthulhu, and that ain't gonna fly.]</i><br/><br/>Freddie sighs, and steps around the corner. Sheila shoots at him, grazing his shoulder as the Sword seems to move into place to block the shot. <br/><br/>Fredde swings the sword, aiming at her gun, and cuts her hand off at the wrist.<br/><br/>As he bandages her bleeding stump, the rest of his team rush the sniper in the tower, quickly taking care of her.<br/><br/><br/>Down in the courtyard, Jimmy sees a stairway leading down below ground. "That's gotta be the place," he thinks. But the courtyard continues to be raked with automatic fire.<br/><br/>Faith looks at Jimmy, and then at the entrance. Her face grows hard. "Come on, you bastards! You don't live forever!" she shouts, and rushes forward. A shot rings out and she drops to the courtyard floor, dead.<br/><br/>"Come on!" shouts Seamus. He and Stephen lay down cover fire as the rest of Group A heads <i>en masse</i> to the entrance. Jimmy shoos them in. Desmond Motombo gasps as a bullet hits his heart.<br/><br/>"No!" shouts Hardekker as he turns to run back. Jimmy pushes him back towards the entrance. "There's no time--"<br/><br/>Suddenly he is shoved to the ground from behind. He rolls over in time to see his Australian friend Duggars shriek in pain, having taken the bullet meant for him.<br/><br/>"Finish...the job...me old mate," he whispers before dying.<br/><br/><i>[Charged 3 Health boxes for running across the courtyard; Duggars was a "move" I made--"who takes the bullet for you?"]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>On the <i>Emden</i>, the Rev races into the engine room to help as much as he can with the damage control. Suddenly he looks up--in the entrance of the room, he sees his nurse, Melissa, being held by a Deep One.<br/><br/>"What should I do?" he says to himself.<br/><br/>"Kill him," says Charleston.<br/><br/><i>[This was CP's idea--that we have a dialogue entirely between the two personalities sharing Charleston's mind. In this one, I played Charleston and CP played the Rev.]</i><br/><br/>"But I know how that gun works! It will kill her too!"<br/><br/>"Good. She's the one keeping me down."<br/><br/>"That's the best reason I can think of to <i>not</i> do it! Besides, she's an innocent!"<br/><br/>"Listen, crazy, you're just a cover personality for me. So pick up that gun, pull the trigger, and I'll show you who's in charge."<br/><br/>"If you were in charge, you'd do that already. Who's a cover personality now?"<br/><br/>Charleston reaches for the gun, but the Rev drags his hand back.<br/><br/>"You're not stronger than me. I'm the original," says Charleston.<br/><br/>"But I fight with God!" says the Rev.<br/><br/>"So do I."<br/><br/>"It seems to me that you've spread your loyalty a little thin on that front, Mr. Chiu."<br/><br/>"We're all good. I handled that."<br/><br/>"Says the man who can't control his motor functions!"<br/><br/>"You wanna see control? Let's see how long you last when I hold my breath."<br/><br/><i>[We decided that this would be a Stability contest between the two halves of his personality.]</i><br/><br/>The Rev/Charleston stops breathing. His face contorts horribly with the strain of the inner struggle.<br/><br/>Finally he takes a deep breath.<br/><br/>"God has triumphed!" says the Reverend James Jones.<br/><br/><i>[I spent "Charleston" negative, because hey, you can only go so crazy! But the -1 penalty caused me to fail the last roll.]</i><br/><br/>The Deep One stares at him, finding the spectacle disturbing.<br/><br/>"Halt!" yells the Rev, and raises one arm. Snakes leap off of it ans race towards the Deep One, who releases Melissa and runs out of the engine room.<br/><br/>Just at that point, the entire ship shakes. A booming sound comes from the keel, as if some gigantic creature were striking it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434099/#Comment_434099" name="Item_495" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-20T07:58:38+00:00" title="June 20, 2014  7:58AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love "who takes the bullet for you"!

In the center is a large black slab of surprisingly regular dimensions, bathed in an eerie green light.<br/><br/>"Ooooh," thrills Katakatak, "They have one of <i>those</i>."<br/><br/><i>[The dimensions of the slab are at a ratio of 1:4:9...]</i><br/><br/>Across from the entrance is a coffin-sized glass box. Inside the box is Jimmy's sister, Lucy.<br/><br/>Above the box is a little cage containing two huge rats. As Jimmy stares at the setup, he realizes that the glass box is designed so that the rats may be released into sectioned off parts of it...to devour whatever part of Lucy is located there.<br/><br/>From the shadows emerge Drs. Henry Clive and Johannes Sprech. "So sorry, Mr. Wright," says Clive. "But I think this is where it all comes to an end."<br/><br/>"You let go of that button right now!"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid I have absolutely no impetus to do so."<br/><br/>Sprech gives Jimmy a look as if to say, <i>Clive's gone a place I don't want to follow</i>.<br/><br/><i>[This an actual device from the <i>Masks</i> book.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy looks at the box, then at Sprech. He looks down again, at the slab, and the eerie green light.<br/><br/>He looks back up again. His eyes glint with the same light. Katakatak tries to grab him: "No...what you're thinking..."<br/><br/>Jimmy stares across the slab. He takes a step forward and <i>bridges the space in between with his mind</i>...<br/><br/>Suddenly he is standing next to Dr. Clive.<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos spend by JP; I charged 4 Stability because come on, that was </i>metal<i>.]</i><br/><br/>"Now...wait..." says Clive.<br/><br/>Jimmy shoots him.<br/><br/>Sprech drops to his knees. "This wasn't my idea! Please don't kill me, Jimmy!"<br/><br/>With a sigh, Jimmy pistol-whips him into unconsciousness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Back in the courtyard, Francis tells his men to try and round up as many of the Amazons as possible. "Bring 'em in, but don't kill them. We need them alive for the ceremony."<br/><br/>"On it," says Dr. Jones. He races down a corridor. There is the sound of a whip cracking several times, the bark of a Webley revolver, and the sound of punching.<br/><br/>A few moments later he returns with an Amazon over his shoulder. "Got one," he says, dropping her at Francis' feet.<br/><br/>"Wimp," says Jack Brady, dragging two unconscious women behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Up in the tower, Freddie hears a popping noise. Two small fireballs zoom up toward the tower. The fireballs careen around, setting several of his team on fire.<br/><br/>Freddie whips around and backhands one of the fireballs with the Sword of Akmallah. It explodes into a shower of sparks.<br/><br/>A fireball races towards the back of his head.<br/><br/>"No!" screams Billy, leaping in the air and wrapping the fire vampire with his coat. "Not...this...time!" He rolls around with his coat, being burned terribly as the flame finally sputters out.<br/><br/>"Sorry...Mr. Freddie..." he whispers before expiring.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the <i>Emden</i>, the Rev grabs the nurse. "My God...whatever your name is..."<br/><br/>"That doesn't matter now. Just go and find someplace safe, dear. Oh, do you know anything about depth charges, torpedoes, or sorcery?"<br/><br/>"No...but I think if you ask one of the officers, they'll know about at least two out of those three. Not always the same two, either."<br/><br/><i>[It is a German ship...with several future Nazis on board...]</i><br/><br/>The Rev crawls up the heeled over deck. The snakes crawl up his sleeves as he moves. "What is going on here?" he yells at D\xf6nitz, who is hanging from a rail.<br/><br/>"Something keeps hitting us from underwater!"<br/><br/>"Do you mean that big protoplasmic thing that is glowing and pulsing under the ship?"<br/><br/>"<i>What</i>?"<br/><br/>"Right. Um, the exploding barrel thingies, have they been working well?"<br/><br/>"We don't know where to put them! And if we set them off below the ship, we will sink!"<br/><br/>"We'll sink anyway at this rate."<br/><br/>"Good point."<br/><br/>The pounding suddenly stops. The Rev and the German exchange glances.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the <i>Ivory Wind</i>, which had been following them, sinks beneath the water faster than anyone could think is possible--as if the bottom had been torn out from it.<br/><br/>The Rev finds the Warrant Officer he...inflicted...with his hyperdimensional sight. "Try putting some torpedoes there!"<br/><br/>The Rev spins around. "I don't know what to do...Charleston, come back! You know this is ridiculous, there is no Rev and Charleston! You just tried to chop us in half and get rid of the parts you were ashamed and afraid of! Think how much we could accomplish together, hand in hand!"<br/><br/>And he has a vision. A vision of a steel door shutting in his face, and the dry voice of Charleston saying, "So long, Rev. I'm running the show now."<br/><br/><i>[And at this point, I started to play the Rev.]</i><br/><br/>"This is an outrage! You can't lock me up in your mind! I'm the real you! The you you wanted to be! Except for the snakes! What's up with that."<br/><br/>"And the blindness..."<br/><br/>"There was mission creep."<br/><br/>"Anyway." Charleston slicks back his hair. "Fire the torpedoes...thyear."<br/><br/>The main guns also begin to fire. Charleston grabs his ears in pain. "You think I need <i>these</i>?" he says, pointing at his ears. He pulls out his straight razor and slices one of them off, and stuffs a larva from his gun inside.<br/><br/>"That's better," he says, once his extradimensional hearing kicks in.<br/><br/>"I like the look," says a Voice.<br/><br/>"What, you? I'm <i>busy</i>" <br/><br/>"Yeah, yeah, I can see. You know what works great on those? Electricity."<br/><br/><i>[And so CP wondered if Jimmy or Francis had left a lightning gun. (Are you kidding?) Then he decided to see if a Preparedness roll would help.<br/><br/>Except Charleston doesn't have Preparedness.<br/><br/>But the Rev does...]</i><br/><br/>"Um...esteemed Reverend? I could use your help..."<br/><br/>"What...why does everything sound like it's under water?"<br/><br/>"Nevermind! We need a way to electrify the water."<br/><br/>"Ah, like when Jesus fought Typhon. We should use...the charging station Katakakatak built for the lightning guns."<br/><br/><i>[10 point Preparedness spend.]</i><br/><br/>Some horrible protoplasmic tentacles suddenly lance through the water and wrap around the deck, driving everyone except The Rev/Charleston incurably insane.<br/><br/>"All right, Charleston," says the Rev, "for the briefest moment in time we have to coordinate our actions." They're already running to the back of the bridge, where the charging station has been lashed down.<br/><br/>"Is this thing code?" asks Charleston, dubiously, staring at the sparking collection of tubes and glass.<br/><br/>"Germans built it, so yes."<br/><br/><i>[This was mostly CP, with me playing Charleston from time to time.]</i><br/><br/>"You should give those crew some pentathol to keep them calm," says Charleston.<br/><br/><i>[1 point Pharmacy spend.]</i><br/><br/>Down the stairs races the Rev.<br/><br/>"Look up in the sky," says a Voice.<br/><br/>"Wait, who are you? I'm the Reverend Jones."<br/><br/>"Oh for chrisssakes, keep yourself straight!"<br/><br/>"Did you say for <i>Christ's</i> sake?"<br/><br/>"I knew him once."<br/><br/>He reaches the charging station. Below him the Shoggoth churns and moils.<br/><br/>"Charleston!"<br/><br/>"All right, all right, I'm driving again." Using his martial arts, he kicks the charging station into the Shoggoth, which shrieks. He fires his submachine gun into it, filling the air with the hideous screech of a violin solo.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434303/#Comment_434303" name="Item_498" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T16:10:43+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  4:10PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVII: A Bunch Of Lonesome Heroes (Part 9)</b><br/><br/>Back on the island, Jimmy leads Lucy up to the courtyard. "Sit here, and don't look at anything," he says. She glances nervously around at the bodies strewing the ground.<br/><br/>When he gets back downstairs, Katakatak is waving his hands in the air and adjusting machinery. Okomu and Dr. Armitage are digging trenches around the machinery, and scribing strange symbols in the floor.<br/><br/>"All right," says Katakatak. "I've created a hypnotic psychic pattern here...anyone you bring in and begin to drain their blood, their minds will be drawn into the pattern, helping to feed the spell."<br/><br/>"Will it drain them all the way?" says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Not...most of the time."<br/><br/>Francis drags the Amazons down into the chamber and uses a scalpel to open up their veins. The trenches begin to feed with blood. The Amazons begin to murmur soft, sibilant syllables in no human language.<br/><br/>Jimmy, Okomu, and Dr. Armitage open their notes and begin to chant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie goes looking for Eloise. Unfortunately, he finds her.<br/><br/>A huge wolflike beast leaps on him as he strolls through the courtyard. She snarls, then groans.<br/><br/>Freddie rolls her unconscious body off of him. A hypodermic needle protrudes from her chest. The sound of wolfen snoring fill the air.<br/><br/>"Gents, a hand please," says Freddie with aplomb.<br/><br/><i>[Massive Preparedness spend to have a tranq.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Francis and Dr. Seward pull back people from the trenches as soon as they fear they are close to death, and push others forward to take their place. Three trenches are filled with blood, which is livid in the eerie light. <br/><br/>Jack Brady grabs Jimmy's arm as he is being maneuvered into position. "I'm not planning to wake up," he says. "Seen too much, stuff I can't live with. Take my medallion, though. Hope it brings you better luck. Don't forget about taking Vanessa home. And thanks. For letting me go out when it can matter."<br/><br/>Francis looks at the blood that has flowed out, and at the people they have left. He looks at Armitage, who shakes his head.<br/><br/>Francis starts unrolling his shirt sleeve.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Back on the <i>Emden</i>, the tentacles of the Shoggoth slither off the boat.<br/><br/>A Deep One comes running up. Charleston notices he is wearing a golden circlet on his head.<br/><br/>Charleston's eyes flash red. The Deep One stops. "Yes master."<br/><br/>"Send your creature away. Then leave me."<br/><br/>He turns around. There is a splashing noise behind him.<br/><br/>A man in a tuxedo is standing on the deck of the <i>Emden</i>, looking up in the sky, his skin glowing a horrid shade of green in the light from the sky.<br/><br/>"I really hate this moment. This is when it happens, that little rocket going up...and through," says the man.<br/><br/>Charleston looks up. The green light has formed a ring around the sun. As the moon slides forward into totality, there is a green flash...and the shadow of the moon vanishes, replaced by black space and stars in constellations never seen by humans before.<br/><br/>With his fifth-dimensional sight, Charleston sees more. Sees the swirling Chaos beyond the gate, the source, the place where all the answers lie.<br/><br/>"Have you figured out what I am yet?" says the man softly. "I'm the Shortcut. The Exploit. The Source Code...well, you wouldn't know what a source code hack is. I'm the Wiring Diagram. Whenever a species figures out that there's more to the universe than what their sensoria report, sooner or later they're going to invoke me. Hop onboard, and start using evolutionary seven-league boots. Just make sure your firewall is patched. I've been around forever, or probably since somebody did something stupid like shoot a rocket through a gate."<br/><br/>Charleston looks up. "I want to go there..." he says softly.<br/><br/>The Rev looks down. "I refuse."<br/><br/><i>[And here we began the Contest For Charleston's Soul! I play the Rev throughout this exchange.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Back on the Island, Francis lies bleeding into a trench carved in the floor, murmuring softly to himself. Freddie and his team make their way into the room. <br/><br/>Jimmy greets him. "I don't think it's working."<br/><br/>Freddie sighs. "Damnit, Jimmy," he says, taking off his shirt, "I thought you were supposed to be the big damn hero."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434304/#Comment_434304" name="Item_499" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T16:11:14+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  4:11PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2014 4:12PM by Aviatrix.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVII: A Bunch Of Lonesome Heroes (Part 10)</b><br/><br/><br/>"You cannot take the path of the Devil!" says the Rev. "Do not look up there."<br/><br/><i>[2-point Stability spend. We made a spot rule that Investigative spends would give 2 points to spend on the contest.]</i><br/><br/>"Don't you see, Rev? You and stupid Bibble? Think about the stories up there! It's the sum of all knowledge! For us, not that stupid old guy who keeps butting in."<br/><br/>"Hey," says N, "I'm not old. Or a guy."<br/><br/>"That the case, eh?" says the Rev. "Well...I'm holding <i>my</i> breath."<br/><br/><i>[3 point Stability spend.]</i><br/><br/>"I didn't need my eyes, I didn't need my ears, I can replace my lungs as well," hisses Charleston.<br/><br/><i>[2 point Intimidation spend.]</i><br/><br/>"All right," says the Rev. He picks up the Tommy gun and pulls the trigger. Shots carom off the deck, but none strike home.<br/><br/><i>[Charleston, unlike the Rev, has 8 points of Athletics, so HT 4, and the Rev has no Firearms, so he missed.]</i><br/><br/>"You insufferable, short-sighted, self-centered, sanctimonious..." Charleston swings a roundhouse kick at the Rev.<br/><br/><i>[FP: You're going to knock yourself out?<br/><br/>CP: I'm going to knock </i>him<i> out.]</i><br/><br/>N watches as Charleston spins around and cracks his head on the deck railing. He grabs a little flag. "Fricka frakka firecracker, sis boom ba! Charleston, Charleston, rah rah rah!" he cheers.<br/><br/><i>[Only one damage from the attack, which was applied to the Rev </i>and <i>Charleston.]</i><br/><br/>"This is all the reasons you are wrong in all the religions of the world!" shouts the Rev. He thinks furiously about all his theological training.<br/><br/>Nyarlathotep watches the flow of thoughts with amusement. "Wrong...never happened...wrong...I met that guy..."<br/><br/>Charleston staggers back. "And this is why everything you thought about those religions was never true to begin with!" He unleashes imagery from the <i>Al-Azif</i> on the brain of the Rev.<br/><br/><i>[Theology and Cthulhu Mythos spends, respectively. The CM spend staggered the Rev.]</i><br/><br/>"Art...there is goodness...in humanity..." the Rev concentrates on his favorite paintings.<br/><br/>"Come on, Chuckles, dig in. You can take this guy," says N.<br/><br/>"Would you stop interrupting!"<br/><br/>"Fine, I'll just sit here and stop time. Finish this so we can have ever so much fun together. I'll show you the answers."<br/><br/>Charleston looks at him suspiciously.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble spend.]</i><br/><br/>"This man is lying to you," says the Rev.<br/><br/><i>[Assess Honesty spend.]</i><br/><br/>"Howabout we just go up to it, and see what's there? Then we can come back and be as miserable as you want!"<br/><br/>"That's a good offer...but John 8:44 says, Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it."<br/><br/><i>[Bargain, then Theology. We decided the next roll would be opposed, for all the marbles, best total wins--I wanted to wind this up.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston starts to say something, and then shuts up.<br/><br/>"Every bone, every fiber, every hair on my head says this is a bad idea. For I <i>sense trouble</i>!" shouts the Rev.<br/><br/><i>[...and I spent 7 points and got a 13 total.]</i><br/><br/>Charleston sits down. "Perhaps it's time for a surgical solution. You know Rev, on some level I can respect you, but I just don't think we'll ever see eye to eye."<br/><br/>He opens the breach of his machine gun, and pops out a larva. He bites the casing off and pulls out one tentacle until it is very long and thin. Then he jams it up into his nose. The Reverend Jones makes a muffled shriek as the tentacle wriggles up his sinuses and punches through the blood-brain barrier with a crack.<br/><br/>Both of them shake with a seizure for a moment. Then the tentacle snakes back out, holding a piece of brain. Blood and ooze pour out of Charleston's nose. The larva latches onto the brain, forming a tiny symbiotic sentient being known as the Reverend Jim Jones.<br/><br/><i>["I have to walk this off for a second," I said.]</i><br/><br/>"You want to keep this physical body?" asks N. "It's a bit worse for wear."<br/><br/>"I'm attached to it. Besides, we can always replace it."<br/><br/>"You know, Chuckles, I never thought you'd come with me! But we're going to have a great time together."<br/><br/><br/>In the gate chamber, Noor suddenly appears in front of Jimmy. "Hello, James. I think this is the last time I will ever see you."<br/><br/>"Really?"<br/><br/>"Charleston is trying to go through the gate. You could prevent him if you want."<br/><br/>Jimmy pauses. "I really don't care," he says. He slashes his own wrist, and speaks the final Line of the Saaamaaa Ritual.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Big N, Big N, I'm ready!" says Charleston. "Take my hand and pull me through."<br/><br/>"What? Fine, let's do this the slow way."<br/><br/>Hand in hand, they ascend over the Indian Ocean, higher and higher. The air grows thin, but neither of them need to worry about that. Stars appear--the normal stars of Earth's sky, and the strange stars behind the portal.<br/><br/>As they near the threshold of the portal, Charleston says, "Big N! Big N! You should have <i>assessed honesty</i>!"<br/><br/>He pulls the Dagger of Thoth from his pocket and slashes it quickly across Nyarlathotep's throat.<br/><br/>Nyarlathotep, or the form it is wearing, stares in shock and surprise at Charleston as ichor begins to leak from its throat. For a second, there is a look in its eyes of--sorrow. Loss.<br/><br/>Loneliness.<br/><br/>Then it doubles up in pain, writhes, and twists into a new, hideous tentacled form that is sucked with enormous speed through the portal. There is a bright flash, and the portal snaps shut. For a second the voice of Jimmy Wright fills the attenuated air.<br/><br/>Laughing maniacally and shouting "I did it! I did it!", Charleston begins to fall back towards the Earth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434322/#Comment_434322" name="Item_500" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T22:45:13+00:00" title="June 24, 2014 10:45PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I doubt I can top that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p9" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu">1</a><span class="Ellipsis">\u2026</span><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p5">5</a><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p6">6</a><a class=" p-7" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p7">7</a><a class=" p-8" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p8">8</a><a class=" p-9" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p9" rel="prev">9</a><a class="Highlight p-10" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p10">10</a><a class=" p-11 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p11" rel="next">11</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p11" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18037%2Fx%2Fp10%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18037%2Fx%2Fp10%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep [Trail of Cthulhu] - Page 11 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p11" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="The Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep [Trail of Cthulhu] - Page 11" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18037/the-post-modern-masks-of-nyarlathotep-trail-of-cthulhu/p11" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I said CP won the campaign. :-D He had me going, and I think all the rest of the group.

Or am I flying? Floating?<br/><br/>The gravitational coefficient in the presence of an interdimensional gate of diameter N is...rho Z, I think.<br/><br/>Definitely falling.<br/><br/>I should learn how to fly. That would be a great idea! Noor, take a no--</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy speaks the last syllable. There is a ringing, snapping sound, and the horrible green light suddenly fades away.<br/><br/>He turns around. "Katakatak! I think I did--"<br/><br/>The alien's human body slumps forward, dead, the being animating him having fled. Jimmy looks around, at the dead or dying bodies of his friends and followers. Some are gibbering, minds damaged by the ritual.<br/><br/>With Dr. Seward's help he begins taking them up into the courtyard.<br/><br/><br/>The parts of the island not on the map begin to crumble into the sea almost immediately. Jimmy and Seward set up a triage center on the remaining beach, feeding the banked blood they took from the Germans before setting out into the bodies of those who survived the ritual. The ones they can't save, or who didn't survive, they start to bury in a long common grave.<br/><br/>The body of Jan Hardekker, who never woke up after the ceremony, falls next to that of Desmond Motombo. They lie side to side, their hands touching.<br/><br/>Jimmy starts dragging wood from the wreck of the Pagoda--most of it is washing into the Indian Ocean--to build a pyre for Jack Brady. As he stacks the wood, he sees something moving in the sky towards the island.<br/><br/>A large dirigible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Leutnant, es gibt hier ein Mann!"<br/><br/>The German crewman in the front of one of the <i>Emden</i>'s lifeboats points at a figure floating in the water.<br/><br/>The lieutenant stares into the now-dazzling water. "Der Amerikaner. Nimm ihn ins Boot."<br/><br/>The crewman drags Charleston's body into the lifeboat. "Er blutete aus ... \xfcberall," he says, staring at the blood leaking from countless wounds on his body. Charleston coughs up some salt water and groans faintly.<br/><br/>"Aber er lebt. Wir m\xfcssen ihn mit uns bringen, wenn wir unsere Zur\xfcckkehr nach Berlin machen."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The dirigible lands near the shore. An ageless-looking woman in a prim white dress steps out. <br/><br/>Freddie groans from his stretcher. "Hello, Auntie Em. Are we going home now?"<br/><br/>"Yes, presently. We have an appointment with the King, and a man who can help you." She turns to Francis, who is struggling into a standing position. "Mr. O'Donnell. I would offer you a position, but I fear my agency would not survive. You're very efficient at your work."<br/><br/>"This is my dear Auntie Em," says Freddie. "She's a very dangerous woman, and she helps run--what is it? The British Emp--"<br/><br/>"Museum," says M with finality. "The British Museum. I am a docent."<br/><br/>"Well. I have my wife back..."<br/><br/>"Yes--about that--" A stake suddenly appears in her hands.<br/><br/>"Auntie," says Freddie, "I'd appreciate if you'd leave Mrs. O'Donnell alone and not--"<br/><br/>"--Stake that foul beast in the heart?" She looks at Freddie, then Francis. "Let's call it a truce, Mr. O'Donnell. I'll leave your wife alone, and you won't interfere with me."<br/><br/>"I'm happy to retire."<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright."<br/><br/>"Just doing my job. Mostly," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I believe you have an appointment in New York with Miss Vanessa. Look to it, there's a good chap. A Royal Navy hospital ship will be along presently and take you to Singapore. Now, come along, Freddie."<br/><br/>"This man who can help," says Freddie as he limps towards the dirigible, "What is he? A barrister? Some lord?"<br/><br/>"No. A beekeeper."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Monday, 25 January 1926</i><br/><br/>M is as good as her word, and the survivors are ferried back to Singapore on a ship with a rather large number of psychiatrists on board. Even the toughest of the team is shaken--Dr. Jones, Jr., managed to look at one of the Hunting Horrors just as the sun's beams caught it after totality. The resulting explosion drove him into delirium.<br/><br/>"Snakes," is all anyone can get from him. "Why snakes?"<br/><br/>Seward only stays in Singapore long enough to resign from St. Howard's and St. Phillip's. "Time I was going back to England," he says. Dr. Watson has also finally retired and will make the trip with them to New York via the west coast of America.<br/><br/>Jimmy finds Vanessa in her room, her belongings already packed. "You're Mr. Wright, yes? Dr. Seward says that you're to take me home?"<br/><br/>"That's right, ma'am."<br/><br/>"And...Jack?"<br/><br/>Jimmy shakes his head slightly.<br/><br/>Vanessa nods, and dabs her eyes with a handkerchief. "I...had a feeling he wasn't coming back. But thank you. Thank you for helping him finally end all this."<br/><br/>The trip across the Pacific is restful for all of them. Francis is soon up and about, walking on the deck of the liner with Isabelle. Dr. Seward has brought his best graduate students with him, and they unobtrusively make sure to listen to all the survivors, providing what therapy they can.<br/><br/>They lay over in Los Angeles for a few days before continuing on to New York. Jimmy takes Vanessa and Mirabelle down to the beach at Santa Monica. He watches the sun set into the Pacific Ocean, feeling the cool breezes blow around him. At night he drives into Hollywood and looks at the bright lights from the marquees.<br/><br/><i>A man could get used to this,</i> he thinks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie is brought in front of King George. As he and M enter the audience room, an elderly man stands up from one of the chairs in the corner. Although old, his back is straight and his eyes glare with a fierce intelligence.<br/><br/>"Ah, you're all here," says the King. "I was just thanking our visitor for making the long journey up from Kent. And, if I might once again offer you, sir, the title you have so richly earned--"<br/><br/>The old man dismisses the King with an elegant wave of his hand. "My work has always been its own reward, your Majesty. I lack no means of support, and the knighthood you saw fit to bestow upon my dear old friend was reward enough. Shall we begin on the matter at hand?"<br/><br/>The King sighs and leans back in his chair. "If we must, although I can't see how even you, my friend, can get young...Roland out of this."<br/><br/>"It is an axiom of mine," says the old man, "that once you have eliminated the impossible, what remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth."<br/><br/>Freddie boggles. "My God," he says. "Are you real?"<br/><br/>The man dismisses him with the same elegant gesture. "Clearly, based on the testimony and records presented by Sir John Seward, MD, there can be no doubt that this man is indeed the son of the late Arthur, Earl Godalming. And clearly, Roland Blakely was a terrorist. But you, sir, <i>do not resemble this Blakely in the slightest</i>."<br/><br/>Freddie looks in the mirror. He is fitter than he has ever been; he couldn't fit into his old dinner jacket. His hair has been graying ever since the encounter with Shakhti under the Sphinx, and his skin is taut and malarial. His eyes, too, have a haunted look about him. <i>Damned if </i>I<i> don't recognize me,</i> he thinks.<br/><br/>"I therefore think that the easiest thing is to quietly confirm Mr. Lockwood as Fifth Earl and let him live--"<br/><br/>"Anywhere but England," interjects the King. "I'm afraid I'm going to stipulate that. Just stay out of England!"<br/><br/>"But Uncle George!"<br/><br/>"I'm sorry. Maybe when my worthless son becomes King--"<br/><br/>"But Teddy's wonderful!"<br/><br/>"David. And he doesn't like you."<br/><br/>"Hrm, must be about that car..."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434438/#Comment_434438" name="Item_505" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T16:02:01+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  4:02PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVII: A Bunch Of Lonesome Heroes (Part 12)</b><br/><br/><i>Tuesday, 9 February 1926</i><br/><br/>Jimmy, Francis, and Vanessa make the long drive out to Long Island to the Carlisle Mansion. The butler takes them into a sitting room where they wait a long time for Erica Carlisle.<br/><br/>When she finally does appear, she points harshly at Vanessa. "Who is that?"<br/><br/>Jimmy sighs. "It's a long story. I would like you to meet--"<br/><br/>"Vanessa?" Erica takes a step forward. Vanessa stands up. For a moment they stare at each other, tensely.<br/><br/>Then Erica wraps her arms around her sister. They both begin to cry.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Francis quietly leave the sitting room and close the doors behind them. Bradley Grey comes down the hallway towards them, making his way on crutches.<br/><br/>"Hello, Jimmy."<br/><br/>"I heard about the shooting."<br/><br/>"You know, it's weird, but a couple of weeks ago my legs suddenly started to get better."<br/><br/>"You don't say?"<br/><br/>"Hey, Jimmy, you want a job in the DA's office?"<br/><br/>"Thanks, but no. I've got my own little thing, and I have a partner now."<br/><br/>"I'm semi-retired," says Francis. "As long as I keep out of the British Empire, I should be fine. And I think my wife would like America. Probably settle in New Orleans."<br/><br/>"I think I'm going to go to Los Angeles," says Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Well, think about it," says Bradley. "And if you ever need help, I know a guy in the DA's department out there who probably will need a job. Good guy, but a little insubordinate. Name's Marlowe, Pete or Phil or something like that."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie drops by the hospital right before he leaves London to check on Eloise and Sheila. Neither are in a particularly good mood--they have lost the will to live, since the failure of the Gate.<br/><br/>"Listen, I think you two might want to work for my Aunt. She has just the sort of organization that could use people like you."<br/><br/>"I suppose I owe a debt of honor to you and Francis," muses Eloise.<br/><br/>"What about you, Sheila?"<br/><br/>"I think...I'm going to go work for your Aunt?"<br/><br/>"She definitely needs some one as talented as you. Sorry about the hand."<br/><br/>"It's all right...I understand you're not coming back to England. That's probably a good idea. If I see you, I'm just going to start shooting and figure it's self-defense."<br/><br/>"Well, that's the most original rejection of a proposal I've ever had," huffs Freddie.<br/><br/><br/><i>Tuesday, 16 February 1926</i><br/><br/>And exactly one year after Jax returned to New York, Freddie Blakely drags himself up two flights of stairs to the offices of the <i>Golden Sentinel</i>. He pushes on the door, but it is locked. Cursing, he tries to fit a key into the door, but it doesn't fit.<br/><br/>He looks up. The sign on the door has changed. Now it reads:<br/><br/>THE RED SENTINEL<br/>A Journal of the Worker's Party<br/><br/>The door flies open and he finds himself staring at Marion Goodhue. "Oh, Freddie! Hi! I bought the paper from your aunt. She says she's going to stick to the ladies' magazines."<br/><br/>"You must have me mistaken for someone else," he says. "Freddie Blakely is a horrible terrorist."<br/><br/>"Well, I don't believe in nobility. Anyway, your friend Jackson said that she wants to meet you in front of the Hotel New Yorker. I think your friends are down there already."<br/><br/>"Really?"<br/><br/>"Yeah, something about where it all started."<br/><br/>"I see. Well, good luck."<br/><br/>"Great!  By 1950, we'll be burying the West!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Freddie finds Jimmy, Francis, and Jax standing in front of the Hotel. Jax is standing very straight. "I have one more thing to do," she says in an odd tone of voice.<br/><br/>They ride up the elevator. Freddie notices that she doesn't even flinch as they pass the seventeenth floor. They ride a few floors higher, get off, and walk down the hall to a room. Jax knocks, then opens the door with a key she must have lifted from an attendant.<br/><br/>"Mr. Tesla," she says, "I think we need to have a few words."<br/><br/>A decrepit, filthy old man is sitting in the bed. Pigeons are flying in and out through an open window, fluttering around the room.<br/><br/>"It would have worked!" says the man. "It still could! If we can just open the gate!"<br/><br/>He stares at Freddie. His face takes on an odd look. "Blakely, it's me, Aubrey! I don't know how I got in here--No! My name is Nicola, I was born in...in...there was...another. He is gone, gone, and now I am empty..."<br/><br/>Jackson opens a bag and takes out some extremely unusual looking electronics. Jimmy looks at them, and then at her for a long moment. "Katakatak?" he says.<br/><br/>Jax/Katakatak nods. "Too late. The Renegade must have transferred to Penhew before he went through the Gate. He was always the best of us at transfer, and time travel. Who knows what he will do now that he has gone through a Gate like that. He could have become...well, a powerful extradimensional entity."<br/><br/>"With a bad sense of humor?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Probably. Jimmy, Francis, why don't you do the honors? Strap these electrodes on either side of his head. It will kill the Penhew part and leave the Tesla."<br/><br/>While the two private eyes shock the old man, Jax/Katakatak shakes her head. "Poor child. The Renegade came to him when he was only six. All those long years, sharing the same mind, seeing all those things the Renegade knew...no wonder he's mad."<br/><br/>Jimmy hands back the equipment to her. Everyone stares for a second.<br/><br/>"Right, you probably want Jax back," says Katakatak. "Don't worry, we worked this all out on the Island. Come with me."<br/><br/><br/><br/>They drive in Jimmy's car for several hours, until they reach Providence, Rhode Island. "Pull in here," says Katakatak as they reach a gloomy old Colonial house.<br/><br/>"That name on the mailbox," says Jimmy, as they get out of the car. "Wasn't that the same one Vanessa--"<br/><br/>Katakatak bounds up the stairs and pulls the bell. A rather dour, long-faced man opens the door. His face breaks into a rather ghoulish grin when he sees Katakatak.<br/><br/>"Thank God you got here," he says. "This guy Howie has some very weird ideas about women."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"The thing is," says Howard/Katakaktak after the transfer is finished, "Some people are senstitives, like Tesla or our friend here. I just used his mind to stash Jax for a while, so I could confront Tesla after she located him for me. She wanted it to be her face that saw him, but I wouldn't let her risk her mind."<br/><br/>"And you're going to stay there?" says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Oh, no. I'm headed back to the past, to be with my people. As soon as one of our agents brings the device, I'm leaving."<br/><br/>"Will there be any long-term damage to Howard?"<br/><br/>"No. Maybe nightmares, the odd vision. Jax tells me he likes to write. Maybe he'll get some story ideas."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Well, Freddie, what about us two?" says Jax.<br/><br/>"It seems I have a lot of money, provided I never go back to England, a title, and the responsibility to help raise a godling."<br/><br/>"You can come with me," says Jimmy. <br/><br/>"Hollywood, eh?

What do you think is better--Brenda Starr, or Lois Lane?"<br/><br/>"Little comic," says Freddie.<br/><br/>"Ah, well, <i>quelle dommage</i>," says Jax. <br/><br/>She pauses.<br/><br/>"<i>Attendez une moment!

"I'll see you in Hollywood."<br/><br/>"See you there.

Together with Isabelle, they fight the supernatural with monsters, and occasionally pop over to California to help out Jimmy. The United States Government to this day refuses to confirm or deny his involvement with the OSS during World War II, or the CIA in the years following.<br/><br/><br/>If anything, Jimmy Wright does even <i>better</i> in Los Angeles. His normal practice runs well, and his discreetly provided supernatural services continue his good work. As the years go by, he helps many young investigators enter the private investigation trade; he keeps track of them all, Phil, Sam, J. J., that guy whatshisname who quit after only a little while to join the Continental Agency.<br/><br/><br/>Freddie starts Earl Pictures, specializing in horror and drawing room farce. He does stupidly well, of course, before getting out of the industry in the early 1960s. He sells some of his equipment to a young director-wanna-be named Roger Corman. He helps Vanessa raise Mirabelle...until she's old enough to be on her own.<br/><br/>Before he dies, Freddie pens a memoir called <i>It All Really Happened!</i> that he hoped would be a dire warning to humanity. The book was ignored before being revived by the Deconstructionists in the 1990s; one calls it "<i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> as written by P. G. Wodehouse."<br/><br/><br/>Jax quits the reporting business during the Depression. Freddie gives her some bit parts in his movies, and in time she becomes a respected stage actress. Her revival of <i>The Dollhouse</i> is well-reviewed in New York. Supposedly Stephen Sondheim wanted to offer her a part in <i>A Little Night Music</i>, but she dies before auditions begin.<br/><br/><br/>Vanessa moves to California, and soon becomes one of Venice Beach's most beloved eccentrics. In the 1960s, the hippies and stoners hang out at her old Victorian, where she dotes on them like a psychedelic den mother.<br/><br/><br/>Bradley Grey gives up the DA's job to move to California with his wife, Erica. After a hiatus, he goes into politics, eventually winning Richard Nixon's old seat in Congress.<br/><br/><br/>Mina Murray vanishes from the British Museum in 1946. Her MI-6 file merely says, "Missing, presumed immortal."<br/><br/><br/>But the story's not quite over yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even a King's word only lasts as long as his life, so in 1936 Freddie returns to England for the funeral of King George V. He is forced, thanks to his rank, to attend interminable dinners that even King Edward's notorious manners can't liven up.<br/><br/>During one of them, however, he runs into Wallis--Simpson, now, she tells him. They pick up where they left off in Shanghai.<br/><br/>"You know, Freddie," she tells him out on a terrace in the bracing winter air, "I really thought you would have recognized me in Shanghai."<br/><br/>Freddie stares. "Oh, God."<br/><br/>"Not exactly, you know. Dark Lord didn't give me <i>that</i> much power. But I had enough to not let a falling building kill me, even if I had to take over a socialite to do so."<br/><br/>"Oh, God."<br/><br/>"Am I not so recognizable? Anyway, I like it here now. I'm going to be Queen of England."<br/><br/>"Like that will ever happen, Hypatia."<br/><br/>"You never know. Besides, I like David--King Edward, I guess I should say. He's an idiot, but he's my idiot, and does what I tell him. Really hates you, though--he was behind the citizenship thing, you know."<br/><br/>"That was him?"<br/><br/>"Well he was in the  cult, you know."<br/><br/>"That explains that, then. And the car."<br/><br/>"Did you really call him Teddy?"<br/><br/>"Unfortunately. Have you checked in on your girls? Some of them lived."<br/><br/>"I let Mina play with her toys. By the way, Freddie, message from the Boss: Game's not over yet."<br/><br/>"I never wanted to play in the first place!"<br/><br/>"You don't get a choice, there, Freddie. But you'll probably be left alone. For a while. By the way, whatever happened to your friend Chuckles?"<br/><br/>"I haven't the faintest idea."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Charleston awakes with a start. He looks around. Grey walls, definitely  a prison.<br/><br/>Something scurries in the corner. He picks up the Rev and puts him on top of his head. He glances around looking for a window.<br/><br/>"Underground." He shakes his head, and then steps through the wall. Several minutes later he is staring out at the skyline of Berlin from the top of a building.<br/><br/>"You know, Rev, this dagger is just the start. We're going to be hunted wherever we go. I think it's time to go on the offensive. I'll learn some German, find some of those guys who do what I say, and start my own little faction. We'll gather all the artifacts of the world in one place, because I'll need them to defend me. Do you eat?"<br/><br/>"I think I live on thoughtwaves," says the Rev in his head.<br/><br/>"Then I don't need to take care of you much. Noor! I see you there! Come on, you didn't think I could pull it off!"<br/><br/>"No, I am impressed. It was good. Better if you really cared about humanity, but still, you saved Charleston. Or whatever's under all the crazy."<br/><br/>"Come on, baby. You know this is all Charleston."<br/><br/>"Ah, I was mislead. I lived such a terrible short life."<br/><br/>"You wanna come back?"<br/><br/>"No, I've seen how that works. I could never survive the diet."<br/><br/>"You know, I was going to go through the portal, until I saw you come to say goodbye, it reminded me--I owe that bastard! So, are we even?"<br/><br/>"You know, that's almost sweet. All right."<br/><br/>"What do you do when you're dead?"<br/><br/>"I used to haunt Jimmy, but that's done. I guess I could haunt you."<br/><br/>"Come on, for old times sake."<br/><br/>"I like the Rev. He's cute. You know, we should probably never let anyone else read your book. That's our knowledge."<br/><br/>"I was going to publish it! But maybe you're right. That's what I need you for. Practical stuff. You know, Mwimbe was traitorous, but she was right that these books aren't for everybody. I think we should gather them together, so only I can see them."<br/><br/>"Sure, for safety."<br/><br/>"Now, here's a thing. The hearing, the eyes, actually an improvement. Probably limit my dating, but then I can't trust anyone. So, I'm going to summon a hunting horror, cut off its wings, and graft them to my shoulders. That way I'll always have the mobility!"<br/><br/>"Why not? Sounds like a weekend."<br/><br/>"We'll need to fund this operation. You know what we should do? Start a candy company. That's how we'll fund it. We can learn how to do it here in Germany."<br/><br/><br/><br/>One day, in the 1930s, Charleston walks into a cabaret in Berlin. He glances at the bartender.<br/><br/>"Hello, Shakti," he says. "With the eyes, I can tell."<br/><br/>"Oh for goodness sake," moans Shakhti. "I understand you're in candy. Maybe you can use my club's name?"<br/><br/>"Kit Kat? I don't know. Did you hear what I did?"<br/><br/>"Yeah, he told me. Said he'd have done the same in your place. But it will probably be good if you don't see each other for a while."<br/><br/>"As long as he doesn't hold grudges!" They both laugh, and Shakhti hands Charleston a drink from the private stock. <br/><br/>"I'd like to make an investment in your company," says Shakhti. "I still seem to own several hundred acres of cotton. Nice pet, by the way."<br/><br/>Charleston puts the Rev on the bar. "He's not so much a pet as a...parasite."<br/><br/>"Like most of humanity."<br/><br/>"Tell me about it!" They clink glasses.<br/><br/>"Til the next time we try to rule the world," says Shakhti. "Now that you're on our side, I'm sure we'll do it right."<br/><br/>"You never know," says Charleston. "Depending on what I learn, maybe next time you'll be trying to stop...me."<br/><br/>In the background, a young American woman begins to sing:<br/><br/><i><br/>All the odds are in my favor<br/>Something's bound to begin<br/>It's got to happen, happen sometime<br/>Maybe this time I'll win<br/><br/>Maybe this time...<br/>Maybe this time...he'll stay</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern" title="hypomodern"><img alt="hypomodern" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hypomodern">hypomodern</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434441/#Comment_434441" name="Item_507" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T19:20:38+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  7:20PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434470/#Comment_434470" name="Item_508" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T13:35:31+00:00" title="June 27, 2014  1:35PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2014 1:36PM by Aviatrix.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Hypo &lt; 3 right back. <br/><br/>My holiday is wrapping up and I'll be in the States again soon, so when I get home I'll see if I can talk a bit about what I learned, and what I think about how the campaign developed.<br/><br/>For everyone who commented on this (very!) long thread, thanks.

So I was running a Pathfinder campaign that I wanted to be different...<br/><br/>Let's backtrack some more.<br/><br/>My first RPG was the old pink box Moldvay D&amp;D, a gift from my parents who had heard that "Dungeons and Dragons" was good for creativity. I was...nine or ten. But I really didn't start playing actively for a few years, when I finally had some folks to game with. This was mostly Traveller and AD&amp;D, conducted in marathon sessions (ah, youth!) and generally run by my friend, an improvisational DM with a flair for the baroque. So.<br/><br/>In college, I ran a 2nd Ed. D&amp;D game for about a year. The campaign was horribly railroady. Just awful. I was writing for me, not my players.<br/><br/>Then...nothing. For a long, long time. I'd game intermittently when I was with some of my friends (many who now lived in another state), but no regular gaming until four years ago, when I decided to go to a local meetup. From that, I ended up in a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/426089#Comment_426089" rel="nofollow">rather flawed game that I've written about previously</a>.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I had found another group, and we were playing 3.5...and Call of Cthulhu. <i>Masks of Nyarlathotep</i>, specifically. That game foundered when the GM got a better job that didn't give him time to prep. So I decided to finally start my own game, something I'd been talking about for a while. Out of my two groups I culled CP (from the "flawed" campaign) and PP and FP (from the Cthulhu game.)<br/><br/>So I was running a Pathfinder game, in my own campaign world, one I had designed to be a sort of "anti-D&amp;D". Except for humans and gnomes, none of the standard races were allowed. My inspiration looked towards Indian and Asian influences, not northern European myth. I played around with allowing more technology than you typically see in this kind of game. And it was a feminist, socialist utopia.<br/><br/>Except, of course, that it's really hard to run anti-D&amp;D when you're running...D&amp;D. (Not impossible. I tried!) I mean, system matters! And the system was set up with certain expectations that I did not feel it was fair to deprive the players of, although I did mess with them in some ways. (I stopped tracking XP, I basically just awarded treasure for magic items at various points.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I was looking around on the web, trying to find ways to reduce my prep time. This led me to various readings on how to improvise better, and I came to a surprising realization: I didn't suck at improv. I was, in fact, pretty good at it. I had never suspected this before!<br/><br/>And finally, it led me to Ben Robbins and Ars Ludi. And I began to replicate his journey: moving through the idea of making d20 more narrative towards looking to play fullblown narrativist games.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, even with my vastly reduced prep, the prep was still onerous. (Justin Alexander's <a href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach" rel="nofollow">excellent series on node-based design</a> helped a lot--and was the inspiration to take a look at <i>Masks</i> again, since he highlights it as an example of the design.) Running combat took too long, and frankly, was boring to me. But it still needed to be prepped! I was getting sick of it. So as the campaign neared the close, I decided that my next project was to run a pre-existing campaign, something I could maybe do a one-time pass through to adjust it to my taste and then just run it.<br/><br/>I decided to go with <i>Masks</i>. As the Pathfinder game wound up, I started to get much more excited about running <i>Masks</i>, because I was already beginning to Have Ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435188/#Comment_435188" name="Item_517" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-13T08:10:33+00:00" title="July 13, 2014  8:10AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep: An Afterword, of Sorts (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>There was one big problem with doing <i>Masks</i>, however. Two of my players had already gone through most of it. This simple fact was the birthplace of...well, a lot in the long run. I've whacked the hell out of the campaign, mutating it almost, but not quite, out of recognition.<br/><br/>But it was supposed to be much simpler. I thought what I could do was move some of the locations around, and move some of the episodes in each location to different locations, preventing anticipation. There was some stuff we hadn't gotten to during our runthrough. (And the GM himself changed stuff, starting with the year--it was 1927 in his campaign.) Plus, I could add some original material, and move bits of the original campaign material to these new locations. There was plenty of stuff. It wouldn't be too hard.<br/><br/>So this is why London became Paris, and Shanghai largely became Calcutta. (In my original conception; as it played out, Shanghai was still more important.) A special note on the latter move--it turns out Calcutta has one of the few Chinatowns in all of India, so my plan was for the picture of the <i>Dark Mistress</i> to be a fakeout, actually taken in Calcutta. (Also, I just like India and wanted to get that into the game; like Paris subbing for London, it was a case of knowing the environment better.) We had never gone to Australia, so I left that untouched, and left New York untouched since...we all live here :-)<br/><br/>I decided to add Irem in as a coda to the Egypt section, because I thought Irem was cool (and I was starting to have plans for Hypatia). I found a very creepy little story about the City of Brass in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, so I stole unabashedly from it for that part. Kerguelen came from an idea I had while working through some of the implications of my moves--in the regular campaign, the Gate is opened simultaneously from three points that make an isosceles triangle on the map. But I was moving stuff! But I noticed one day that if I used an island in the far Southern Ocean, I could make an upside-down Elder Sign (Derleth version). And in the center...were some little islands, perfect for moving the Grey Dragon Island stuff from the original campaign. And in fact...one was named Danger Island.<br/><br/>That was too good to pass up. Plus, I could get the Elder Things in the Kerguelen section, which sounded fun.<br/><br/>The Germans and the <i>Emden</i> take on the role provided by the Japanese in the regular campaign; I liked the idea of using the Germans, given the players' knowledge of what lies in the future for them. (I dabbled with the idea of using the Soviets, but as it turns out the <i>Emden</i> really did cruise the Indian Ocean a lot, so it seemed a nice fit, especially when I found out Doenitz was its future captain. Although the real ship was not actually launched until later in 1925.)<br/><br/>Finally, I had some plans to set the game in an alternative universe, since then the players could not rely on their knowledge of history. <i>Technically</i>, this was true in the campaign as it played out, but practically it had no effect. My original ideas were much more radical--having Tesla's ideas adopted earlier, maybe having W. R. Hearst as president--but in the end there was no real need to do anything like that.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's leading me to what was far more important than the reskinning of the locations: the motivation and personality of the Conspiracy.<br/><br/><b>How to Hack a Campaign: a Primer</b><br/><br/>I almost never run any published adventures as written. <br/><br/>I mean, you really <i>can't</i>; not to get all deconstructionist, but no matter what you, as the GM, are going to respond to the situations created by the players and probably deviate in ways small and large. Stuff happens. <br/><br/>But the real reason I never run anything as written is that frankly, the motivations of the NPCs are almost universally <i>terrible</i>. And <i>Masks</i>, for all its enormous virtues, sadly falls into this category.<br/><br/>OK, sure. It doesn't really matter, of course; the Conspirators are just Boss encounters on some level, they're trying to let the Mythos descend to Earth, that's all you really need to go own. I guarantee you can play it like that and it will work.<br/><br/>But...I think it will be better my way. Because the NPCs will come alive more. Because you will be able to predict their responses, empathize with them, <i>understand</i> them. Because conflict and drama come from character, and if you don't give the PCs characters to butt up against, you'll lack drama.<br/><br/>I looked at the conspiracy. The first thing I did was to create a Biggest Bad, somebody central to their plans and directing them--but not Nyarlathotep; that was too easy. I took some of my ideas about Tesla and slotted him in; at some point, the idea of him being a hiding place for a Yithian renegade clicked, and so I wrote that in. This was the Old Man, and I stitched him into some other ideas I had begun to formulate.<br/><br/>Because somewhere in my planning, I decided on my mostly tongue-in-cheek name for the campaign. I planned for it to use pastiche, to make allusions concrete; so I pulled in Stoker (and Alan Moore!) and Verne and some other stuff as well. (The Stoker stuff in particular worked out very well, in the end.)<br/><br/>Then I began to look at the conspirators, and try and get a feel for all of them. The women attracted me first; they seemed the most undeveloped in the actual campaign, and the most...put upon. M'Weru's characterization is borderline racists (she has most of the "Jungle" movie iconography associated with her), and Hypatia....is literally an incubator.<br/><br/>That would not stand.<br/><br/>M'Weru emerged first. I decided that she would not have received an infodump from the Big N, but actually be a cultured, highly intelligent and educated person in her own right. Her seething contempt of the colonial powers was <i>earned</i>, because she was not just their victim, but someone who had ascended into their own power structure. From this came the idea of having be in New York to start the campaign, watching over the Bloody Tongue cult.<br/><br/>And then it occurred to me that if I could get the PCs to bring her along with them...that would be incredible.<br/><br/>So, Dr. Mwimbe, one of my favorite characters to play, emerged first--proud, fiercely intelligent, and incredibly powerful.<br/><br/>Hypatia was next. I decided to link her to Nitocris, rather than introduce an undeveloped NPC into the game. This meant making her magic, but I was fine with that; over time, the idea of just <i>how</i> magic expanded into what you saw in these write-ups. The problem of having the resurrection scene AND having Hypatia be in Irem was a tough nut to crack, although I finally came up with a solution, as you saw. I had already grasped the idea of making Hypatia ambiguous--not on the PCs side, but not really working against them; she wasn't really in the modern conspiracy plot, but once she became active she started to bend it towards her own designs.<br/><br/>Shakhti was next, because I found the character woefully underwritten. He's not a formal member of the Conspiracy in the regular campaign--more their man on the ground--but I decided to make him more integral. His background was actually more important, so I hit upon pseudo-vampirism. I went looking for a major figure from myth for him--I initially thought about Cain, but him being the first vampire seems to only be a White Wolf thing--before hitting on Gilgamesh. Shakhti was about power, pure and simple. I decided to make him cultured and urbane, a devotee of cat and mouse games.<br/><br/>Aubrey and Huston and Ho Fong were more difficult. In the end, Aubrey was somewhat colorless; the idea that he was going through the portal was a fairly late one. Huston...I was never sure of how to play. I didn't really want to go with the megalomaniac, but in the end that was how I played him. (Basing his accent and portrayal on Noah Cross, from <i>Chinatown</i>, certainly made that more likely.) Ho Fong I went back and forth and back and forth on; I wanted his daughter to be more interesting (and so I raised her age), but I wasn't sure if she was a) Ho Fong via some "Thing on the Doorstep" soul transfer b) an immortal spirit from China's past, or c) just a really gifted young woman. In the end I went with d) Omar Shakhti, mostly because my players kept expecting that shoe to drop so I gave it to them.<br/><br/>Then I drew a chart, showing the relationships between the conspirators. At the heart of it was the rivalry between M'Weru and Shakhti, which I've discussed before; Hypatia I had as being close to M'Weru, and indifferent to Omar. In play, however, I luckily hit upon the much better idea of Shakhti and Hypatia being bitter rivals--two immortal demigods dueling over the millennia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435213/#Comment_435213" name="Item_518" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-13T23:16:10+00:00" title="July 13, 2014 11:16PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating.

But what I was doing--at first without realizing it--was in fact a <i>reboot</i>. This became more obvious as I began discussing it here, where at some point I realized I was crossing Ronald Moore BSG with Joss Whedon Buffy.<br/><br/><b>How to Hack a Reboot: A Primer</b><br/><br/>Reboots are tricky things.<br/><br/>If you deviate too far, no one will recognize what you've done. Leave things too much the same, and people will wonder what the point of the whole exercise was.<br/><br/>We seem to be living in the Age of the Reboot, most notably (for geekdom) the Ronald Moore BSG and the JJ Abrams Star Trek. Both men made fairly bold choices in tinkering with canon, although I think only one of them managed to improve the project in the long run. (Sorry, JJ.) Let's talk about what I did in rebooting <i>Masks</i>.<br/><br/>Probably the most important step in rebooting something is to take a look at the theme of the piece and then decide what themes are more relevant to you and your audience--and perhaps comment a bit on the original work. In the case of <i>Masks</i>, the campaign as a whole was pretty advanced on the subject of racism, to a lesser degree on colonialism, and not at all that good about sexism and homophobia. Since the last two are fairly dear to me, I knew that in my game I'd emphasize both of them more. I also felt that ramping up the examination of colonialism was called for, both as a commentary on the modern economic world and to create some tension between the Pulp tropes of the benevolent colonial powers and the actual horrors of colonialism.<br/><br/>Let's address the queerness of <i>Masks</i> first. Honestly, when I played the campaign, I just naturally assumed that Roger Carlyle and Jack Brady were lovers; I mean, when you look at the actual text, Roger's decision to use all his resources to free a roughneck ex-Marine is very weird and never properly explained. I guess I assumed there was a subtext there. I've actually been surprised to discover this seems to be a minority view! However, I decided to make this explicit; Episode I made several mentions of the suspicions that Jack and Roger were lovers.<br/><br/>Now...I had some other ideas on how to push it. Roger's transness was a bit of a delicate and personal subject to me, and I hesitated including it; but for whatever reason, it just clicked with me, and plus it allowed me to have an ongoing low-level mystery (who was Vanessa?) that kept people guessing. For the record, my conception had Roger <i>Vane</i> Carlyle as having always been trans and Erica having been more accepting of this when they were younger; thus she knew full well who Vanessa was--not her dead brother so much as a secret about him that she found embarrassing.<br/><br/>(Odd, when I talk about fictional trans people my pronoun usage is terrible. Roger was always Vanessa; M'Weru and the Big N just gave her what she most desired.)<br/><br/>The campaign actually ended up being pretty queer. In my mind, Hypatia certainly was some kind of omnisexual who probably preferred women and had been Mwimbe's lover at some point; there's Desmond Motombo and Captain Hardekker; Joyce Summers; and of course Taro Isoge. (In the regular campaign, he's a Japanese Naval Intelligence officer--and maybe in mine, as well. Though gay. Very gay.) Even in Jax's diary I had an episode where she was helped out by a gay couple.<br/><br/>...and that leads me to the women, and most especially to Jax.<br/><br/>I'm not sure when the idea of flipping Jackson Elias' gender came to me. It was fairly early on--probably as I was reading the campaign all the way through for the first time, and looking for ways to give women more roles. Whatever was the cause of the inspiration, it hit like a thunderbolt and was the single most important thing I did in the reboot. If I had changed nothing else, I think having a female Jackson Elias would still have had major changes on the campaign.<br/><br/>For one thing, it made me like Jax more. I probably couldn't have written the diary had I not been writing it as a woman. Having Jax be a plucky feminist making her way in a man's world gave me both insight and a nice cliche to hang my portrayal on. And then, purely by random happenstance, FP ended up being Jax's former fiancee! Think of how much came from that simple die roll! (I'll touch more on the Fiasco playsets later.)<br/><br/>Perhaps most importantly, having made that major break, I felt...empowered to make others, large and small, which fed into my decisions both on how to manipulate the actual text and in how the NPCs were motivated.<br/><br/>Whatever else, it made Jax live and breathe for me, and that made it much easier for me to accomplish one of my major early goals: to make Jackson a living character for the players as well, to make them feel her absence and give them a real reason to press on.<br/><br/>I've already touched on what I did for M'Weru and Hypatia; let's just say that this was in the spirit of the changes I made with Jax. Likewise, it made it easier for me to punch up Erica Carlyle from annoying socialite to a hard-headed business woman, cheated by her gender from assuming her rightful place at the head of her family's business. (The regular text seems to assume she's Roger's younger sister; I made her the older sister, and so doubly cheated of her inheritance.)<br/><br/>After that, deepening the investigation of colonialism wasn't too hard; I just needed to play it up in Egypt and then Tanganyika. Having Mwimbe around to issue acerbic commentary to the players kept it fun for me, and in any case the regular text is fairly good on racism. I decided early on to include the <i>Nautilus</i> (seriously, it's in Jax's journal if you look for it), which is another symbol of anti-colonialism. (Making Marlowe the captain was a later inspiration, but one that made a great deal of sense.)<br/><br/>Finally, although not crucially, there was the character of Nyarlathotep him...her...itself. The nightclub entrance was an old, old idea, probably one of the first I ever had about the campaign, and fit with how I wanted to portray the Messenger: sarcastic, omnipotent, and always in on the joke. These things he does are <i>games</i> to him; he doesn't have a stake in how they finish, merely in how they're played. At the same time, I did want to preserve some sense of menace from him, which I tried to do in his later appearances, especially when he appeared to Jimmy on the ship and the Rev in Australia and Singapore.<br/><br/>So armed with my revised NPC relationship map and my rebooted sensibilities, it was time to start playing the game...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435362/#Comment_435362" name="Item_521" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T22:10:03+00:00" title="July 15, 2014 10:10PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there an actual R-map, a diagram?

And in fact I ran a preliminary session--a somewhat hacked "Dead Man's Stomp"--for PP and CP under CoC. (At the time, I had some cockeyed plan of running a few introductory sessions. We only did this one, but it introduced female Jax and Charleston Chiu to the world.)<br/><br/>But I soon began to have issues with the CoC rules. They're crunchier than you think. There's no out of the box point-buy. The language rules are all messed up.

At one point I was thisclose to doing a Fate conversion, although lacking Fate Core it probably wouldn't have been that great.<br/><br/>Ultimately I went with Trail of Cthulhu, not least because someone had converted three of the chapters to the Trail rules. (Which reminds me: I need to finish the conversion I started of the last two, as a service to humanity.) I seemed to <i>get</i> Trail right off the bat, although it seems I took a more expansive view of what buys could do than the core rules supported. (Later Gumshoe games have tended to support my view, though.)<br/><br/>This is skipping ahead a bit, but I might as well talk about some of the things I observed about the Trail rules in the course of play:<br/><br/>--The standard Sources of Stability rules aren't awesome, and are particularly unsuited for Masks. The version in <i>Night's Black Agents</i> is pretty much superior in every way, and I'd recommend anyone interested in long-term campaign play to adopt them. The only place the standard rules might be better would be in a "monster of the week" style game, as it makes the "your relative just died" opening to many CoC adventures a little easier to justify ("one of my sources thought he saw a ghost...")<br/><br/>--The Contacts rules in NBA should probably also come in to Trail, I think they're thematically appropriate with some reskinning.<br/><br/>--Maybe it's my group, but folks didn't like the Stability checks at all. Up above somewhere I discussed the idea of making them a fixed cost rather than a roll, which I think would work better.<br/><br/>--The contest rules are not awesome. I started to avoid contests because they were an unfair drain on the PCs resources, in my opinion. This may vary by playstyle, of course--in a more Purist game, they probably make more sense. (But I pretty much am incapable of being a Purist GM.)<br/><br/>...but otherwise I thought they worked very well. CP didn't love the resource management aspect, although I think some of that may just be packaging--we all kept very complicated character sheets going when we played Pathfinder.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437182/#Comment_437182" name="Item_524" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T15:42:12+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  3:42PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep: An Afterword, of Sorts (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>I don't know if I did anything particularly innovative in the campaign--my reskinnings and gender-flips are in the playbook of most rebooters--but I did have one good idea that I am proud of: using the Fiasco playsets to create character background.<br/><br/>I am of the firm belief that a lived backstory is going to be better than even the most detailed canned backstory. It gives the players a common reference point, and in the no-pressure environment of the Fiasco playset everyone could just freeplay their characters.<br/><br/>The randomness of the playset...is a more delicate subject. I'm not sure it's a better fit than, say, the Pathways system of Cortex Plus Drama. Folks need to be onboard with it. And yet...we got a lot of mileage out of some of the more interesting rolls. Most important, of course, was Freddie's relationship with Jax. In the first half of the campaign, when the sessions were haunted by her presence, this gave things a poignancy that I don't think I could have planned out. And it also built some tension into Freddie's relationship with Sheila. (Having tension around FP is good--he's a master of deflection, so I looked for ways to pull him into dramatic situations.)<br/><br/>Likewise, Francis being Jax's cousin added a touch of sweetness to a very bitter character, I think. It gave us a glimpse into the side of Francis that could have been happily married.<br/><br/>And as it turned out, not having CP available for any of the Fiasco runs was a great foreshadowing for how disconnected Charleston would turn out to be.<br/><br/>I made three playsets for the game. (I worked on another two, but those were basically hacks of existing playsets and not custom-made like the others.) The first was pretty straightforward; I'd decided that the end of WWI made sense for the first time these characters would cross paths, so I threw together a bunch of cool stuff I brainstormed.<br/><br/>The second playset was more fun, although I struggled more with the writing--I was working on a Gatsbyesque New York playset, with locations scattered around the Big Apple, including of course a party on Long Island. It wasn't very inspired. Practically the night before the session I finally realized that what I really wanted was <i>just</i> the party, and with a little work I could map all the locations to the party itself.<br/><br/>Of the three we did, that one was my favorite, not the least because it introduced Jimmy and Francis, and we saw the Jax/Freddie romance for about the last time.<br/><br/>The final playset, however, I'm rather stupidly proud of, because it tried to break the mold by having all the locations be points in the life of Jackson Elias. As such it's not really playable outside my campaign, although I think the idea deserves more exploration. The actual game wasn't as good as I would have liked--we never got a chance to develop some of the weirdness around Franz--but the mirror reflection captures of Freddie and Francis were some of my favorite moments out of all the Fiasco gaming.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437185/#Comment_437185" name="Item_525" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T16:03:29+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  4:03PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep: An Afterword, of Sorts (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>One thing I didn't really expect was the amount of player turnover I had.<br/><br/>I knew that PP would be moving eventually, although at first we thought he would move about a year later than he did. It does me no credit to have been relieved that at least I wouldn't have to deal with Pearkes anymore. (CP actually advised me to kill Pearkes off after the first session. I'm not sorry I didn't follow his advice, but I <i>would</i> have saved me some headaches...)<br/><br/>Pearkes was just a weird scenario. Somehow PP and I--who usually had no issues--weren't talking the same language in-game. I'm really not exactly sure how it got so bad, although it was mostly my fault that it did. About the only thing I can fault PP for was something I hadn't really figured out yet--to wit, that if you're planning to have your PC make a major life change (and all along PP told me he was intending George to break out of his Imperial chauvinism), you need to do it <i>very early</i>. This is one of those places where the weird interaction between being both participant and audience in an RPG comes in. <br/><br/>Or more basically, play the character you intend to play as soon as you can, because being a jerk for forty hours will wear thin.<br/><br/>I made one huge mistake with Pearkes that I blame Bill White for. (Just kidding, Bill.) That was killing off Sam Steele so quickly. PP got penalized there for having made the only usable list of Sources of Stability, and I wanted to kill one off early. But it was a horrible mistake. Sam could have been there for much longer, letting PP boss him around to his heart's content and needing therefore to boss the other PCs around much less.<br/><br/>Losing BP early on ended up not being as big a deal as I feared it would be. While I enjoy playing with BP, and had some plans for Blount as the "audience-identification" character, the core chemistry between PP, CP, FP and I carried us through, along with GP, whose dry wit and easygoing manner made him very enjoyable to game with.<br/><br/>And then of course, we lost PP and I somewhat haphazardly recruited OP and JP from my Tuesday night group.<br/><br/>And they ended up making the campaign.<br/><br/>By the time JP joined, GP was mostly out of the picture, and JP quickly took the same slot. She is an absolute delight to game with, especially when you're a GM--she's always willing to bite on a plot hook, her easygoing and funny manner relaxes everyone, and most of all she <i>doesn't mind risking her character</i>. FP and CP--FP especially--were always more cautious or willing to hold back and wait for me to explain things. But JP always went at the story hard.<br/><br/>OP is a different matter. His primary PCs tend to be near-sociopathic manipulators, but my experience has always been that as good as he is at playing those kinds of characters--and he's very, very good at playing them--he's even better playing good guys. Francis was easily the most layered character, the one who had the best arc, and in a lot of ways the solid pillar that I built the second half of the campaign on. It was really fine work and I frankly can't imagine the campaign now without him.<br/><br/>It was a neat trick, replacing half the cast midway through the game, but we somehow pulled it off, and built a group with excellent chemistry. (Currently we're playing in CP's 13th Age game. I'm a sociopathic fire sorceress. OP is a manipulative elf who's totally not a necromancer. JP is everybody's fixer and FP is the world's dumbest fighter. It's a lot of fun.)<br/><br/>Since I'm handing out compliments to my players, a word about FP and CP.<br/><br/>FP had the time of his life with Freddie. He had always wanted to play Bertie Wooster, and he ate it up. In retrospect, I think the citizenship angle I played wasn't really an awesome move, although the "Freddie Blakeley, feared terrorist" angle ended up being an excellent running gag. I was trying to find a handle on FP, and it wasn't really working--but I shouldn't have been going straight at his central character concept. By the end of the campaign, though, Freddie finally started to have a bit of an arc.<br/><br/>This was another example of me getting stuff wrong, by the way. I let FP's remarkable charisma--and his Freddie accent is spot on, perfectly plummy and a comic masterpiece--make me try and use him as the campaign's dramatic center. (Of course, until OP showed up, he <i>was</i> the best choice.) But drama isn't FP's thing, and I shouldn't have tried to pigeonhole him.<br/><br/>About CP, what can I say. He never forgot he was in a horror game. He is a very, very funny person and this comes through in how he played Charleston. The Rev was likewise about 200% more brilliant than anything I could have come up with on my own. And...well, you saw how things ended.<br/><br/>He won the damn campaign.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437240/#Comment_437240" name="Item_526" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T08:55:45+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  8:55AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2014 8:57AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>About the only thing I can fault PP for was something I hadn't really figured out yet--to wit, that if you're planning to have your PC make a major life change (and all along PP told me he was intending George to break out of his Imperial chauvinism), you need to do it <i>very early</i>.

I have yet to see the "I plan for my character to eventually have this change in heart or status" actually pay off, and I've seen it completely fail and ruin that player's enjoyment too many times to allow it as a GM any more.  Start off as the character you actually want to play, not that character's chrysalis.<br/><br/>There is a closely related fail state, where everyone assumes their characters will meet during play and become best buds (as opposed to having met before play and formed relationships already), which in my experience INEVITABLY leads to something going wrong during the initial meet that sours relations forever.

What could go wrong?<br/><br/>I'll leave it up to you to judge what did or didn't. But here's a few things that surprised me, a few things that I wanted to happen but didn't, and some notes on my favorite sessions.<br/><br/>I never expected CP to take Charleston down the path of sorcery. Lord knows he resisted my attempts to actually bring Charleston into the world of sorcery, although to be fair, "Noah Cross" was a bit of a trap. But as noted above, CP never forgot he was in a horror game, and I guess he decided that <i>somebody</i> had to go insane.<br/><br/>Likewise, the Freddie-Jax romance and how it ultimately played out was a shocker from the first. I still haven't asked FP why he decided to focus on Sheila and lose Jax, although I'm sure he'll have a very reasoned response. But in the early part of the campaign it carried the emotional weight of the drama, so I must thank him for it.<br/><br/>I had hoped to get more India into the game, but when I decided that session 17 would wrap the campaign there just wasn't time. In any case, it was a bit of a silly fake-out, and I could have easily dropped it in a pinch.<br/><br/>Random stuff that I imagined but never happened: a moonlit shootout between Gavigan and Francis on the Acropolis; Francis time-travelling thanks to Hypatia back to the day Isabelle died; Dr. Mwimbe being discovered in Egypt, and promptly using magic to make her discoverer into a duplicate of herself before setting the duplicate loose naked and without Arabic in the desert; the Black Sphinx; M and Hypatia walking down a quay in Paris; more stuff with the Dreamlands; Alphonse Gilbert navigating the fictional worlds trying to free the other PCs; Charleston working as a photographer in California during the late '60s; and the final double-Fiasco playset, where the PCs would start at the opening of the Flamingo in Las Vegas, 1947, only to be transported midway to 1983 London where they were all actors on the ITV series <i>Masks</i>, written by Larry DeTillo--and they would all be actors who had the same first name as the actual players. (That last one would be the prize Easter Egg on the Blu-Ray set.)<br/><br/>My favorite overall episodes were probably IX (Francis and Jimmy vs. the werewolves), XII (Clipper ship!) and the first session. Episode VI (Metafiction!) comes close but just misses the satisfaction of the others. The finale was very good but a bit rushed. Episode X (Venice!) had the best explosions and a true action-movie finish.<br/><br/>These were my favorite NPCs to play: Hypatia, especially with Freddie; Jax, with anyone; Billy and Mickey, because I could do accents; and Dr. Mwimbe. Honorable mention should go to poor Sam Steele.<br/><br/>And of course Nyarlathotep.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how he came off, to be honest, but I enjoyed the everliving daylights out of playing him. I guess I saw him as some kind of Coyote or cosmically powerful Bugs Bunny--always in on the joke and not really caring who won or lost so long as he held all the cards. I know there was a danger of him coming off as too jokey, so I tried to keep the hidden menace buried just below the surface. I consciously gave him a break for a while after Episode VI, to keep him from getting too familiar; IIRC, it wasn't until Episode XII that he made a reappearance, and that was unscheduled (had the players not decided to pursue the "what killed that freighter?" angle, he wouldn't have shown up at all.) But his later appearances--nearly always centered on Charleston--let me pursue the menace more closely. In that regard, the meeting between "Omar" and Charleston in Australia and then in the jail cell in Singapore were my favorite bits--especially the latter, where I got to fence quite nicely with CP.<br/><br/>In the end, I think I saw N as a bit of a tragic figure. He's always going to be alone--he is uniquely who he is, and no one will ever <i>really</i> approach his level. His hard sell to Charleston can be interpreted as trying to find someone, anyone he can <i>talk</i> to. And in the end he failed at that.<br/><br/>Not that he cares, really. Throw this hand in and deal another.

I just need to figure out how to corrupt the PC learning magic by giving him something he'll use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441063/#Comment_441063" name="Item_531" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-29T17:22:52+00:00" title="December 29, 2014  5:22PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a late Christmas present, I give you:<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBORnJxdENLWUZWLVU/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">The Zanzibar Notes of Jackson Elias</a>: a prop I made for the Zanzibar episodes, written in Jax's somewhat idiosyncratic handwriting.<br/><br/>Here's two scans of the campaign's Ultimate Prop--the journal of Jackson Elias.<br/><br/><a href="http://imgur.com/oGOGYRw" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/oGOGYRw.jpg" title="source: imgur.com"/></a><br/><br/>This is the journal open to one of my favorite parts--Jax recounting a camping trip with Henry Armitage in the woods above Arkham.<br/><br/><a href="http://imgur.com/wWzJc11" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/wWzJc11.jpg" title="source: imgur.com"/></a><br/><br/>This is the outer appearance of the journal.<br/><br/><a href="https://eternal-lies-the-masks-of-the-liar.obsidianportal.com/" rel="nofollow">And finally, something of an announcement</a> :-)<br/><br/><br/><br/>...featuring the return of Jimmy Wright!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441196/#Comment_441196" name="Item_532" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-06T03:40:07+00:00" title="January  6, 2015  3:40AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whee!
