Dragons!) is mistaken for the internal mechanism. You can write a wizard soap opera, a wizard teenage drama, a wizard action movie, a wizard noir, a wizard psychological thriller -- you just take any of those genres and then put everybody in wizard robes and have them explain things in terms of wizardry.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that lots of other people don't make the same mistake -- so in a sense your ten-years-ago statement was correct as well, in that at the time the social consensus probably was that wizards = geeky. It's just that this turned out to be a much flimsier connection than most people thought, so it wasn't all that hard to displace and change, by associating a geeky coat of paint with a much more powerful, mainstream building.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not really confident enough to try and define 'fantasy' and 'pulp', but I am confident that there are elements that define those genres that go deeper than whether someone has a wizard's cloak, if there are elves, or whether or not the barbarian has a really big sword. <br/><br/>And for that matter, now that I think about it, maybe most of the geeky gamer culture that is attached to these genres <i>is also making this mistake</i>, and it will turn out that it really doesn't take much to pull them in completely different directions.<br/><br/>Which leads me in turn to a question to Jasper, I guess -- are you talking about the trappings of pulp and fantasy, or some deeper structural elements? Which do you think form the attraction and which lead to the stigma/alienation/whatever that you're thinking about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jasper%20Polane" title="Jasper Polane"><img alt="Jasper Polane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jasper%20Polane">Jasper Polane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59490/#Comment_59490" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T02:28:09+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  2:28AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I see it, using these genres in RPGs is <i>always </i>the result of remembering (and maybe misplaced nostalgia about) other RPGs.

Playing present RPG's usually involves an extensive set-up time, fairly complicated rules, and a pay-off that usually takes a couple hours to arrive. (I realize this paragraph isn't specifically on-point, but I feel it often gets overlooked.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMore on-point, it seems like RPG's involve a couple different tasks: (a) playing a game, (b), telling a story, and (c) pretending to be someone else, (d) anything else I've overlooked.  So, if you're trying to reach an audience outside of the traditional gamers, good questions to start out with might include:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

Everyone enjoys a little bit of escapism now and then.  To me it seems like the trick is to make it more like a parlor game: rules that fit on a single sheet of paper, complete cycle of play lasting under an hour, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59594/#Comment_59594" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T09:29:12+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  9:29AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think Jasper's got it right that the geekiness of things like D&amp;D are somehow linked to the fantasy tropes, but the objections Daniel and Joe raise are important. too. Obviously, it's not just the trappings, because Harry Potter, children's books or not, appeals to a huge number of people of all ages. Why?</p>\n<p>I think it's not just the tropes, but the way they are used, the way heroic fantasy literature focuses on the mere things and not on the broad meanings behind those things. Harry Potter, despite being filled with magic, isn't about wizards at all. What the non-geek masses find so distasteful about heroic fantasy is the obsession with fantasy and medieval minutiae.</p>\n<p>D&amp;D and most other fantasy RPGs are worse. The geekiness of D&amp;D lies in its obsession on how dragons are able to breathe fire, how beholders are able to float, how medusae are able to mate, how the body parts of these various creatures can be used to recreate similar effects in potions or magic items. It's the obsession with fantasy tactics: which spell is the right one to use when encountering a troll? What combos produce a synergistic effect?

So why do we keep returning to these genres?</blockquote>\nBy way of one possible answer, let me tell you about what happened in the local game I'm running right now.<br><br>I came up with this setting for a Fate game that was part sword-and-sorcery, part anime, part Arabian Nights. My girlfriend was going to be in this game, so one day we talked a bit about how sword-and-sorcery isn't very nice to women most of the time. She didn't have much experience with the genre, so we went out with a copy of Ron Edwards' <i>Sorcerer and Sword</i> and picked out a book or two from its bibliography.<br/><br/>She went on to create a member of a semi-religious order of all-female gravekeepers, whose job it was to cleanly bury the dead, oversee funerals, and perform the rituals that would calm their spirits ('cause in the setting, the dead aren't going properly to the afterlife right now). Allowed to live off of whatever they can salvage from the corpses (i.e. abject poverty) these women wield a double-edged social influence - they are necessary in their communities, but they are shunned by most as a reminder of human mortality. Their role in society transcends political concerns, too, so the movements of kings and princes couldn't matter less to them, as all die equally and are equally in need of their services. Because the character's job involves defending gravesites against robbers and the occassional toe-to-toe with an angry ghost, she's also quite danger-ready.<br/><br/>And I thought to myself, "Hmm... let's see... outsider from the world at large? Check. Fiercely independent set of motives? Check. Willingness to overturn established social orders to carve her own place in the world? Check." And so it turns out, her character is more true to genre than any of the others in the group, all without any of the imagery you're talking about.<br/><br/>Then, we turn around and agree she has a twin sister whom she's estranged from, who fell into life as a courtesan for the upper class of the city-state where the campaign primarily takes place. Their relationship, and their commentary on their respective life choices, has become a huge source of thematic content in the campaign, and a big part of the reason why it has a lot of the emotional resonance that it does.<br/><br/>To a large degree, I think we can return to these genres because we don't believe that their worst aspects necessarily define them. Or, for story gamers, because those bad aspects give us something to say.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59616/#Comment_59616" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T10:31:10+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 10:31AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My post was eaten a while ago, but I'll rewrite it:<br/><br/>Harry Potter books aren't exclusively children's books. I know of millions of people my age (18-20 bracket) and adults who avidly read Harry Potter. I don't think blaming their success on their demographic is helpful.<br/><br/>What Harry Potter is, as Shreyas and Daniel both mentioned in ways, is a story about people first. Not wizarding. Not secret trains.<br/><br/>It includes those elements to great wonderment and excitement, but it is a story about teenage struggles, coming of age, and realizing what the world has to offer you.<br/><br/>I find it all too rare that fantasy actually DOES that. And, no, I don't think Trollbabe does that, in its marketing. I'm going to paste the first bit of the About Trollbabe here. I'll stop whenever I hit something about relationships:\n<blockquote>What's a trollbabe? <br/><br/>Let's start with size. We're talking 6'6" at the least, with a build to match - a trollbabe is a big woman, no little aerobicized butts allowed. All trollbabes are strong, easily the match of the strongest humans, and ranging up from there. They can run all day and heft weapons and pull bows that would wear out a human in moments. Trollbabes have primarily-human facial features, and most lack the characteristic trollish body hair and posture. Their trollishness is most obvious in their horns, which range from short goaty pointy horns to big curling sheepy horns that include a ridge over their brows. Big hair is also common; think 80s rock-and-roll. <br/><br/>Why play Trollbabe? <br/><br/>Because a trollbabe is neither troll nor human - she is functionally apart, yet tied into the fates and interactions of both peoples. </blockquote>\nSo, if we're looking at involving a 20-year old female friend of mine in a genre, and de-geeking that genre, Trollbabe is probably not going to help.<br/><br/>First, the title Trollbabe is itself somewhat marginalizing. Second, the first 2/3s of the description page is about the trollbabe's physical appearance - that's right, it's a man's description of how these women look (and is written in a VERY male tone). Third, some of those sentences like "no little aerobicized butts allowed" can be seen as downright degrading or insulting. Offputting in the least.<br/><br/>So, I totally disagree that Trollbabe works to de-geek the fantasy genre by making it about real people and real relationship and the kind of stuff that actually matters in stories. At least on the surface.<br/><br/>Landon's description of getting his wife into S&amp;S is hella cool, as an off-hand thumbs up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59618/#Comment_59618" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T10:34:22+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 10:34AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>The geekiness of D&amp;D lies in its obsession on how dragons are able to breathe fire, how beholders are able to float, how medusae are able to mate, how the body parts of these various creatures can be used to recreate similar effects in potions or magic items. It's the obsession with fantasy tactics: which spell is the right one to use when encountering a troll? What combos produce a synergistic effect? It's page after page of medieval weapons and armor and their unique bonuses and penalties.</blockquote>\nThis. Right here. Yes.<br/><br/>The "geekiness" is not in having dragons and beholders. The "geekiness" is in trying to turn them into concrete, rational, story-less <b>things</b> to play tinkertoys with. Hmmmm.... I wonder. Could it be that part of the problematic relationship with the fantastic genre in gamer circles has to do with <b>that</b> urge? It's hard to dissect something that insists on wiggling, shifting, being multivalent and full of dueling meanings. But it's hard to have "simple fun" playing tinkertoys with anything that full of meaning and connotation and history. Race and gender and class and power and emotion keep cropping up and spoiling your fun. The only way out of the bind is to assert a cultural hegemony - a one true interpretation - on these symbols so they'll stop wiggling.<br/><br/>Well... there is another way out. Let 'em wiggle. Stop trying to make tinkertoys out of them. Play games that USE that wiggliness instead of fighting it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59637/#Comment_59637" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T11:25:12+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 11:25AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Landon's description of getting his wife into S&amp;S is hella cool, as an off-hand thumbs up.</blockquote>\nGirlfriend, not wife. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And really, I don't see her taking on the genre as a whole, going out and buying a bunch of Conan books or whatever. I'm not sure that she really ended up getting into S&amp;S in general, so much as she found a way to make a statement specifically for our game with those trappings - and not by ignoring them, but using them as an opportunity to say stuff. She could have made her order a mixed gender order. She could have made her character's sister not be a prostitute or her character's twin. She didn't. She went head-on with those issues, hands raised to beat the living crap out of them. She made S&amp;S a cooler genre than it has often been, via her addition to it.<br/><br/>But her example is far from a universal answer to any of the stuff Jasper's bringing up - my only suggestion here is that you give power to the baggage in those genres by merely accepting them, and I think that principle extends into marketing as well as design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59645/#Comment_59645" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T11:39:59+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 11:39AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2007 11:41AM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Pulp &amp; Fantasy are cultural middens full of symbols.

Or at least, not from my part. Yes, I've grown to dislike the geeky lists I mentioned in my last comment, because I think it slows down and interferes with play. But I certainly liked them at one time, and still find a joy in some of those geeky things. I just want to tone them down a bit. And I think it's important to recognize them not as the things we dislike about genre fiction, but as the things we like. Yeah, I like heroic fantasy. And yeah, a lot of other people here don't. But to tell you the truth, I see the same geekiness in some of the other settings described by the people who don't like the D&amp;D approach. Even the settings that aren't theoretically fantasy.

Can you give some examples of what you're talking about, then?  i.e. What are the new activities of the past few decades that you think have broad appeal?

Let's try again. I'll be brief, because I don't really want to type the whole thing again. If I come over as snarky or dismissive because of that, please ask me to elloborate.<br/><br/>About genre: I have a degree in film theory, and I know genre isn't clear-cut. Genre is best thought of as a rough category intuitively shared by audience and artist. My question is, if a large part of the audience intuitively thinks about hurtful attitudes towards women and races, why do we keep returning to those genres?<br/><br/>I know we can use those genre conventions to say something meaningful about race or women's issues, as Landon's excellent post shows. But you don't need those conventions to adress women's issues, and you certainly don't need them to say <i>nothing</i> about them.<br/><br/>(That's the word! Not tropes, or trappings. <i>Conventions</i>!)<br/><br/>Specific example: Maybe the use of "genre" is confusing things, let me give a specific example. Here's what I don't get:<br/>There's been some recent discussion about the depiction of slave girls on the covers of the Conan RPG. My reaction to that was, well, it's Conan. People saying it's true to the source are right. It seems only logical to me that, when you're going to base your game on source material with misogynic imagery, you're going to get people expressing misogenic imagery.<br/>So it seems to me to be a very easy step to say: Let's not make Conan games anymore.<br/><br/>Another example: There's a current thread about racism in Starwars. I'm convinced it's a direct result of Lucas basing Starwars on pulp. It's a direct result of pulp expressing racist attiudes. If that's not what we want, why do we keep basing our stuff on the pulps?<br/><br/>About Trollbabe: I used the game as an example to answer a specific question Joe asked me:\n<blockquote>What if a game were created about fantasy or pulp which took the emphasis off of actions and put it on relationships? Would it de-geekify these genres?</blockquote>\nThe answer is no. Trollbabe has an emphasis on relationships, but I still think it's "geeky". (As does Joe, judging from his later posts.)<br/><br/>About Harry Potter being a children's book: I didn't try to justify it's popularity with it, I was trying to justify the fantasy elements. Fantasy elements are more readily accepted in children's book than they are in adult fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59901/#Comment_59901" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T09:30:12+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  9:30AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jasper Polane</cite>My question is, if a large part of the audience intuitively thinks about hurtful attitudes towards women and races, why do we keep returning to those genres?</blockquote>\nMy question is, do they, in your experience? Because what I've seen more often is continual redefinition, rather than bland acceptance. So, where you're saying that fantasy carries inherently sexist conventions, for example, I see gamers making egalitarian, gleefully un-historical fantasy settings. On the one hand, you could call that lazy handwaving. On the other hand, you could say that fantasy is malleable enough to survive with its other cool parts intact minus those conventions. Or are you trying to talk about a <i>statistical</i> majority here? 'Cause I don't know anything about that, if so.\n<blockquote>So it seems to me to be a very easy step to say: Let's not make Conan games anymore.</blockquote>\nOkay, I dig. But bear with me here, at the risk of having purists come throw things at me: can we make a Conan game without slavegirls in it? Is that element so important to the milieu as to be centrally defining? Or can we make a Conan game where there are oppressed slaveguys too, and crazy sorcerer-queens too? Do we have to just not do Conan? Why are you suggesting a broad prohibition instead of, say, selective revisionism to account for the changed times?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59923/#Comment_59923" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T11:19:46+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 11:19AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also leap to revisionism. <br/><br/>My feeling is I am already taking a gigantic dump all over the source material by creating a campaign and adding player characters to it.

Heck, tinkertoys themselves are quite mainstream.<br/><br/>So I have to conclude that there is broad appeal in concrete, rational, story-less things.</blockquote>\n<i>Among boys.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59950/#Comment_59950" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T12:49:30+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 12:49PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2007 12:51PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Landon said.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, in fact, you insist on defining the genres in question as having these faults, let's make up new genres that have the trappings or whatnot of the old, but not the bad parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, to address the thread more, do people actually play fantasy games because of the sexism or racism, or whathave you. I'm quite sure some do... see FATAL. But I think that, in fact, RPGs have gone out of their way to adjust these genres to the more egalitarian. In Traveller, for instance, it goes out of it's way to point out that the universe in question is post-sexism/racism. Though, obviously "speciesism" still exists to some extent, I think it's presented as allegory to racism in a "what can we do about it?" way. All in a RPG that people have claimed is supposed to be sorta thematically space opera (though, to be honest, most versions are wargames).<br/>\n<br/>\nCan the games themselves be blamed if immature people use them solely as power trips, or as racist escapism? If the game itself is doing nothing to promote that, other than to allow it through not explicitly dissallowing it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean shouldn't we be saying which RPGs are bad about this, and which do well? Instead of condemning entire genres to doom because some games in some genres do bad things? By this reasoning, I'll bet that all genres are "geeky" and "racist" and whatever you want to call them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do *some* of the RPGs go back to these bad tropes and portrayals? Why do TV shows do the same, or books? Because there are racist or simply ignorant people out there making them. There are folks who've never given the fact that the black elves in D&amp;D; are evil a second thought, including, possibly, the guy who invented them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a denial that RPGs can be racist, it's a denial that we adhere to these genres because they're racist. And pointing to the fact that, sometimes they aren't.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why do we like fantasy, to pick one I like? In fact, with both fantasy and sci-fi, there is a belief in the mainstream that all of the material of these genres is purile stuff for kids. This belief comes from the fact that, at one time, this was more true than it is now. Howard's work was published in pulps. Pulp was for kids. Keep this in mind. At the time Howard was writing his stuff he was lauded by nobody. It's only much later that it became something that grown-ups discovered. C.S. Lewis's Narnia books are for kids, explicitly. Moorcock will tell you that not only Lewis, but also Tolkien, are both kiddie stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then he'll tell you that his stuff is not. And one would have to agree, no?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the point. Comic books, fantasy, science fiction that originated in cinema as Flash Gordon episodes shown before the main feature... no matter how actually targeted at adults these things are today, there is still a stigma attached to them from back when they were, in fact, intended for kids, and were, in fact, badly produced for the most part. For every Howard, there were a dozen far, far worse writers. Meaning that no matter your opinion of Howard's work, the general range of quality of the work was miserable. Only a kid could have the lack of standards to swallow this stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis impression of it being for kids has not gone away. Rather, the new impression is that some adults have never grown out of an adolescent adoration of the material, which is what makes them "geeks" to some extent (I don't want to get into that debate again, but here we're meaning that people are calling you something derogatory for enjoying something you love.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question is, have these things evolved beyond pulp? And I think it's quite obvious that they have. I actually think that the depth of Tolkien's work, even thematically, is not so shallow as most think... and that's all ignoring the "geeky" predilection with language, which makes LOTR actually a doctoral level thesis generally acclaimed by linguists worldwide. To say nothing of the fact that it has largely become an American Monomyth that has seeped into a very wide consciousness (and this is before the movies). And Moorcock is still right in that what comes after Tolkien has, at times, startling depth.<br/>\n<br/>\nDune, anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes some fantasy still hearken back to earlier eras and bad habits? Of course. But, again, that's not endemic to the genere. There's better and worse everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more general question, "why fantasy" I'll answer too. To start, we all seem to agree that one can do an engaging story in a fantasy environment. The question becomes, why not just strip off this veneer, drop the "trappings."<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it's not just trappings, in my opinion. I think that, in this day and age, that fantasy exists to allow a discussion of issues that are made more difficult to discuss by modern materialism/rationalism. To put it another way, fantasy allows that magic is real. Whether or not you believe in magic in the real world (and actually that's more likely than one might think), it's still valuable to look at the human condition as though it were real. At the very least, this gives us insight into the nature of the human condition throughout most of history pre-enlightenment. At most it allows us to consider our spiritual side in a petri dish where one can set aside real world religious beliefs for a while to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that's unbelievably important. As important as the speculative part of science fiction, which similarly allows investigations not possible without allowing for the genre marker of "what if." It might not be important to you... but that makes it neither geeky, nor something anyone couldn't appreciate, if they decided to honestly try to understand it (as opposed to lambasting it based on what it once was, or simply on identity politics).<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59960/#Comment_59960" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T13:23:39+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  1:23PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2007 1:27PM by talysman.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Posted By: jhkim</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Posted By: talysman</p>\n<p>I wouldn't say Magic:TG, Pokemon, or WoW have a broad appeal, although they have broken out of a ghetto and even have some mainstream recognition, in the sense that people know what you're talking about.

Can you give some examples of what you're talking about, then?  i.e. What are the new activities of the past few decades that you think have broad appeal?

To be broad, an activity must be generic, covering many different variants. There are lots of card games: poker, Go Fish, hearts, blackjack, and newer collectible card games like M:TG. "Card Games" is a broad activity; individual card games like poker and M:TG, no matter how popular, aren't broad, because they are specific instances of card games. Broad activities are by definition more popular than the specific instances they contain.</p>\n<p>If you were going to define broad purely in terms of popularity and not genericness, I wouldn't consider something as having broad appeal unless the number of people who participated in the activity outnumbered those who didn't.

I'm having a really hard with that one.<br><br>By way of example, there's a folk tale I was referring to, that I've always heard told with a Texan accent, about two snakes meeting in the desert.  And they fight.  And the one snake bites the tail of the other, and don't you know, the other snake bites onto the tail of the one.  So they make this sort of a snakey ring, right?  And neither can let go, because otherwise the other snake'll just eat him, so they both start swallowing, and the ring gets smaller and smaller.  Until, would you believe it, they just plain disappeared!<br><br>Now, you can hunt out metaphor, or something deeply stirring in that, but to my mind, the engagement is a joy about fiddling with a rational system.  At the same time, it seems reasonable that the two snakes can swallow each other, and if so it seems like they oughtta disappear, but we know that can't happen, so...   That strokes the same button for me that elaborate fictional biologies do, albeit in a slightly different way.  That seems to me to be a human level to reach people on.<br><br>In an unrelated way, I can see how Pokemon characters serve the same purposes for the kids who play with them that King Arthur might, but they understand the characters by the mechanical way in which they're presented, rather than as the result of a litany of deeds.  It gives a basis for telling stories about the characters that the participants and audience understand that is different but as valid.

Yes, FRPGs aren't about the actual themes of Tolkien. What was stolen was, in fact, just the trappings of elves, dwarves (note even the Tolkien misspellings here, it's supposed to be elfs and dwarfs). In fact, that pastiche that Ken Hite refers to has created it's own genre.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don't see any of the racism or sexism from the original fantasy materials getting into that genre. The people who have maintained the cockney speaking orcs are, in fact, Games Workshop. Now, that said, and as I mentioned, the Drow elves are unfortunate. And the "kill things and take their stuff" attitude may in some ways be even worse than racism (seems to promote the idea that anybody "other" should simply be killed and/or robbed). The adjustments to female stats is only invented later.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut both are purely accidental, I'm sure. That is, as a wargame, nobody thought that D&amp;D; would be producing theme at all. Making it no more racist than fighting Japanese in a WWII cardboard counter wargame.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have a genre in which some elements that might promote racism slip in here and there. But I don't see it as intentional, or any more of a proclivity of this genre than with any other. Where we see these things coming in most pointedly are when the authors are racist/sexist (FATAL), or where the genre intentionally hearkens back to the actual fantasy genre as it existed pre-Gygax. Ala the Conan RPG (it could be worse, it could be the Gor RPG).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again, I'm not seeing any actual predilection for RPGs to have the genre they specifically portray have anything that is neccessarily racist. Any racism that is there is not due to adopting the Gygaxian fantasy tropes, but brought in from the authors. And it's "accepted" only in that the audience is largely uncritical of the work. That is, if they play Conan, it's not neccessarily because they have slave-girl fantasies, but because they've seen the Conan movies and want to be Ahnold, and kick some ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly I've never known anyone to actually play that RPG. Quality aside, might that be to some extent because the market understands that there are problems with a Conan RPG this way?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, Sorcerer And Sword is Howard with the serial numbers filed off, and it makes no presumptions about what the players will bring to the fantasy world that they create from the genre idea in play. That is, it certainly doesn't do anything to promote sexism or racism - any of that brought into play would be from the players. Moreover, Sorcerer provides a framework where players could bring in Howardsian racism and sexism <i>and deal with it in the sort of revisionist method we're talking about.</i> A lot of sorcerer play tends to be that way, self-condemning of character's flaws.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are undoutedly specific problems of racism in fantasy RPGs. But I'm not seeing any general problem of the genres. Or, in other words, to answer the question "why do we keep coming back to these genres?" the answer is that they are powerful, and don't have to neccessarily be racist or sexist. These genres are defined by something other than these negative elements that sometimes plague them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it's like someone has asked, "Why do you go into the mine if some mines collapse?" Well, because the gold is there, and if we're careful, the mine won't collapse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that gets me about this is that, implicit in the question is an accusation that "geeks" are typically more racist or sexist than other people. That is, one answer to the question would be, "Because it's a place to escape into racist and sexist fantasies that most RPG players have." And I'm not buying that for one minute. Again, most RPG players are white males. Lots of white males are either racist, sexist or both. But I do not think that there is any greater proclivity amongst gamers to be either of these than with any other segment of our society.<br/>\n<br/>\nRPGs are neither a cause, nor a symptom of racism or sexism. They are plagued by these things, but only at the same rate that anything else is. And perhaps a little less. From everything that I've seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60212/#Comment_60212" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T13:38:03+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  1:38PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2007 1:45PM by D-503.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pulp isn't popular in rpgs, people keep thinking it is, but in fact it isn't.

I'm thinking the attraction to these genres<i>to geeky gamers</i>is it's familiarity, or it's trappings as you say.<br><br>Those trappings include misogynic and racist imagery. So why do we keep returning to these genres? If we don't want slavegirls, why do we keep making Conan games? If we don't want insulting depictions of the orient, why do we keep returning to Legend of the 5 Rings? If the most common defense is "these things are just part of the genre", why don't we say "fuck off with your genre?"</br></br></blockquote>\nThey do it in spite of those trappings, or in ignorance of those trappings (mostly in ignorance I suspect).<br><br>In other words, I don't think those racist and sexist trappings, save in a small minority, play any part in the decision to play in those genres.  The genres are chosen because they are escapist fantasies, historically those escapist fantasies had unpleasant trappings attached.  Those seeking them now either discard those trappings (many games do this quite consciously) or are simply unaware that they are offensive, often because when first exposed to them they are too young too know any better and have had little exposure to the groups portrayed in a discriminatory fashion.<br><br>Put another way, I think you are making a logical error.  Game x includes various trappings, Gamer Y plays game x for those trappings, among those trappings are offensive trappings Z.  Therefore, Gamer Y plays in part due to offensive trappings Z.  It just doesn't follow.<br><br>The answer, to the extent one is needed, is simply to educate people about why certain things may be offensive, but that I think is a goal which is both extremely worthwhile and quite unconnected to the hobby.<br><br>In case anyone is wondering, no, I don't play any of these genres especially.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60220/#Comment_60220" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T13:59:44+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  1:59PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Edit:  Also, drow elves have more to do with folklore than racism, folklore which predates the invention of racism as a cultural construct in the modern sense by around a 1000 years or more.</blockquote>\nDrow come very roughly out of folk lore, but the modern D&amp;D image of the drow -- which is what most people who are talking about drow are thinking of -- is based much more on tropes of the dark body that come out of the Orientalist era than they are upon said folk lore.

Pulp Era, Victorian, Post-Apocalyptic, and Space Opera are probably all vying for third place, at a considerable distance from the other two.</p>\nAs a literary genre, sure, but as an rpg genre pulp has a very restricted meaning which has relatively little to do with its meaning in literature.<br/><br/>In rpgs, if you say pulp pretty much everyone expects tommy guns and fedoras, with optional zeppelins.  Pulp rpgs are adventure pulp style games set in the 1920s and 1930s. As you quite rightly put it "What seems to have happened is "pulp" has been redefined to mean "any two-fisted adventure tale set in '20s and '30s", because that's the era when the pulps were big."<br/><br/>And that's true, in rpg terms that is exactly how pulp has been redefined.  I think you're right on why it doesn't sell as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, my point on pulps was simply that the OP is I think mistaken, in that he thinks pulps are a geeky genre popular in rpgs, but in rpg terms pulp is not actually that popular.  Even sword and sorcery, which most gamers would not recognise as pulp, is nowhere near as popular as vanilla (or fat) fantasy rpgs.<br/><br/>However you cut it, pulp just ain't that popular an rpg genre.  If I were investing in a new rpg for financial return (if I were an utter idiot in other words) I would not invest in a sword and sorcery rpg, fat fantasy games sell far better.<br/><br/>Anyway, I need to follow Brand's link to see if I'm wrong about the drow thing, I always figured them for svartalfar but I have to admit I view them as so utterly lame that it's quite possible I've missed other less pleasant connotations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60226/#Comment_60226" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T14:08:19+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  2:08PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>What seems to have happened is "pulp" has been redefined to mean "any two-fisted adventure tale set in '20s and '30s", because that's the era when the pulps were big.</blockquote>\nI think part of the problem is that pulp has been redefined to mean "anything I like about this thing that happened in this area of time/publishing/pop-culture." <br/><br/>If your thing matches up with the thing of others, they like your game.

I think that is their origin. But the modern post-Drizit and Hall of the Spider Queen drow aren't the svartalfar (who were black sometimes and not others, who were elvish sometimes and dwarvish others) have evolved away from their origins. It's the nature of folk lore, it gets reinterpreted with the times. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>I'm not sure the depiction owes much to do with any kind of human ethnic stereotype, frankly if it did I doubt the gamers into them would want to dress up as them.</blockquote>\nSo the question is why we've interpreted it as we have, and why it has such a powerful draw for many people. I mean the svartalfar were never the most popular or important part of Norse myth (not even close), so why have the Drow managed to have such a stamped of popularity now? Why are they so sexy and ninja? <br/><br/>I have a feeling some of it is exotification of the dark body. (I dream of Drowie she's the light brown hair...) I also have an equally strong feeling that is only one component of a more difficult puzzle. For example, I think the adolescent-male cultural obsession with violence in a life that has been ruthlessly purged of violence leads a terrible atavistic thrill in playing a sociopathically violent culture. Then there is the whole aspect of Drow gender relations and sexuality, with female doms having a lure for both men who want that and women who want to be that. <br/><br/>But I'm off topic now.<br/><br/>(Edit: I also find Drow pretty lame. Which is why I'm always surprised when I go to a con or do a survey of D&amp;D fan art to see how into the Drow a lot of folks are.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60231/#Comment_60231" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T14:23:06+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  2:23PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My last post makes me want to make an Awesomeofy The Drow thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60234/#Comment_60234" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T14:29:51+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  2:29PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>My last post makes me want to make an Awesomeofy The Drow thread.</blockquote>\nHow do you mean?

If anything it's a fairly PC genre.  <br/><br/>What these genre have in common is escapism, they are light hearted broad brush genres where you don't have to think too much, and they have ample kewl powerz for the kiddies.  I'm not sure more explanation than that is needed, it's a real stretch to argue that the questionable motifs are part of the attraction.<br/><br/>Isn't it really that the fanbases of rpgs and the fanbases of sf and fantasy genre fiction tend to overlap a bit, with the rpg crowd really being a subset of the fan crowd?

He asked "why do geeky players keep coming back to geeky genres that seem to have such strong associations with questionable motifs?"

I think there was some discussion about the way the orcs in the LotR movies were depicted being racist. To say nothing of the fact that in D&amp;D it's alright to kill them and take their stuff, just because they're orcs.<br/><br/>And for some people, these elements <i>have </i>an appeal. I'm not saying their appeal is in the fact that they're questionable.\n<blockquote>Isn't it really that the fanbases of rpgs and the fanbases of sf and fantasy genre fiction tend to overlap a bit, with the rpg crowd really being a subset of the fan crowd?

That is, I don't think sf and fantasy are escapist.
