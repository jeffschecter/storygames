Please, give a bit of detail as to why it wouldn't work, as I think that this could bevery revealing from a game design perspective. For example:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l289cCZY1aM&amp;feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">Bartender</a> - a japanese anime tv show about a bartender who makes drinks called, "the glass of god." It's not a special drink, but his ability to choose a drink that reflects the drinker's life. Each drink is accompanied by some helpful talk. I love this show because it challenged how I thought stories had to be done, and because it gave me the very sort of respite from the day that the bar in the show offers the characters.<br/><br/>There are four basic roles in Bartender:<br/><br/>- The Drinker. The drinker has a life story that is already preset when the episode begins. The drinker is not necessarily needing to fix their life, but find a respite from which to examine it. That said, the drinker is primarily a passive role, awaiting the gentle advice that the bartender offers.<br/><br/>- The Bartender. The bartender seems the obvious choice for a game, but it isn't. Firstly, for him to do what he does, he must puzzle out his customer, but this is not a step-by-step process, it must be done at the start, as must the choice of drink and accompanying trivia. The bartender does not make a good game because the first thing he does is win, and then the rest of the show is just showing how amazing he was.<br/><br/>- The Secondary Drinker. not in every episode, the secondary drinker just adds a twist to the story, or acts as a distraction<br/><br/>- The Audience. The role of the audience (that is you, the viewer) is, oddly, the real "game player" in the show. The audience tries to figure out the drinker's story before it is announced in the show, which is the best from a challenge standpoint. The audience also progresses, learning drink knowledge and trivia from the bartender, as well as wisdom regarding bartending. While it may seem odd to list the audience, both the bartender and his teacher address the audience directly in the final episode.<br/><br/>From this, I am reminded of a few simple design rules: Games, even rpgs, should not feel resolved at the start, even if the elements from which the story is built are fixed. It is not enough to merely have the players involved in the game, their characters need to be involved, and actively so.<br/><br/>So, what can you think of that you loved watching or reading, but wouldn't make a great game, and why?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196756/#Comment_196756" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T21:46:48+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  9:46PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2009 9:50PM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.theseanachai.com" rel="nofollow">The Seanachai</a><br/><br/>Those short stories by Patrick McLean.

For me, one of the most exciting things about the new games that have come into being over the last five years or so is that they shown us the way to make a game <i>about anything</i>. They've blown open all the assumptions that used to go into writing games. <br/><br/>This is really something that sends my mind spinning, and I love the diversity it's producing.

Like when the camera flies over incredible landscapes, soars over snow-tipped mountains, or through lush rainforest-covered valleys?<br/><br/>There is no narration, no story, no characters. But you just sit there and feel the wonder and awe of creation.<br/><br/>Even better in person, of course.<br/><br/>I find it <i>really</i> hard to envision how to make something like that into a game.<br/><br/>Maybe the documentary film, as a genre, might be one such problematic type of media?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196770/#Comment_196770" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T00:40:08+00:00" title="March 13, 2009 12:40AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Maybe the documentary film, as a genre, might be one such problematic type of media?</blockquote>\nDepends on the type of documentary. Imagine a game where the players are trying to document the rise and fall of an infamous mafia Don without getting themselves greased in the process. Mechanics might cover treading a tightrope between sensationalism and sensitivity. Show people exciting things that the subject of the documentary might not like and you trip towards sensationalism - the audience will love it but the people you're interviewing will be less likely to talk. Go along with the subject's view of things and you risk making your documentary inaccurate and boring, meaning the TV channels won't pay to air it, but at least it'll keep you on the good side of your subject matter.<br/><br/>Maybe more as an interesting scenario for another RPG than an RPG in its own right, but still plenty of mileage I think. Gotta say I agree with your original assessment though. There is nothing that would not make a good RPG given the right rules, there are only poor combinations of setting and rules, and topics that land outside the interests or comfort zone of the individual gamer.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196801/#Comment_196801" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T08:14:10+00:00" title="March 13, 2009  8:14AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2009 8:15AM by Johnstone.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Koyaanisqatsi: The Story Game!<br/><br/>What you need to play: a keyboard with an arpeggiator function.

My example, Bartender, has a concept that is very gameable. Over the Edge (Atlas Games) can make roleplaying a bartender very fun. Star Trek Deep Space 9 also demonstrates patterns that could be used in gaming (not just in the bar, but how the show structures things so the universe comes to the station, rather than having to go out to see the universe). The structure of the <i>Bartender</i> show's stories, however, do not seem so conducive to use in roleplaying games.<br/><br/>That got me wondering, are there other stories that might not work as rpgs, and are there underlying structural elements that make them not work? If so, it might be handy to be able to recognize those hazards and decide if you want to either avoid them or risk them in your own games and adventure designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197377/#Comment_197377" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T08:59:29+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  8:59AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes.

I like Star Trek and Star Wars as universes to roleplaying in. Even though there have been lots of stories in both, the worlds feel open enough to still tell/run/play your group's own story without interferences. On the other hand, while I love Battlestar Galactica and Lord of the Rings I don't want to game in either place. I don't think I'd like to play a story set in those universes. I wouldn't give a crap about some other group of colonists with some other Battlestar. I don't care what the dwarves were doing during the War of the Ring or what anyone was doing before or after. So it's partly about how big and important the mythology of the original story is, but also the scope of the world. Galactica has a big mythology and a relatively small world (of those still living). Lord of the Rings has a big mythology and a good sized world (but after so many imitators, it feels smaller). Star Wars has a big mythology and an even bigger galaxy. Star Trek has small mythology and a big, but quickly-running-out-of-space galaxy.<br/><br/>I think that's why the Serenity game was so successfuly initially. There's lots left to explore there. And then the BSG game comes along with the same system and I haven't seen anyone running/playing it locally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197388/#Comment_197388" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T09:44:56+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  9:44AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always hesitate before making these predictions, I feel like the guy in 1891 that says "Man to fly in something other than a balloon?

Star Wars has a big mythology and an even bigger galaxy. Star Trek has small mythology and a big, but quickly-running-out-of-space galaxy.<br/><br/>I think that's why the Serenity game was so successfuly initially. There's lots left to explore there.

That is to say, I can't see anyone really playing a "Midnight's Children" the RPG and not sucking (not even Rushdie himself). However, every time we play an RPG mindfully we may well have the chance to develop our own voice in play and narration in a way that makes stories where the authorial voice is so important to what is happening that to do without that voice is to do without that story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198456/#Comment_198456" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T18:30:03+00:00" title="March 23, 2009  6:30PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>A Swede is working on something inspired by The Wire.
