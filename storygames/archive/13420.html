Incidentally I tried to convince my ex to play 'Breaking The Ice.'  (In return I had to watch 'Mamma Mia' - the things we do...).  I check the Black and Green site now and again and while more seems to be have been added to the SIS page there is nothing yet to buy.<br/><br/>Has this disappeared into the same development limbo as 'Play Sorcerer'?  I do hope not.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302513/#Comment_302513" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-28T19:09:26+00:00" title="November 28, 2010  7:09PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this game.  It's already good to go for one-shots and short arcs, but I think Emily's still working on making the long-term aspects come out right.  Last time I asked her, she said she didn't want to publish it until it was truly done.  I can certainly sympathize with that!<br/><br/>Let us know how your game goes!  <br/><br/>If you need any advice, feel free to ask, there is some chance that I might be able to help.  Or, ya know, email Emily for the actual answers.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
