It reminds me of Jonathan Janssen's "Paths of the Resolute" entry, actually.<br/><br/>And I'm struck by the elegance and expressiveness of having a protagonist who doesn't talk, thinking back to games like Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and Zelda.  I know that silent protagonists are also a trademark of shooters like Halo, Master Chief being a prime example.  But it makes me wonder about replicating this effect in RPGs, as a way of exploring expressiveness through gestures and description rather than dialogue.<br/><br/>The only thing that readily comes to mind, something from my roleplaying experiences that feels a bit like this, are the "wirework/fight" mechanics from Mist-Robed Gate, which are purely descriptive and tend to be based on physical actions and demeanor rather than words.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332722/#Comment_332722" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T09:45:29+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  9:45AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you could easily get some mileage through simply changing your narration of a character.  Instead of saying stuff in character, you describe his action, and also the thoughts he wants to convey.  Make his every little action convey the complicated thoughts you want to get across, but never do it verbally.  "My guy nods, but in a hesitant fashion.  You can tell he is going to follow the plan, but he is reluctant because of the obvious glaring flaw."<br/><br/>Depending on the game, you could take traits like "Stoic Silence" or "Actions Speak Louder than Words" or "Silence Keeps me A Victim" to get the point across and add mechanical heft to the concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332742/#Comment_332742" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T10:17:40+00:00" title="July  1, 2011 10:17AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I dig that, Nick.  I was thinking more about designing a game or playing a scenario in which the protagonist(s) just didn't speak, but you're right that you could play the silent, stoic badass Batman-type in other games as well, even if the other characters spoke.  It just becomes a personal aesthetic, then, rather than an aesthetic of the entire game.  Really, you could do that with antagonists or other NPCs too, giving them a strange, brooding vibe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332755/#Comment_332755" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T11:19:26+00:00" title="July  1, 2011 11:19AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

One of the two inquisitors introduced himself and the other priest, and did all the talking.  The other priest was described as "like six and a half feet tall" and didn't say anything at all for the entire interrogation scene.  At the end of that scene, all us players were way more worried about the silent father than about the talkative one.  He freaked us out, without really doing anything.<br/><br/>As a bonus, it meant the GM had less talking-between-two-NPCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332760/#Comment_332760" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T11:38:06+00:00" title="July  1, 2011 11:38AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2011 11:42AM by ColinC.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing about Ico, Colossus, Zelda, Metroid, and Halo that helps encourage this kind of play is that, to one degree or another, there aren't many people around to talk to even if you wanted to. Mostly there are environmental threats, puzzles, and anti-social monsters. The setup supports the play style.<br/><br/>Which makes me think one way to do this would be to choose a one-player, one-GM game - for example Beast Hunters or Trollbabe. Then play it with the agreement that most threats/conflicts framed will not involve speaking. Could be an interesting creative constraint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332764/#Comment_332764" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T11:51:46+00:00" title="July  1, 2011 11:51AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Because of the narrative truth rule in that game, players can put words in the mouths of NPCs as well control other cinematic story telling elements like lighting and camera angle.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332788/#Comment_332788" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T13:28:50+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  1:28PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin, you're right-on as far as the solitary playstyle goes.

One of the seven or eight options is Freedom of Thought. Freedom of Thought grants you the right to think freely and radically, but imposes a teensy-tiny restriction on your life: you can never talk again. Talking becomes illegal.<br/><br/>I'd say about 8% of all Perfect characters are mute, maybe more. One thing that's really common is that people invent really clever ways of slipping notes, leaving signs, and developing secret sign languages. But generally, when you take away <i>tell</i>, you get a lot more <i>show</i>: instead of saying that you're an ally, you place a hand on your comrade's shoulder; instead of saying you love someone, you embrace them in a passionate kiss; instead of saying some coyly romantic things, you start leaving roses on doorsteps. It makes for dynamic and interesting scenes.<br/><br/>But of those characters who sign up with the Freedom of Thought, almost every single one has a moment where they "actually speak." I think that's just a gamer tendency. You have a world where all the sorcerers are dead, and someone just <i>has </i>to play "the last sorcerer." You have a mute character, and the player just <i>has </i>to have a moment where they utter their single sentence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan" title="Zachary_Donovan"><img alt="Zachary_Donovan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan">Zachary_Donovan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332827/#Comment_332827" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T18:59:32+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  6:59PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I caught sight of this thread, I immediately went to some variation on <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2006/01/the_court_of_th-2/" rel="nofollow">The Court Of The Empress</a>. The Empress doesn't speak, but conveys her wishes through body language, hand gestures, notes, sounds, whatever, and the courtiers interpret these gestures as best they can. Perhaps you establish a gesture ahead of time for "kill that one."<br/><br/>This, of course, immediately takes me to this game:<br/><br/>One character is Divine - a direct manifestation of holiness on earth. The other characters are holy people who come to interpret the (nonverbal) signs of the Divine. The Divine, of course, seeks to sow peace amongst the holy people, but the holy people interpret the signs of the Divine toward their own ends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
