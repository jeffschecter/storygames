                    I'm curious what is your (anyone's) most loved modification to a pre-existing game or system. What did you do, how did you do it and how did it change or affect the gameplay in a way that playing it the orginal way couldn't? What were the benifits?   What were the drawbacks?    Do you still play it the original way, or do you tend to use the modified version more?   And why?                </div>

                            Huh, these are things I tend to forget with time, so I'll dredge up what I can...<br/><br/><b>Exalted: Stunts Must Rock</b>: For 1st ed Exalted my group made several changes to the stunt rules. First, you got essence/willpower for any stunt, successful or not. Second, you could use a stunt bonus as extra dice, or you could use them to buy off difficulty over the normal (essentially giving auto-successes on tasks that are more difficult than the routine). Third, players were given extensive ability to scene-frame and use director stance (explicitly)  whenever they stunted and whenever describing the results of a big (2 or 3 point) stunt. Finally, players could all vote on how much of a bonus a stunt should get, with low vote taking it. <br/><br/>The overall effect of these changes was more stunts, more distribution of authority over the game via coolness, and more insane and batshit stuff happening. All of these were much desired, especially as I've often felt that anytime in Exalted that there is a die roll it should be a stunt. Screw normal actions. <br/><br/><b>Truth and Justice: Fuck That, I Win</b>: Truth and Justice has an extensive hero point system that lets players tilt the odds in their favor in various ways in exchange for getting screwed in various others. One varient we came up with was burning permanent Max (a big deal in the game) in order to be able to just say "Screw this, I win NOW" -- somewhat influenced by CoS's Doom mechanic. <br/><br/>The result of this in play was subtle, as it only ever happened once. However, knowing that they could do it seemed to give the players some more confidence in the game and after we made the rule they opened up with crazy shit more often, and were willing to have me screw their characters blue more often, as they knew they could always get out of it if things went wrong. <br/><br/><b>Not All Instincts are the Same: Unknown Armies</b>: For using the UA stress meter, rather than having all the characters have the same default reactions to failed stresses (run/beserk/freeze) we let PCs set their failure options for each of the stress bars to something individualized. <br/><br/>The effect in play for this one varied by player. About half the players just went with the default down the line. Those that didn't, however, found all new ways to make their characters go dysfunctional. The guy who laughed himself silly when he failed unnatural notches and the girl who responded to Self by becoming passively obedient to the nearest older woman were particularly interesting. <br/><br/>More common, I think, is when I steal a mechanic from one game to put into another. Trust from CoS has ended up in a lot of games that I play, as have Keys from TSOY.                        </div>

                            My favorite hack: <b>Modified PTA-Style Scene Framing in every game, ever.</b>  When it's your turn, you frame a cool scene, whether about your own character or about some other characters. And when the scene is done, we move to the next player.  If there's a GM, they get to frame a scene when it comes to them, but not before.                        </div>
