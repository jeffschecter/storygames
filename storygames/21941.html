(MC Moves are more general-purpose, and contain a lot of techniques this one does not, but this procedure organizes them in order of importance, and can function as a checklist or flowchart, and has the advantage of simplicity, as well.)<br/><br/>What's your "procedure for play", when you play in a certain style? Is it better expressed as a list of "moves" or as flowchart?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin" title="Aaron_Griffin"><img alt="Aaron_Griffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/469/nQL6632G2O226.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin">Aaron_Griffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480307/#Comment_480307" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-11T14:18:55+00:00" title="February 11, 2019  2:18PM">February 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My GM style is:<br/><br/>* When they ask for something, consider giving it to them.<br/>* If that's too easy, give it to them with strings attached.<br/>* If that's not enough, tell them what it will take to get it.<br/><br/>This goes for information (where the strings attached is "bad news") as well.<br/><br/>Dice come out when they ACT.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480308/#Comment_480308" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-11T14:57:50+00:00" title="February 11, 2019  2:57PM">February 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - Paint a scene.
