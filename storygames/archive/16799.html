I didn't think much of it at first glance, but the more I get into it the more I LOVE how I can customize the heck out the game. The most fun I think will come form building my own classes and powers. But other things like tinking up world based fronts and moves will be extra awesome.<br/><br/>I've got a few to-do's on my list but I'd love some feedback and ideas:<br/><br/>1. New Classes - I'm open to suggestions on classes I should attempt to build. I've got ideas for the following: Artificer, Alchemist, Warlock, Witch, Shadow Dancer, etc. Heck, I might even dream up Monster Classes like Dragon, etc. <b>What do you think? What classes would you like to eventually see?</b><br/><br/>2. System tweeks - It's going to take a while to get my players use to the idea of no initiave in combat. Until I can ween them off of it, I might use a Dex+d6 roll off mechanic. Later down the line I'd love to cook up new Moves for the classes. Like Quick Draw for the Rogue/Ranger, Tactical Leadership for the Fighter, Arcane Alertness for the Wizard, etc, etc. Basically letting the players declare these 'positioning' powers to trigger if/when they go in a combat order. especially if these powers grant unqiue bonues if they roll well. LIke Tactical Leadership allowing the Fighter to 'place' the Rogue in a scene, etc. <b>Thoughts?</b><br/><br/>3. World Emulation to World Building - Right off to bat I'm going to start building Fronts and Moves associated with Eberron. Just as my practice playground. Eventually I want to dream up unique world powers of my own setting. <b>Is there any settings you want to build eventually?</b><br/><br/>A few oddball ideas I have:<br/><br/>Powerful Races get plugged into a class by trading out a primay move of the class for a racial move. Then puting that 'traded out' move into the pool of level 2-5 moves to be picked up. Also, adding more racial moves assoicated with the race to the pool if there are multiple.<br/><br/>An expanded Signature Weapon (gear) move list that enhances the Signature Weapon move of a fighter. (Flaming, Frost, Intellegent, etc.)<br/><br/>Wild Talent Moves for Psionics. Again with the idea of a move swap at 1st level or just adding it to the pool as you level up.<br/><br/>Epic Moves for level 10+ characters. Planar Shifting, Calling upon armies. Etc. Only really used for climax events in a campaign.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear some of your future hacking plans for  Dungeon World.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383455/#Comment_383455" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T14:45:47+00:00" title="June 26, 2012  2:45PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2012 2:47PM by mostlyjoe.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh forgot a few cool ideas:<br/><br/>Plot Paths!

Once a session they get to attempt to change the active plot by invoking this Move. And they either get a Yes: And to a No: And result. Be careful if your Plot Move controls relationships...the next think you know the Duke might be trying to force you to marry his daughter!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383551/#Comment_383551" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T06:31:22+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  6:31AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I LOVE Plot Paths!
