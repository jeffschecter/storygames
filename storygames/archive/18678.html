Still, I'm intrigued at the idea of a diceless hack that is not centered around PVP and plays more like a spy thriller. The setting I came up with follows the show The Americans, where players are KGB spies for the U.S.S.R as illegals in the 1980s. Here's what I was thinking:<br/><br/>You've got Trust, Intel and Heat. All of these are point pools. <br/><br/><b>Trust</b> is the currency of life for a spy. If you\u2019ve got it, you can do anything. Players gain Trust by working assets and living their legend (their cover identity).<br/><b>Intel</b> is simply information. It is only assigned a numerical value when dealing with assets to abstract the amount of actionable intelligence you need to get on an Intel before you advance your relationship with them. The more you know about them, the more you can develop them, get what you need from them. Otherwise, Intel refers information in general. All Intel represents actual information in the fiction.<br/><b>Heat</b> is the point pool that the GM uses to complicate the players lives. When Players have no Trust to spend, or don't want to spend it, they can instead choose to draw Heat (raise the Heat pool by however much it would've cost in Trust). There are also fictional considerations for when Heat might be earned - giving conflicting information to an asset, leaving witnesses to a murder, etc. The more Heat drawn, the more things the GM can do with it (as they use it to "buy" moves) and the less Trust agents can build up in total.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So agents have moves like:</span><br/><br/><i>Blend In</i>: when you develop your legend by fitting in and acting normal as per your identity, earn Trust as per your playbook. <br/><br/><i>Leverage Training</i>: when you leverage your KGB training to do something only a top-notch, international spy could spend 1 Trust and say how you do it. <br/><br/>Use spy craft to detect or spot a tail, figure out if someone is carrying, perform a feed of daring athletics like jumping across rooftops, scaffolding down a roof into a hotel room, take out someone unaware of your presence, etc. You can also use Trust to diffuse situations with marks or other characters if you make them suspicious or to shrug off questions they ask you about yourself; to beat a lie detector test or to just do something quickly that normally couldn\u2019t be rushed.<br/><br/><i>Asses</i>: when you need something about an unknown person or your surroundings to be true, spend Trust to have it be so.<br/><br/><i>Cultivate Asset</i>: when you stalk, use surveillance, look through a mark\u2019s personal effects, cold read or engage a mark in conversation to find out information, you may spend Trust 1 for 1 to:<br/>-Ask a question to gain 1 Intel (something useful about them)<br/>-Put the target at ease <br/>-Avoid unwanted attention<br/><br/><i>Develop Asset</i>: when you need to develop your asset and progress your relationship with them by using what you know about them, spend Intel to raise their Asset Status. For every point of Intel you spend, the Asset will ask you a question about yourself.<br/><br/><i>Crash Asset</i>: when you have no time to gradually develop an asset and need to get information out your mark right away, say how you get the information from them, the GM will tell you how much Intel (Blackmail) or Trust (Bluff, Intimidate, Seduce) you need to spend.<br/><br/><i>Dead Drop</i>: when you need resources to carry out your task, say how you contact your people and where you go to get what you need. Spend 1 Trust per object to have it be there waiting for you.<br/><br/><i>Take Down</i>: when you need to take someone down, say the first thing you do to take them out and spend Trust. Some enemies are tougher than others and will require more than 1 point of Trust to be spent. In general, as a seasoned operative, the amount of Trust you can expect to spend is as follows:<br/>-Civilian (1)<br/>-Security guard, beat cop (2)<br/>-Trained security, SWAT (3)<br/>-Trained operative, CIA, FBI (4)<br/>-Better than you, Black ops (5)<br/>If you don\u2019t know how much to spend you must spend Trust blindly, spending enough to hit their threshold means narrating and determining the fate of your opponent. If you spend too little, the GM will either tell you or give you a choice between drawing Heat or taking Harm. <br/><br/>If you are fighting another PC, you must spend Trust blindly in a bidding war. Whoever spends the most Trust gets to narrate and determine the fate of the other. A tie means the fight ends in a draw or a player can choose to start another bidding war. Keep in mind that once you take down an opponent there is still a body to deal with, found bodies draw Heat and dead bodies draw even more depending on if they who did it, if they\u2019re a civilian, law enforcement, public official, etc. <br/><br/><i>Escape and Evasion (E&amp;E)</i>: when you need to get yourself out of a sticky situation, say how you get yourself out of it and spend Trust to:<br/>-Draw no extra Heat then you have already<br/>-Not run into an even worse situation<br/><br/><i>Rendezvous</i>: when you need information or answers from your people, say how you signal your handler and where you meet. Spend 1 Trust for every question you ask. Note: even if your handler signals you and gives you information or an assignment, you must always spend 1 Trust to ask additional questions. Inquisitiveness is not a beloved quality in Moscow.<br/><br/><i>Interrogate</i>: when you extract the information you need from a target, say how you do it and ask your questions. Spend 1 Trust for every answer you want to be sure is answered truthfully. If they\u2019re trained to resist interrogation the GM has the option of giving false information. The GM will tell you how much Heat you draw depending on:<br/>-What you do with them afterward <br/>-What they learn about you<br/><br/><i>Rest and Recover</i>: when you need to recover from Harm that has been inflicted on you, you must first make sure you have the proper equipment to do so (1 Harm requires a first aid kit, 2 Harm requires medication and supplies, 3 Harm requires another person with medical expertise to assist.) Spent Trust to acquire what you need, spend 1 point of Trust for every Harm you have to make do with what you have immediately available to treat yourself. There will be complications when you try to Blend In. (All agents can take up to 4 harm).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419497/#Comment_419497" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T21:37:59+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  9:37PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">And playbooks might look something like, Wilderness of Mirrors-y:</span><br/><br/><b>The Shop Owner/Scalphunter</b><br/><i>Blend In</i>: for every week you keep regular hours at your business and stick to your regular routine, you earn 8 Trust.<br/><i>Reputable Establishment</i>: you own a small store, shop, restaurant or business of some kind.

Any Asset you have at this stage earns you 2 Trust whenever you visit them. You need at least 2 Intel to progress the asset to a acquired one.<br/><br/>Acquired Asset: this is the stage where you build trust, learn their vulnerabilities, solve any interpersonal problems and form a strong relationship. Any Asset you have at this stage earns you 3 Trust whenever you visit them. You need at least 3 Intel to progress the asset to a developed one.<br/><br/>Developed Asset: this is the stage where you begin to establish habits as innocently as possible by requesting information, also usually done in small steps. First, asking for documents readily available and open to the public. Then, technically restricted, but harmless files such as phone logs or some such thing and then, after that, technically classified documents but all the while accompanied with plausible explanations or as favors. Any Asset at this stage earns you 4 Trust whenever you visit them. You need at least 4 Intel to progress the asset to a recruited one. You can get minor favors from a developed asset.<br/><br/>Recruited Asset: after they've turned over enough information, they are gradually compromised until they have no choice but to work as an agent. Money is offered under pretenses of paying for expenses, having the asset travel to obscure places and unusual times to meet and documentation and evidence to establish their compromised nature for blackmail are put in place. Once this proof is secured, the direct recruitment takes place and, depending on the situation, it usually involves blackmail or, if they\u2019re sympathetic to the cause, playing up that angle, usually along with money. Any Asset at this stage earns you no further Trust because they are essentially an Agent and can only draw Heat from then on as they are no longer innocent. You can get major favors from a recruited asset.<br/><br/><br/>Minor favors are can be used to acquire technically classified documents but those that can\u2019t be seen as harmful. They\u2019re easily to access and though the asset could get in trouble or fired for providing the information (for sure if they learn where the information Is going), it doesn\u2019t appear threatening or as a betrayal to their country in the mind of the asset. A minor favor can equal 3 Intel if used to acquire or develop an asset.<br/><br/>Major favors are ones that are traitorous and dangerous. There is no explaining them away and deals with difficult to get ahold of, classified information that would mean the death penalty for giving away to the enemy. A major favor can equal 5 Intel if used to acquire or develop an asset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419499/#Comment_419499" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T21:38:25+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  9:38PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">GM Moves look like</span><br/><br/>Use Heat to: <br/><br/>\u2022 Introduce an enemy without warning (1 Heat for every two points of Trust the player must spend to take them down.)<br/><br/>If you ever want to throw an agent into a fight and not give them a heads up with a soft move to show signs of an imminent threat, you can spend Heat to do that. Have a garrote wire suddenly loop around their neck, a security guard grow suspicious and draw his gun and ask the agent what they do.<br/><br/>\u2022 Have an asset ask a player a question (1 point)<br/><br/>Questions from assets are dangerous for agents. If an agent is smart, they\u2019ll have a cover identity they use with an asset, probably a different one for each asset. When an asset asks a question, it means they remember the answer, and the GM should jot it down. If at any time any of the information an agent gives the asset contradicts previously given or known information or just seems unbelievable or weird in the first place, you may threaten the relationship for free.<br/><br/>\u2022 Make a hard move (3 points) (Common hard moves like you'd find in Dungeon World, etc.)<br/><br/>Use this to make a hard move without having to make a soft move first.<br/><br/>\u2022 Threaten a relationship with an Asset (5 points)<br/><br/>Have an asset complain or make demands on the agent or just put pressure of some kind on them. Maybe the asset wants to get married, or have him get rid of her ex-boyfriend for her. When you spend points to do this it always means that the demands are such that if the player does not meet them, their Asset status goes down one level. If they were only just in the door with the asset, the asset no longer wants anything to do with them and the agent will have to be particularly clever to get back in.<br/><br/>\u2022 Take away an asset (10 points)<br/><br/>This usually means that the asset is either killed or turned double on the agent, whether they know it or not. Maybe they just disappear, or their handler thinks they\u2019re getting too attached so they get rid of them. This skips the step of threatening the relationship and jumps straight to death of the relationship in some way.<br/><br/>\u2022 Blow a cover identity (15 points)<br/><br/>Let the agent know in some way that a cover identity is blown. Have them see a wanted poster or a TV broadcast or maybe another asset spots them and wonders why they\u2019re with another woman and why they look different.<br/><br/>\u2022 Compromise a line of communication (15  points)<br/><br/>Let the agents know they must have a leak somehow by putting law enforcement, or a rival a step ahead of them. Keep them a step in front of the agents until they figure out the compromise. Maybe their handler was turned, maybe the code they use was cracked, or the dead drop or signals used compromised. Maybe there\u2019s a bug somewhere or they\u2019ve got a tail. Know how you\u2019re compromising an agent, or agents, as they\u2019ll want to plug it back up.<br/><br/>\u2022 Have them kidnapped and interrogated (20 points)<br/><br/>This could be any faction \u2013 the U.S.S.R testing their operative to see if they've gone soft or if they have a mole, the FBI getting some Intel or a lucky break and taking you down before you know what happens. If put in this situation, an agent must spend a point of Trust, give up a point of Intel, or draw a point of Heat per question they do not wish to answer (you can\u2019t keep asking the same question).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419582/#Comment_419582" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-05T09:10:26+00:00" title="August  5, 2013  9:10AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2013 9:10AM by Paul_Riddle.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Attention <a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/kksimons">@kksimons</a> - comments:<br/><br/>A general comment: try to really condense the number of basic moves. It seems like there's a fair amount of move overlap and adjacency. I would expand the scope of leverage your spy training (get rid of the word leverage and replace it with a better trigger) to encompass their general spy activity and then maybe get rid of  some of the specific cases. Also, the void that isn't covered by the moves is just as important as what the moves themselves cover. Use the void to shape play - like interrogate, maybe they can't just make it happen. If they don't cooperate in the fiction, then what do you do? Do you do something nasty or do you just move on? Something to think about.<br/><br/>Maybe get rid of the playbook construct all together? I kept the playbooks in Undying for a specific reason; but, for the Regiment, which is also an AW hack, John and I are thinking of getting rid of them. Here, it seems that the playbooks are a way for the game designer to enforce a specific cover story on the character. Maybe you don't really need to? Then, you can focus your energy on the basic moves, which will be used 90% of the time anyway.<br/><br/>Since you're using Undying as a starting point, here are some thoughts on how you can better leverage the game's existing machinery. If you want to go your own way, totally go for it!<br/><br/>Heat seems like it ties the GM's hands and, in many ways, also seems like negative trust. Recommend making heat a thing that is an attribute of the character. Let the GM run the world as established. Still give the GM those GM moves; but maybe group them according to the character's heat level. If you use the humanity mechanic from Undying for heat, then you can make the player choose more uncomfortable choices when making some of your moves that sets the GM up for hard moves. It probably makes sense for the other players to vote on this one. If they get too much heat, that's probably when they are exposed and killed/captured.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you could absolutely use heat like blood in Undying. Example: "Take heat 1-for-1 to...". When they hit their heat maximum, they get in real trouble. When they cool off, they spend their heat. Lower heat is better and if you can increase the size of your heat pool, then you have more breathing room.<br/><br/>Trust seems more like debt from Undying, rather than blood. If you use the debt mechanic, then trust is a thing you have with individual people, rather than a thing you have in general. That seems like a more compelling asset-building mechanic.<br/><br/>What is intel supposed to do as a mechanic? Maybe the thing to figure out is, how are the characters motivated through the mechanics to expose themselves to danger to collect intel and what happens to them when they get it. I would think that accomplishing some intel gathering or disrupting some enemy activity is the objective of the mission and that the long term character goal is to get the job done and exfiltrate. Maybe you treat intel like the status mechanic in Undying, where the object is to get to "Liege." Maybe when they get there, they can finally go home: retire their character to safety? You could have levels that vary from knowing only rumors and innuendo to uncovering the grand conspiracy. It probably makes sense for the GM to decide on this one.<br/><br/>It feels like the passage of time move should come in somewhere in this game to jump between assignments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419605/#Comment_419605" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-05T15:30:13+00:00" title="August  5, 2013  3:30PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2013 3:33PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

I'll take all of that into consideration, lots of really great ideas. Some of my thoughts on what's going on behind the scenes. I'm not sure if you've watched the TV show called The Americans but I'm leaning more towards that, where they're in it for the long haul. The only reason they'd retire or go back to Russia is if they were blown. <br/><br/>I wanted the main goal for Intel to be for characters to try and have some real conversations with actual people and to explore that a bit, but using spy techniques to give them a leg up. So they'd gather Intel on a mark before approaching, or perhaps used cold reading to wing it, but they'd ask questions and as they hit on the points that are important to that person, the GM would give them a point of Intel for the relevant stuff. So if they broke into the mark's house and found that they had an online dating profile, or were in massive debt, or was divorced with a kid, they could use that develop the asset. Once they had enough of that kind of info, they'd hit upon those points in conversation with the mark to develop them. The benefit from developing the mark would be twofold, in that they get Trust for developing assets and cover identities and that once the relationship has progressed enough they can start asking for favors to get information the asset has access to. I want asset building to be a big part of the game. Developing long-term or short-term ones depending on the mission. I've always liked the idea of Cold War spies and old-school trade craft along focusing mainly on developing asset building. <br/><br/>Trust is probably just a bad name for the idea I was going for. Mainly something like "Cover" or something. I was thinking of it as the ability for a spy to do the things they do while going unnoticed and unhindered. So they could spend it to be a badass, counter a soft move, etc. If they run out of it, they can instead draw Heat, which allows the GM to make some moves.<br/><br/>I think you're probably right about Heat, making an attribute could make things a lot easier. I liked the concept for Heat in that it really did tie the hands of the GM a bit, right? So players are going to be really, really competent a lot of the time until they get some Heat - and they choose when that happens. Until then, they're succeeding and narrating everything they do. Which feels very Bond/Jason Bourne to me, so I liked the idea of the mix and that's where I was coming from.<br/><br/>Playbooks too I think you're right about, they aren't very necessary. Maybe just having characters pick their legend and maybe one thing they're awesome at?<br/><br/>The moves definitely need work, I'm going to retool them!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a> - that sounds awesome! At least I know that if this doesn't work out I'll have something awesome to play regardless!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419613/#Comment_419613" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-05T19:44:04+00:00" title="August  5, 2013  7:44PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't seen that show; but, in that context, what you're going for makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>I think it would be interesting to design a mechanic that really taps into their core motivation for espionage. If it's not to get the job done and get out, it's gotta be something: patriotism, revenge, excitement.<br/><br/>Cover is a lot better than trust.<br/><br/>Maybe for the asset development, the moves start when they have leverage over their mark. Leave the how they get the leverage out of the move space and in the void. That way, you neither constrain their approach nor give them a straight point buy. Once they have leverage, give them a move or moves to work them over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419620/#Comment_419620" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-05T23:52:36+00:00" title="August  5, 2013 11:52PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's such a better way to go about it, thanks! A leverage move makes way more sense and is really elegant.<br/><br/>As for motivation, I was thinking of building that into the playbooks but that means a very specific play experience. One of the things I love about the TV show is that they're half in it for patriotism and or their country, part for the children they have together (two agents came to states, got married and started a family as a cover to fit in but the family is more than that), and part for each other, as they're a duo that are trying to figure out their relationship too as it was a marriage of convenience and cover for their KGB identities but everything gets mixed up.<br/><br/>Obviously all that would be hard to simulate, but that's where I was going with the playbooks that had both a cover and a thing they were particularly good at. Not sure of the best way to go about it though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419635/#Comment_419635" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T07:08:27+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  7:08AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2013 7:09AM by Paul_Riddle.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess that depends on what you want the people at the table to experience. If you want them to have that very specific experience: a russian spy couple raising a family in the states, then that's exactly what your game should be about. You don't have to solve the general problem if you have a special case in mind. In that instance, maybe you have mom, dad, son, and daughter playbooks and you focus your game on how this very abnormal family tries to be normal?<br/><br/>Pulling that string a little further, maybe there are no basic moves. Maybe you just have these four playbooks and they give each of the players strong roles that overlap at the corners a bit. Mom and dad both have spy and parenting moves. Son and Daughter both have kid/growing up moves. Dad and son, mom and daughter maybe share a gendered move. Similarly with the Father/daughter, mother/son relationships.<br/><br/>Write down a couple of concise, unambiguous statements of what you want your game to be about (i.e. who the characters are and what do they do) and what the people at the table are meant to experience through game play. Go from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419944/#Comment_419944" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T14:50:35+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  2:50PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A while ago, I was working on an AW hack about under cover operations behind enemy lines that seems to cover a lot of the same ground as this.
