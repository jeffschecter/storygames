Reading the LB PDF got me excited about running it, but I'm it's going to be a bit outside my comfort zone, so I'm probably over thinking things, but still, I have some questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main one seems to be about how much the players should know before we start playing.  I haven't had a chance to ask if any of them have seen LB before.  But I'm wondering if it's important to have players not know about the other player's characters or if people generally have everyone know about other people's keys and secrets and so on.  Some of the play reports I've read seem to indicate that people were replaying or were familiar with the details before they started, so maybe that's an indication that most people don't worry about secrecy?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I'm pretty excited about this even though I've not run a game which was so collaborative before, but I'm hoping I'll be able to pull it off.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone" title="Dr_Stone"><img alt="Dr_Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone">Dr_Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368946/#Comment_368946" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T05:38:19+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  5:38AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and kind of related, I'm going to have 4 people, so knowing how much to share with people might help with choosing characters.

So whatever your players don't care about will naturally fall away, like onion skin. The game runs fine if no one picks up on all the implied plot threads.<br/><br/>I've played LB with a fair amount of new groups, and I usually read the intro text (the short, pulp-fiction-esque section on the front page) in as melodramatic a fashion as possible, then throw the character sheets down on the table and let the players sort through them.<br/><br/>When everyone has chosen a character, I ask the crew players to sit on one side of the table and give them the Owl sheet to share. Then jump right into the action. <br/><br/>I don't bust out the map of the universe until they break out of jail and escape the Hand of Sorrow. By that time they've figured out what's up and what they want to do, and are ready to hear more about the setting. <br/><br/><b>You will have fun.</b> It's a great game. Just watch the players. If they are riffing, follow their lead. If they are stalled, throw something at them to fight, chase or run from (space squid, pirates, Imperial Sky Marines, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368955/#Comment_368955" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T06:43:03+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  6:43AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had read the whole game text before my first game.

Everyone knew as players what every character was, no secrets there. It let us play to each others' keys and stuff and help set people up for drama ("Oh, I see where you're going with this, you're getting to your key there. I'll help narrate us in that direction" sort of stuff). <br/><br/>One thing I'd say was helpful to us was to determine if Vance knows Lady Blackbird's real identity. Maybe it's written into the sheets and we missed it, but it changed the dynamic a bit I think for us to have Lady Blackbird hiding her identity from the crew. This was easier for us since Lady B and Naomi were the characters that weren't chosen, but something to think about.<br/><br/>But really, it works any way you play it. As Brian said, you'll have fun regardless.

I'm getting excited.  (It took since I started this thread to find a time when there was a break in the other campaigns, but that's totally an awesome problem to have... :-)<br/><br/>Anyway, rereading the game to get ready I realized that I still have a question or two.<br/><br/>First, can flashback refreshment scenes happen during another scene?  That is, they're in a big battle and things are looking dire and dice pools are low.  Under one interpretation of the rules, Kale might turns to Vance and say, "Captain, this reminds me of the time when we were in that bar fight in the 'Cork and Bottle' on Darkstone?"  "You mean when I picked that fight with the platoon of Imperial Sky Marines?..."  And then they play out the flashback and come back to the current battle with refreshed dice pools.<br/><br/>Does anyone play that way?  It seems like it might be too powerful or might take away from the tension of the battle, but I could see the rules implying it's possible.<br/><br/>Another question was about sorcery.  Lady Blackbird wants to use sorcery to summon a gust of wind to knock the soldier patrolling the deck off the edge.  She rolls 1 die, + 1 for Master Sorcerer, + one for each of Spellcaster, Channeling, Stormblood, and Wind.  That's a total of 6 dice (plus any from her pool).<br/><br/>Now let's say that she wants to call rain down from the sky.  That's not wind-based and not lightning-based.  Does that mean that she would need an advance to get a new tag (say for Water) or would she be able to do it with just the 5 dice from the other tags and such?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone" title="Dr_Stone"><img alt="Dr_Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone">Dr_Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385572/#Comment_385572" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-22T06:06:53+00:00" title="July 22, 2012  6:06AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I guess another question about refreshment scenes.  In the example I gave (bar fight) I presume that they'd get to narrate basically whatever they want without rolling, right?  I suppose a non-flashback refreshment scene might involve rolling, depending on what happens, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385573/#Comment_385573" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-22T06:43:39+00:00" title="July 22, 2012  6:43AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure as heck not an authority, but the way I'd field these would be that flashback-type refreshment scenes can function as interrupts, but they need to be obviously relevant to the moment. I wouldn't put a present-time refreshment scene inside another scene. IT might seem a little over-power-y, but I doubt the players would try it every time they get in over their head. Alternatively, if players catch a great moment for a flashback refreshment scene in another scene but you don't want their dice full quite yet, maybe rule that they play the scene and get their dice back up at the end of the scene when they've got a minute to catch their breath. As for dice-rolling, I've never seen a case of needing dice for a refreshment scene. So many of the present-time ones simply take the shape of conversations for us that it's never been needed. If it's not too much, I'd just say give them their rolls in their refreshment scene - if it's such a conflict that they must roll, it probably isn't all that refreshing for the characters. Plus there would be nothing to keep them from blowing their whole pool on it, since they'd get it refreshed pretty much right afterward.<br/><br/>As with sorcery, I'd absolutely say that she can cast Water spells without a water tag - she's just less good at them. Honestly, by the rules I think she could try to pull off, like, a rock spell, she'd just only get 1+Master Sorcerer+Spellcaster+Channeling (though I'd likely make the difficulty slightly tougher for opposing elements, but that's not rules-based). The spell tags she has are what she's good at, not a limiter on what you can do. That's the beauty of it, you can take a stab at any action and go for it, pretty much no limitations (except some characters can't typically cast spells), you just don't get very many dice out of your traits and tags if you don't play to your strengths.<br/><br/>Hope that helps at all, looking forward to hearing how this actually goes. In truth, don't bother yourself with the little things - play what's cool and fun when it happens. Lady Blackbird essentially runs itself, in my experience. Hope to hear how your game goes, enjoy it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385578/#Comment_385578" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-22T10:50:29+00:00" title="July 22, 2012 10:50AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Refreshes - I've heard people use them both ways.

There were some things I found challenging and I figured I\u2019d try to write some of them down to see what people think.  Since everyone said they had fun, I\u2019m not super worried about these issues, but since a different group of friends asked to play LB on Friday, I figure that soliciting some advice might help advance my skills and make the experience even more awesome for them.<br/><br/>The first issue was pacing.  This came up in a few ways.  We took three sessions to get through the game, probably somewhere around 12 to 15 hours total across three separate Sundays.  That\u2019s obviously much slower than a lot of people play it and while that\u2019s not necessarily bad, for this next group, 15 hours might take three months instead of three weeks, so picking up the pace might be really nice so that the regular game isn\u2019t delayed for more than one or two sessions.<br/><br/>We spent almost all of the first session on the Hand of Sorrow.  They had a lot of fun escaping the brig and then sabotaging the Hand of Sorrow, and then fighting their way to the Owl for their escape, so even though we were going slow it wasn\u2019t because we were bored and nothing was happening.  In the second session, I tried to pick up the pace, but it felt to me like I also lost some of the engagement.  I\u2019m not sure how to cover more plot ground but still keep it engaging and fun.  How do others do this?  Or do you just have fewer events and obstacles if you want to move faster?<br/><br/>Another issue I had was deciding how much one die roll covers.  Sometimes I think it worked well.  After a longish combat near the brig, they enter the machine room where they intend to sabotage the generators somehow.  There are people in there, but rather than drawing out the combat, when Snargle says he rushes in like a screaming daredevil with just his teeth and claws, and then his roll turns out really well, I decide that that means that the sailors are just mooks and he scares the crap out of them and they flee.  But other times, they throw a lot of dice at an obstacle like a sky squid and basically circumvent a potentially interesting obstacle kind of easily.  So, I guess I get how to get a potentially boring obstacle over quick, but I\u2019m not sure how to generate drama around major obstacles when someone can throw 10 dice at it and just blow the first roll out of the water.  Maybe I was allowing refresh scenes too often?<br/><br/>Then there was the ending.  They arrive at the pirate\u2019s fortress in the Remnants towards the end of session 2.  I think that they were expecting me to provide an ending like I probably would in a less story-oriented game, but it wasn\u2019t really clear where to go.  If we\u2019d just said that Lady Blackbird lives happily ever after with Flint, then it felt like it would be kind of anticlimactic, partly because the last few obstacles didn\u2019t really generate enough drama to make a good climax.  For example, the sneaking of the Owl past the Hand of Sorrow and the Sky Squid wasn\u2019t really very dramatic because the awesome piloting roll really didn\u2019t seem to leave room for much beyond success.  Then when Vance confronted Flint in private and asked him what his intentions were towards the Lady, I realized that I didn\u2019t know and we called an end to session 2 to give me a chance to think about it.<br/><br/>By the next session, I decided that Flint was insulted by being challenged, and challenged Vance to a public duel.  This is where Vance\u2019s player really stepped up.  He both came up with a cool resolution to the duel (making a dramatic speech to the onlookers concluding with, \u201cAnd now I\u2019ll banish you to the pits of hell!\u201d before tackling him and using his Voidblood to teleport him into the Wild Blue to (presumably) fall to his death.  And then while the pirates were starting to jockey to fill the power vacuum Vance and Lady B have an extended scene where he declares his love to her and tells her that if she\u2019ll stay with him, he\u2019ll not only be devoted to her, he\u2019ll take over the pirates and redirect them into a full-scale rebellion against the empire with the goal of ending it\u2019s oppressive regime, ending slavery, and making the Wild Blue a better place.  And then, Vance makes an awesome and convincing speech to the pirates laying out his plan and how it\u2019s to their benefit to follow him and to their detriment to cross him.  He makes an excellent roll, so I figure that he was convincing enough that he will get enough followers and a chance to produce some results before any serious treachery gets organized against him and we call it a game.<br/><br/>So, on the one hand, I really like the ending we ended up with, but on the other hand, it felt like we spent quite a while flailing around searching for a way to end the story.  I\u2019ve been pondering what I might do next time to avoid the flailing.  Another thread was talking about asking questions like \u201cHow does your character feel about that?\u201d and similar and I\u2019m wondering if maybe I wasn\u2019t asking enough of those questions so we didn\u2019t get to know the characters\u2019 motivations until too late.  Also, knowing more about who Flint is will probably help since at least knowing what he wants will probably help avoid me being stumped about how he reacts.  Any other ideas?<br/><br/><br/>Wow.  This post ended up being long.  Sorry about that.  When I sat down to write it, I guess I realized I had more to say that I thought.  And thanks for all the advice so far.  This really was a fun game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387138/#Comment_387138" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-15T00:13:38+00:00" title="August 15, 2012 12:13AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the play report, I liked reading what happened in your game, and I'm curious about how your pacing and direction issues will be addressed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone" title="Dr_Stone"><img alt="Dr_Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone">Dr_Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389618/#Comment_389618" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T06:23:11+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  6:23AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, last week I did the first session with the second group.  Pacing was a bit faster, but I think it was mostly because they did less, not because I changed the way we were playing.<br/><br/>Rereading my thoughts from last time, I'm thinking that I'm going to start off this next session (later today) by focusing on reactions to last time.  Vance did some surprising and confusing stuff while trying to get a navigator, and ended up basically kidnapping one.  So, asking the characters what they think of that might help define who they are (and/or spark a mutiny... :-).<br/><br/>We'll see how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
