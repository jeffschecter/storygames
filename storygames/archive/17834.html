Further, every resultant is clearly traceable in its components, because these are homogeneous and commensurable.

Relationships between the characters are a great example. When play begins, we might have a few ideas about how the characters will interact, but that develops into a rich and complex thing over the course of play. But that's not the fruitful void.<br/><br/>There can also be emergent things that aren't fruitful. For example, maybe we gradually find out over the course of play that certain mechanical or narrative interactions are really not fun. Say we find a certain loophole using a specific combination of rules that makes conflicts impossible or instantly over. That's emergent but not fruitful.<br/><br/>The fruitful void is definitely something that is emergent, in that you can't instantly tell what it's going to be like by looking at the rules. You have to play to see how it works and explore it. But it's a pretty specific thing. It's the core of the game, but there's no specific mechanics about it. Morality in Dogs in the Vineyard is a classic example. There's no part of the rules that tells you if your character is a good person or not, of if they've made decisions that are correct. In fact, the rules specifically instruct the GM to NOT make judgments about the character's actions. Instead, the game is about the players and PCs deciding for themselves what the moral course of action is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403607/#Comment_403607" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-13T12:31:36+00:00" title="January 13, 2013 12:31PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs is *such* a good example that it's almost too good.

All the players can go in attempting to "play nice" but colonialism will chip away at you and lead to terrible things. That happens all in a single session, so the fruitful void doesn't necessarily have to be a long-term thing.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is about building a real community out of a bunch of fucknuts and whackos in the middle of a post-apocalyptic wasteland. None of the moves really let you create community and build trust, except maybe the advanced moves. Instead, all the moves are about things tangential to it that show how complicated and difficult it is. And maybe you end the game without a real community being built, that's totally possible to find out: these fuckers won't get it together.<br/><br/>Silver &amp; White is about "what is going on and what does it mean for you." The entire core of the game is a fruitful void. It might be the best example of a fruitful void that currently exists, actually, even more than Dogs.<br/><br/>That said, not all games have fruitful voids at their core. Some of them are structured with more "on the nose" mechanics and guidelines at their center. Keys in TSOY. Beliefs &amp; goals in Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard. The relationship mechanics and questions at the core of Bliss Stage. The various stats in My Life With Master. Having a fruitful void is not the only way to structure these kinds of games. There are still many other emergent things that are powerful and interesting to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404100/#Comment_404100" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T04:27:32+00:00" title="January 20, 2013  4:27AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2013 4:29AM by Rickard.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think these concepts are related, but pretty different!<br/><br/>There are many things that are emergent in roleplaying that aren't the "fruitful void."

I've never seen "fruitful" as "fun", but as "working". If you get the players to explore the void, the system is working. That's fruitful.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Lets take this from another perspective. I just made this argument on another forum.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/void.gif"/><br/><br/>Imagine this is a picture that explains Big Brother. All the arrows are people in the house and the rules of the house. The program is about exploring the void between the characters. They don't say "sleep with each other", "get on each other nerves", "fight". The house rules even say "don't fight". By having the characters, you can explore the void between them. When that happens, it gets fruitful.<br/><br/>If I would explain this from an emergent perspective: when all the parts in the system (the people in a closed space) interact, emergence will happen. So, in other words - I used emergent theory to explain the arrows in Dogs in the Vineyard. I used other words; to explain from another perspective; the same thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404113/#Comment_404113" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T09:07:21+00:00" title="January 20, 2013  9:07AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2013 9:08AM by DWeird.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A game can have emergence that doesn't work (trivial).<br/><br/>Fruitful void is the same thing as emergence that works (uncontested).<br/><br/>Therefore, emergence and fruitful void are not the same (straightforward).<br/><br/><br/>Unless you're willing to claim that all emergence is working emergence, and such things like "damn, my damage rules make players avoid combat instead of being daring swashbucklers like I need them to" are not in fact a problem of emergence that doesn't work, then this whole equal/unequal discussion should be pretty much done.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that this isn't an interesting topic or wrong in its basic thrust.

Digital computers producing interesting art; the idea of 'defensive' or 'offensive' chess play.  To a lesser degree, the way that it can become more sensible to talk about a Lego construction as 'a castle'.<br/><br/>Chess is interesting because there is no space "between the rules" - you can play chess online, using only chess moves to communicate with your opponent, and still 'strategy' comes into existence.  The only legitimate things to do in chess are fully described by its mechanics.<br/><br/>I understand the fruitful void to be about leaving an area of gameplay free-form, more or less.<br/><br/>Role-playing games are an interesting bird because much of the game's state is not quantitatively encoded.  Vague, qualitative ideas such as "your car is going quickly" can influence the quantitative ones, such as how many hit points damage you take when you crash.<br/><br/>Entirely qualitative elements can interact - like, how is the cop's mood affected when he sees you whizzing by in your stolen vehicle?  So, one way to look at the void is that it's a primary source of game state.<br/><br/>I guess the cop's mood "emerges from the void", but this feels like a different meaning of emerge than I was using above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404121/#Comment_404121" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T11:04:50+00:00" title="January 20, 2013 11:04AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Which is not to say that this isn't an interesting topic or wrong in its basic thrust.

I feel that a lot of folks doesn't get fruitful void and tries to explain it through the words of others. I think <b>Deliverator</b> hits the nail when asking about any other game except Dogs that is a good example of fruitful void. I also believe Baker made up a term for something already existing.<br/><br/>(Or it's just me who thinks it means something else, but that's why I started this discussion.)\n<blockquote>Unless you're willing to claim that all emergence is working emergence, and such things like "damn, my damage rules make players avoid combat instead of being daring swashbucklers like I need them to" are not in fact a problem of emergence that doesn't work,</blockquote>\nI'm not saying if emergence is working or not. I'm saying when emergence will appear. It doesn't always appear. If you roll a damage die, no emergence will appear (or it's a really weak emergence). There are <i>unintentional</i> emergence, like when all characters in <b>Call of Cthulhu</b> are running around with dynamite, because that's the only thing that can damage the Old Ones. But I'm not saying it's bad, fun or anything. It's just there.<br/><br/>On a further note. I feel that designing for the void or emergence is designing for emulating things. For example, in Call of Cthulhu, you got a sanity meter that simulates how frightened the character is, but if you want to look at how to emulate horror so the players will get frightened, you should start to think how to create that kind of emergent feeling. You do this by making different parts in the system (not just the rule mechanisms) work together.<br/><br/>And that's the understanding I'm after. And I feel that this explanation will give people ideas of how to design a horror game that frightens the players. Do you want a good example of a fruitful void? <b>Don't Rest Your Head</b>.

I'm coming from a social science background, for me emergence is just *there.* It cannot fail to be, given the right prerequisites.<br/><br/>For example - *of course* there's no emergence if you just roll a damage die. You're just applying a single rule - it's impossible to have emergence there because of what emergence is by definition, and that's the stuff that takes place when we get complex interactions between multiple things. You don't get emergence when you set stakes in DitV either, for example.<br/><br/>Like, the fact that you can spend time making characters but not actually playing them in games where the system has multiple fiddly bits (including, say, damage roll rules) is an emergent property of such games, even where that's not exactly the point of the game (like Burning Wheel or Apocalypse World). That's not a feeling, but it's emergent.<br/><br/>Emergence does things, but the things it does are not always good, or interesting, or intended.<br/><br/><br/>Also, you can create games that do "feelings" without anything that could be usefully described as emergent. For example, Sunshine Boulevard tells one of its players that the game is a romantic comedy, but the player's game partner and GM treat the genre as a serial killer fiction, and the unsuspectic player as victim. It's a fairly straightforward trick, a lie even, but it does produce the feeling of surprise and horror quite well.<br/><br/>Focusing on emergence is not necessarily the same thing as focusing on how games produce emotions.<br/><br/>...which is all unhelpful and definition war-y of me.<br/><br/><br/>I think the interesting thing about Vincent's idea is the picture rather than the word, as it gives you a much clearer idea of what's happening in a possible emergence-based design. Mechanics punch into each other at an angle, meaning that the various stages of the game provide a kind of impulse that's carried over - what dice you use helps determine who raises and who sees what, and so on. But the game doesn't run itself, and it requires a certain degree of player involvement to constantly make sense of what's happening. The mechanics are a pre-set loop, and that's what provides the game it's coherence. But the emotional resonance is there because the loop is open enough to constantly engage player beliefs.<br/><br/><br/>Could you say what emergence basically means for you in your words instead of the wikipedia link?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404161/#Comment_404161" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T16:03:55+00:00" title="January 20, 2013  4:03PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2013 4:04PM by Rickard.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like we're agreeing, so I'm just making this post to clear things up.\n<blockquote>Focusing on emergence is not necessarily the same thing as focusing on how games produce emotions.</blockquote>\nNo, that was just an example.

Things don't get resolved by invoking the mechanic. Anything that's sort of resolved invokes consequences that lead to further conflict. That's intentional. And that intentionally created gap is a fruitful void. The game gets better because of how the humans interact with that system and the intentional gap that the system leaves.<br/><br/>Monsterhearts has an intentionally created fruitful void. It tells the characters that their goal is to find love and acceptance. Then it tells the GM to make love hurtful and fleeting and to make acceptance conditional at best. And it only gives the characters tools for hurting each other, not for making each other feel loved or accepted. You can't use a String to heal or aid or comfort someone, only to make them feel worse. So the mechanics and the GM instructions give you nowhere to get the love and acceptance that is your goal - they repeatedly lead you to more pain and more desire for true love and lasting acceptance. That gap is intentional and is there by design. It's not just an accident of emergent behavior. It's the fruitful void at the heart of the game.<br/><br/>D&amp;D4 has a fruitful void in it's combat system. It has complex systems of movement and attack and position management and resource management that make for engaging combat. And it gives the GM tools and guidance for how to set up a challenging combat with best practices that repeatedly deliver the intended results. The fruitful void is "how are you going to use the tools you've been given to resolve this challenge while using up the least amount of your limited resources as possible?". And it works. Thousands of people struggle for thousands of hours to come up with better and better answers to that question.<br/><br/>D&amp;D4 arguably does not have a fruitful void with regard to social interactions. The best it gives you is the Skill Challenge rules, which most groups do not seem to find satisfying, as far as I understand. These rules simplify the complex interaction of a social occurrence and resolve them in a heavily mechanical way that involves only minimal creativity or roleplay. So the emergent behavior of many player groups is to just avoid them and get to the good stuff. There's a gap there. But it's not an intentionally created one and it's not one that evokes positive, engaging emergent behaviors that are meaty good stuff for the game. It's not a fruitful void, except in the meta way that it inspires some GMs and designers to look for ways to patch fix the system. <br/><br/>Yes, the fruitful void is a way of encouraging emergent behavior. In that way, the two terms are related. But no, not all emergent behavior is indicative of a fruitful void.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404278/#Comment_404278" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-22T14:30:33+00:00" title="January 22, 2013  2:30PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And with that last paragraph - combined with DWeird's and J_Walton's last paragraphs in their first posts - I'm satisfied with this thread.

We can find immersion in different things, like fiction, meaning, structures, group, and setting. The fruitful void is not about creating something, like a story, but to give a certain immersion to the participants. Will, for example, the emergent behavior result in the immersion of the life-decisions of a character (meaning)? I will quote from the link:\n<blockquote>In order to attain presence (spatial immersion), you have to do a loop between the role you take and the game world. To be able to gain flow, you will do a task and get constant feedback. If you want immersion, it will be a constant loop between the player's self-awareness about the character and the response from the game world. The skill atom claims the same thing, that a loop is happening. Each time you will have to update your own thinking. Each time you get a response, you will learn something from this loop. And what is an emotional response to learning..?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/utmaning_immersion.png"/><br/><br/>When playing a game, you will take on a role and that role will come with a WHAT. The HOW then creates the dynamic between that WHAT and the game world. The game world isn't exactly a world per se but can also be a game board, a discussion or possibly even a theme. I don't know what to call all this, where the interaction takes place, but "game world" suits the purpose at the moment. When you implement your WHAT through HOW into the game world, the response it will give is a WHY. In other words, the response can give you a sensation, give the feeling of competition, enhance your love for destruction, or a combination of those.</blockquote>\n<ul><li>When HOW and WHAT are combined in a process, it increases the investment every time the participant goes through it: The WHATs and HOWs in <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b> is: What's Wrong, Stakes, Dice, Raising and Seeing, Escalation.</li>\n<li>The WHY is the the feedback of when HOW and WHAT interacts with the game world, and should correspond to why the participant wants to participate. In Dogs, the feedback is Fallout.</li>\n<li>Understanding and adopting from the feedback is learning -&gt; release of dopamine\u2014liquid fun.</li></ul>\nSo emergence is the result of several components interacting, but in game design the result should ideally be immersion. You create that immersion through the interaction of the components in the system. A component can be a game mechanic but also the participants.<br/><br/>[edit] Operant Space as a term for "game world" is a good one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438991/#Comment_438991" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-04T08:02:16+00:00" title="October  4, 2014  8:02AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The textbook emergence game is the boardame "go", I'm only SDK level but it's beautiful how a system with a few formal rules generate such varied patterns                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439054/#Comment_439054" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T19:27:55+00:00" title="October  5, 2014  7:27PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2014 7:28PM by AsIf.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The game world isn't exactly a world per se but can also be a game board, a discussion or possibly even a theme.

"The fruitful void is about giving a certain immersion to the participants," sounds vague to me.

What I wrote in my last post had nothing to do with the original topic. What I pointed out was that "fruitful void" (and me with "emergence") talks about what is happening from interaction (WHAT+HOW+Operant Space=interaction). It talked about the a thing we can grasp as a result of interaction. My new thought was that beside this came also why we're attracted to that "thing". Fruitful void and emergence are talking about a (new) WHAT as a result of WHAT+HOW+Operant Space, when WHY is also a result of the interaction. The fault I had done was to be blinded by the WHAT and thinking that it was what a game designer should design for - "The void is fruitful when..." - when it's the investment we're creating through that constant loop that makes playing the game worth it's while.<br/><br/>So yeah, investment emerges from play ... along with the behavior we have to attune to reach it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439385/#Comment_439385" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-13T16:13:19+00:00" title="October 13, 2014  4:13PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you think it would be accurate to say that, once we acknowledge that <i>all</i> successful gameplay relies on emergent investment, the <i>reasons to invest</i> are highly particular to individual games, and thus your focus on WHAT was not misplaced?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439389/#Comment_439389" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-13T17:14:27+00:00" title="October 13, 2014  5:14PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Correct, it was just missing a part of the whole.<br/><br/>I have to correct myself and say that I was wrong with this: "The fruitful void is not about creating something, like a story, but to give a certain immersion to the participants."
