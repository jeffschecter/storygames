So, I aint sure who the author really is (I apologize for that) but I came to discover that its based on another playbook called "The Scrapper" by Jeff Russel, which Ive just met last week and found awesome too. <br/><br/>So, I went ahead and tweaked the Ruin Runner by absorbing more ideas (both conceptual and explicit) from the Scrapper that Ive found cool. The result is what you see here: <br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByF9qkt14FlUZXc5akFReFMtREU/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByF9qkt14FlUZXc5akFReFMtREU/view?usp=sharing</a>.<br/><br/>Could you please offer criticize to help me improve it ? I would like for him to be more than a mere scrap-finder and tried to gave him a more Stalker vibe, by having some badass moves (exclusive for use on dangerous terrain and landscapes).<br/><br/>Also, I would like to have him get a bit more weird, to reflect a spiritual connection to the Zone.. oops, to the dangerous ruins of the old times. ;D<br/><br/>Any help is appreciated.

It's not 100% obvious when and how you would use that move: I think it needs a specific fictional trigger. Maybe something like, "When you lead a pursuer into dangerous terrain," maybe something more involved.<br/><br/>I'm not sure the Going Aggro results make sense with this move. How do you see it mapping to the fiction? (I love the idea of the move! But it's very vague as written.)<br/><br/>Adding more of a supernatural/weird vibe is a good idea. <br/><br/>Also, it's usually spelled "jury-rigged". (But it's not necessarily wrong to write it "jerry-rigged", and who knows how people spell things in the post-apocalypse, anyway.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445940/#Comment_445940" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-04T01:28:31+00:00" title="July  4, 2015  1:28AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In response to the thread title: I don't see anything over-powered in here.

With that out the way..<br/><br/>I think Paul_T is spot on with the "They would be crazy to follow me here" move being too vague. I like the suggested "when you lead a pursuer into dangerous terrain". But "pursuer" there seems a somehow restrictive condition. What about simply "enemy" ? This way one could surprise/ambush trespassers too. What do you think ? <br/><br/>IceCreamEmperor, what did you mean with the "It has a +1Sharp move, so yes, probrably" ? Do you mean its overpowered ? <br/><br/>About the Scavenger and Jeryy-rigged moves "shop list" format, well, there is two potentially interesting things behind it: 1) a "-you avoid serious trouble" option there, which is purposeful and means that on a 7-9 it will generate instant trouble, and 2) two of the Nomad gear options (Multitool and Climbing Gear) sinnergizes with them, which I think is a pretty neat thing. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I do think Scavenger is too... "timid" right now. Im considering this modification below. See what you think..<br/><br/>Scavenger: when you spend some time searching through remnants of the old times, roll+sharp. On a 10+, <i>you find precisely what you were looking for</i> and then choose two. On a 7-9, choose one. <br/>- you find something worth +1barter<br/>- you find something that is +hi-tech<br/>- you avoid serious trouble<br/>- you do it quickly<br/><br/>This way it would continue to sinnergize with the Nomad gear, but this time it would be much more powerful in a non-"shackled/timid" way, since you can simply find what you want.<br/><br/>*Fake Edit* oh, and MisterOwl over at the other forum suggested making Bolthole its own section full of options like a MaestroD establishment or a Quarantine Stasis. Ive found it awesome. Any ideas on how to do it is welcome!<br/><br/>Thanks boys.

Ambushing people in your area is very different from trying to escape pursuit, and I can't imagine both moves using the same list of results...

Do you think its overpowered this way ? <br/><br/>I think I can see it as overpowered if its used against the very terrain inhabitants, and certainly the way its written right now allows for this. But at the same time, restricting it to use only against pursuers seems too limiting. What about <i>Ive</i> been stalking a pray to the terrain just waiting to get him ? Or if some unaware wanderer steps into it and I want to ambush him ? etc. I would not be able to use the move in these contexts by your sugegstion, right ? <br/><br/>What about I insert the condition "You and your enemy must be in dangerous terrain, <b>and he must be an outsider to it</b>, but you dont have to interact in any way, " or something in the likes ? I think the key reasoning here is that the enemy is out of its element/on a terrain he considers scary.

Like, what is the Ruin Runner actually *doing*? That should be the trigger: some kind of action on the part of the character.<br/><br/>The short version is: if I had this playbook at my table, I just know that at some point we'd go, "Hey, so, can we use this move here?" And then we'd all scratch our heads because we're not sure.<br/><br/>I like AW best when everything that happens is defined fiction-first, and in vivid colour. With "go aggro", we know there's shouting or punches or a gun drawn. With this move, I have no idea.<br/><br/>Another idea (though maybe not as interesting): you could make it a custom move that the outsider must roll.<br/><br/>"When an outsider enters your territory and you lead them <i>exactly where you want them to go</i>, have them roll+sharp/cool. (If it's an NPC, roll+Hx, and the MC chooses options for them.)<br/><br/>On a 7-9 they choose one:<br/><br/>* They still know exactly where they are.<br/>* You don't get +1 forward against them.<br/>* They haven't completely lost track of you.<br/>..."<br/><br/>Horrible examples, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>Thinking it over again, it IS better for the Ruin Runner to roll after all. On a miss, they keep doing what they're doing, and/or succeed. (i.e. If they were trying to corner you, they do. If they were trying to get away, they do.)<br/><br/>On a 7-9, you get a minor advantage over them. On a 10+, you get your choice of several advantages.<br/><br/>Seize by force might be a better starting place (except without the exchange of harm): you can frighten them or get the drop on them or you evade them and they lose track of them... they could be injured somehow, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445947/#Comment_445947" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-04T05:07:46+00:00" title="July  4, 2015  5:07AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2015 5:29AM by vini_lessa.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah! I think Im getting where youre going now. The confusion with this move is that its not being triggered by the player, but by the NPC or MC. Maybe including a condition for establishing some form of contact "I dare you! Come and get me !" or "Stop! Youre now on my domain. One step and you die!" or something in this vein could help ? Now, about turning it into a Seize by force with more flexible options, I can see its utility but I think it waters down the focus on making the terrain a weapon. In this sense, Going Aggro seems more fitting.<br/><br/>On another front, I was thinking about options for the Bolthole (is this the best label for a Ruin Runner hideout  ? "Bolthole" ? ) and came up with the following. Its just a sketch. See what you think..<br/><br/>Your bolthole sits in the middle of a dangerous and twisty terrain. Its small, well hidden and of difficult access. Characterize it:<br/>- a cave<br/>- a school bus <br/>- a basement<br/>- a tree<br/>- a boat<br/><br/>Choose 2 options:<br/>- it has an archive with maps of the old world. You get Somewhere out There* from the Tribal, but only for places.<br/>- its cozily decorated and has a warm couch  ( +1forward for something ? )<br/>- its booby-trapped. (3-harm ap area loud if tempered ?)<br/>- its isolated from the psychic maelstrom <br/>- it has a makeshift infirmary and supplies. Get Prepared for the Inevitable** from the Gunlugger.<br/><br/><br/>*Somewhere out There: name a person, thing or place and roll +Sharp. On a hit you know where it is. On 10+ the MC chooses 2. On 7-9 the MC chooses 3:<br/>- its far off<br/>- its in hostile territory<br/>- its not exactly where you thought<br/>- its not what you expected<br/>- its been claimed<br/><br/>** Prepared for the Inevitable: you have a high quality well stocked first aid kit. It counts as an angel kit with a capacity of 2-stock. <br/><br/>Thoughts ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445948/#Comment_445948" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-04T05:13:23+00:00" title="July  4, 2015  5:13AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, I was thinking about cutting out the Spooky current effect by something more.. weird.

Does the scary landscape just somehow tell them what it is they need to do, to avoid violence? In the case of the Brainer you have a) line of sight at least and b) psychic mojo to explain why the person might feel pressured to react.<br/><br/>And yes, a +1 sharp move is probably overpowered, or at the very least there is probably a reason that such a move does not exist in any of the basic playbooks (the only playbooks that can get 3 sharp do so via specific advances, and I don't even remember if there are any.) Adding a +1 stat move that does not exist anywhere else means that option is now available to all other playbooks, making it much easier to get high sharp values.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445977/#Comment_445977" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-05T20:51:22+00:00" title="July  5, 2015  8:51PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "make some sort of contact" clause on the Aggro means exactly that, no ?
