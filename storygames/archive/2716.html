Below is the ad copy for it. I have some concerns and i figured you all (as both the buying public and some people who try to sell games) could help.<br/><br/> My questions to you: Does it whet your appetite for the product? Does it confuse you about the product at all? Do you want to know more (like in a good way, as in you want to pick it up and read some)? Do you want to know more (in a bad way, as in this doesn't say enough)?<br/><br/>Some things were left out on purpose, to keep the info short and sweet. Those things are: Mention of my last game "Primitive," Mention that Agatha is played by Kiirstin Kuhi, the totally awesome (and radiant) lead singer of NYC-based rock band Ground To Machine, Mention that the game will have a special gen con price, lower than it will be in stores or online after the con, Mention that I will personally hug anyone who picks up the game (ok, thats not true, i was just seeing if you were paying attention).<br/><br/>On with the copy...<br/><br/>Gen Con 07 will see the forthcoming release of Kevin Allen Jr.'s new work "Sweet Agatha." The project is designed to exist as a bridge between the worlds of traditional fiction literature and the story telling hobby. <br/><br/>Sweet Agatha is collection of gorgeous full color artifacts including several photos, a poster, and a 20 page journal. These items all tell the story of the titular character's mysterious disappearance, casting the reader as the only person looking for the answers. As the reader progresses through the stylish, and oftentimes very cryptic journal they are instructed to cut the object apart. Page by page, the journal becomes harder to decipher; the mystery more oblique, until finally they are left with a tattered cut-apart thing and perhaps more questions about the vanishing than they started with. The material cut away becomes the clues to solving the mystery. At this point the reader gets to share the experience with a friend, and together they complete the story of Sweet Agatha through competitive, collaborative storytelling.  <br/><br/>Sweet Agatha is a roleplaying experience unlike any other. Not quite a game, and not quite a novel it is a unique product pushing the boundaries of both mediums.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62173/#Comment_62173" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-26T13:50:33+00:00" title="March 26, 2007  1:50PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would personally like to see a little more about the fiction/play experience before going into the physical object itself, I recognise the object is critical and unusual, but the story is the thing that will sell or deter me.<br/><br/>Put another way, I'd personally like to know it's a mystery first, and then be told how the physical artefact brings that to life, rather than hear about the artefact first.

Some folks aren't going to buy it regardless of marketing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62339/#Comment_62339" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-28T07:16:31+00:00" title="March 28, 2007  7:16AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite>Some folks aren't going to buy it regardless of marketing.</blockquote>\nalways a truth. and something that is hard to keep in mind (i want to get EVERYONE interested, and that will never happen, and thats fine). There are always people who are going to be turned off to the idea of breaking something they purchased. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>Seriously, the "destroy something beautiful" vibe (not to mention the "destroy something I paid for" squicks me.</blockquote>\nYeah, destroy something beautiful is a little messed up. It's from fight club, Ed Norton says it before he pummels Jordan Catilano into quasimodo-dom. But it's also an exciting prospect and it gels well with my them. You have to sacrifice things you care about to get things you ultimately care more about. Destroy probably isn't as good as Sacrifice, as thats really more the feel, but beautiful is big for me. Agatha is beautiful (she's a hot hot hottie) and i'm presenting her in a really loving light. One of my big design goals is to get you to fall in love with her. More so than simply cutting the book up you are given a couple of snapshot photos of her. In play you end up having to give these away to your friend, who is instructed to not give them back or to destroy them in front of you. The game is rife with this stuff, it makes good sense to use it as the hook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62371/#Comment_62371" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-28T11:50:25+00:00" title="March 28, 2007 11:50AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the entire concept.

It won't be for everyone, but one of the benefits is that it should immediately let people who aren't interested in it know that they aren't interested.<br/><br/>The only problem I see is that since playing requires destroying the physical artifact, I personally would want to buy (at least) two copies - one for playing and one as a keepsake.

This PDF is totally free, but it doesn't feature any of the instructions included in the physical product (so you need the original to play. The rules sheet doesn't get damaged).<br/><br/>I like to compare it to seeing a movie in the theatre and then getting the DVD. DVDs give you a lot, things that you didn't get with the film, but the experiance changes in two ways. One: the physicality is differant, ie; your watching the tv instead of in a movie house (the pdf looks differant from the print version). Two: You already know some of the secrets, and you've already witnessed an ending, so some of the magic is gone, but now you can pay attention to things you may not have noticed the first time around. Also, by the very nature of the game you can have a totally differant game experiance (story wise) the second time around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62391/#Comment_62391" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-28T15:38:21+00:00" title="March 28, 2007  3:38PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred = shilling master.

Her apartment was reduced to a collection of objects from a life interrupted. It falls on you to find her, but in order to do so you must make some hard choices. You will have to destroy something you care about to save something beautiful. <br/><br/>Gen Con 07 will see the forthcoming release of Kevin Allen Jr.'s new work "Sweet Agatha." The project is designed to exist as a bridge between the worlds of traditional fiction literature and the story telling hobby. <br/><br/>Sweet Agatha is an engrossing mystery presented in a collection of gorgeous full color artifacts including several photos, a poster, and a 20 page journal. These items all tell the story of the titular character's questionable disappearance, casting the reader as the only person looking for answers. As the reader investigates the stylish, and oftentimes very cryptic journal they are instructed to cut the object apart. Page by page, the journal becomes harder to decipher; the mystery more oblique, until finally they are left with a tattered cut-apart thing and perhaps more questions about the vanishing than they started with. The material cut away becomes the clues to solving the mystery. At this point the reader gets to share the experience with a friend, and together they complete the story of Sweet Agatha through competitive, collaborative storytelling. <br/><br/>Sweet Agatha is a roleplaying experience unlike any other. Not quite a game, and not quite a novel it is a unique product pushing the boundaries of both mediums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
