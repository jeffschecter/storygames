                    Something I was thinking about regarding Conflict Resolution as the "fix" for problems with Task-Based Resolution:<br/><br/>From the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1707" rel="nofollow">player/character divide thread</a>:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>in task resolution, you sometimes have no way of knowing if the task you are carrying out has any chance of fulfilling your player goals.  I always bring up Vincent's "break into the safe" example here.  If your player goal is to get incriminating evidence on an enemy, traditional GMs will just ask you what tasks you're trying out to get that.  They won't tell you if there's evidence in the safe until you open it.  They won't tell you if there's any evidence whatsoever anywhere, i.e., if your goal is actually attainable...  The GM wouldn't say, "Sorry, you don't have to bother, you wouldn't find anything in his house."  He'd say, "Well, go ahead and break in and find out."  <b>That's because in traditional play, the GM reacts to what the character DOES, not what you the player WANT in the larger scheme of things.</b></blockquote>
I really think that the above is not a "task resolution vs conflict resolution" thing, but rather an issue of getting the Player's Intents on the table.  Yeah, true, back in the day we never really thought about getting the player's intent as they went about doing their stuff. However, I don't think that conflict resolution is the only fix for that; <b>better task resolution</b> could just as easily fix that.<br/><br/>I've observed that in task-based games, if players start being a bit proactive with their characters, and obviously Doing Something with Intent, it's best as GM just to come straight out and ask them what their intents are. This step is simple, prevents irritation on the player's side (because the GM "isn't seeing" whatever clever thing they're trying to do), and genrally moves stuff forward without having to abandon task resolution altogether.<br/><br/>Ex: This happpens a lot. I'll be GMing some game, and one of the players (usually Alan) will start doing something "fiddly" with his character:<br/><br/>ALAN: "I'm going to look in the back seat of the car. (rolls dice) I succeed. Is there anything?"<br/>ANDY: "Uh... no?"<br/>ALAN: "OK."<br/><br/>(and I'm sitting here like, huh? What the heck was that)<br/><br/>Later on, this sort of thing started to happen:<br/>ALAN: "I'm going to look around on the desktop for anything with the bad guy's handwriting on it. (rolls dice) I succeed, is there anything? (or "I fail")"<br/>ANDY: "Uh... no. You look around and there's nothing with his handwriting on it" (thinking to myself, "Huh?")<br/>ALAN: "Damn." <br/>ALAN: (to players) "I was hoping that there was something with his handwriting on it, so that I could hire a guy to forge this dude's signature on some incriminating evidence. No big, we'll just go up and fight him." (Note: Alan will be saying this matter-of-factly, not like trying to edge in on me because I didn't provide what he wanted or anything passive-aggressive like that. He was simply stating his intention... just too late to do anything about it).<br/>ANDY (to self) "Dang, that would have been cool".<br/><br/>So nowadays, I just jump right to intentions when I start to see the player noticably do something fiddly. <br/><br/>JEREMIE: "I'm investigating the rooms upstairs. Should I make a roll?"<br/>ANDY (not really planned on having anything in those rooms): "What are you trying to do?"<br/>JEREMIE: "Well, I thought that this guy seemed suspicious, so I was thinking that if we see anything upstairs related to the Scarlet Murders, we could ask him more questions."<br/>ANDY: Oh, OK.<br/>(from here, I have two paths. Here's what I would do if I decided that this dude is clean, and that he has no role at all in the murders)<br/><br/>ANDY: No need to roll: Using your detective instinct, you wander around upstairs for a few minutes but soon realize that you're clearly not getting any weird vibes from this guy. You check around likely secret spots in his bedroom and study, but nothing out of the ordinary at all.<br/>(the player will quickly get the clues that "No, there's nothing here, so move along". Now, say that I spontaneously decide that, upon hearing Jeremie's statement, that I want this guy to be involved: Perhaps as a slavish murderer groupie who may have witnessed one of the murders if not participated in one, I could just as easily say this)<br/><br/>ANDY: "Uh... hold on a sec... Sure, yeah, no need to roll: You go upstairs, and on the study of his desk there's a leather-bound scrapbook of several newspaper articles detailing the muders.  You look around upstairs in other likely secret hiding spots, but turn up nothing.<br/><br/>In my group, it has actually evolved to the point where the player will just come right out and state what his intentions are before he starts a run of doing fiddly task-based stuff.<br/><br/>So, in other words, moving from Task to Conflict isn't always the answer.  Maybe just taking the lessons learned from good Conflict-based resolutions and folding them back into Tasks can do the trick; Sometimes a simple clearing of intentions will help you to provide the players with what they want while keeping task-based resolution. No need to throw away the baby with the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">soup</span> bathwater.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

Yep. I was going to mention something akin to this on the other thread. The moments you describe above have happened in my games, too. I probably tie CR to "solving" this problem because the CR games I've seen also are explicit about procedures of play, i.e., "What we do in this game."<br/><br/>Of course... if a game is explicit about addressing intent, isn't that, in itself, conflict resolution? Hmm.<br/><br/>I'm remembering a comment from Luke on Malcolm Sheppard's blog wherein he schools Sheppard on the purpose of Let it Ride: "It's what makes it Conflict Resolution, not Task Resolution." Ergo, the dice having the final say about achievement of intent makes BWr a CR system. The GM having the final say makes a game TR. Stating intent just makes everything less confusing. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Andy, when you clarify the intentions, it seems like you're actually clarifying the <i>conflict</i>, and hence moving to conflict resolution.<br/><br/>For example...
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>JEREMIE: "I'm investigating the rooms upstairs. Should I make a roll?"<br/>ANDY (not really planned on having anything in those rooms): "What are you trying to do?"<br/>JEREMIE: "Well, I thought that this guy seemed suspicious, so I was thinking that if we see anything upstairs related to the Scarlet Murders, we could ask him more questions."</blockquote>
It seems, to me, as though you just switched from the task "Investigate the rooms" to a conflict based on "Does Jeremie's character find anything suspicious?".<br/><br/>Doing it with intentions puts a slightly different spin on it, of course, but it seems basically as though it switched to conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Or did I misinterpret?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            There are slight differences in Conflict Res vs Task. Technically, it's about the conflict and not the task... that's slightly more nuanced than it sounds.<br/><br/>An example is you have two gladiators fighting in an arena, against seperate opponents. However, both the gladiators are trying to impress the princess. So despite the fact that they are fighting individual opponents (the task), the conflict is between the two gladiators for the love of the princess.<br/><br/>In task res, the two gladiators would roll against their individual opponents. In a hypothetical conflict res system, you would have the two gladiators rolling against each other with the fight just being color.<br/><br/>[edit] <i>Though I'm not sure if Andy's example crosses the line or not. It might still be task res, or it might be conflict res with a high tie-in to character abilities.</i> [/edit]                        </div>

                            What Graham said. <br/><br/>Guys, the DIFFERENCE between task and conflict resolution is as follows (I'm quoting Vincent Baker, whom I believe has it nailed): 
<blockquote>That's, if you ask me, the big problem with task resolution: whether you succeed or fail, the GM's the one who actually resolves the conflict. The dice don't, the rules don't; you're depending on the GM's mood and your relationship and all those unreliable social things the rules are supposed to even out.<br/><br/>Task resolution, in short, puts the GM in a position of priviledged authorship. Task resolution will undermine your collaboration.</blockquote>
We keep beating around the bush! <br/><br/>The fucking difference between Task Resolution and Conflict Resoluton? GM FIAT. <br/><br/>This is why I don't LIKE GM fiat. It is also why I say GM fiat is not objectively bad, but not my preference, either. <br/><br/>If you can enjoy task resolution, then fine. Go nuts, I say. <br/><br/>But, you know what the real bitch is? The line gets pretty fuzzy. I read Andy's post here and think "Jeez, Andy's got good stuff here, but it's conflict resolution. Why is he calling it task resolution?" And for that matter, "Why are we so eager to cling to task resolution, as if justifying it makes us feel better about a more equitable hobby or something?" This is weird. <br/><br/>People keep missing the fine line where task resolution becomes conflict resolution. HINT: Addressing and then resolving players intentions ain't task resolution!                        </div>

                            Tim, isn't it possible to resolve the parallel gladiator thingy with actual fights?<br/><br/>Let's say they're fighting two opponents, and we're playing TSoY. It could go down two ways at least: <br/><br/>1) The gladiators "fight" each other using, I dunno, fighting or social skills. Their "Fight" is represented by beating down their independent opponents and getting crowd reaction or something. The are actually rolling against one another as player characters.<br/><br/>2) The gladiators actually fight their respective opponents. BUT, the one with the higher margin / victory level wins the princess' favor. They are rolling against non-player characters, but stribing for the best / highest margin to compare with one another.                        </div>

                            Also, guys, DICE DON'T DECIDE SHIT. <br/><br/>They are inanimate objects with symbols on them. They couldn't decide their way out of a wet paper bag. <br/><br/>Rather, people as a group agree that when those dice symbols align in a certain way, they won't change the outcome. I.e. people decide, not dice. They agree, as a group, that something happens fictionally, and they stick with it. If anyone doubts, everyone else can point to the symbols and say "See that? It means we've agreed not to doubt this. This is what happens, not THAT. If you don't want to go along with that, we need to talk about what our agreement was."

                            In most of the described cases, it doesn't sound like a distinction between "player intent" and "character intent" so much as a distinction between character means and character ends - levels of character intent, basically.<br/><br/>In the search the car example, it doesn't SOUND like it's the case that<br/><br/>The PLAYER would like to have his character be able to forge the signature.<br/>The CHARACTER <i>lacks any interest</i> in forging the guy's signature.<br/><br/>In the search upstairs example it doesn't SOUND like it's the case that<br/><br/>The PLAYER thinks the guy may have a connection to the murders.<br/>The CHARACTER has no suspicions on that score.<br/><br/>What seems to be happening is a move to resolving larger character goals the player articulates. That seems to be the case in the Famous Vincent's Safe example too.<br/><br/>Now, in a game like CAPES, I probably am engaged in resolving true player intents - I want something that's orthogonal or opposed to what the character I'm narrating for wants. But in a lot of other conflict resolution games, it seems like what's being resolved are character goals articulated more completely than in classic "iterative" play.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/><br/>Jim                        </div>

Well, it tends to start to get fuzzy after a bit of abstraction.  In all my examples above I used single-roll examples, which are basically either task or conflict.<br/><br/>I could still conceive of a series of task-y rolls, and with overall intent, ground the tasks in an overall conflict. Like Tim's example of the gladiators.<br/><br/>Hmmm. When you add intentions to task-based resolution, things really start to blend together.  "Is it just a bunch of tasks simply framed/crystalized in the background of overall intents of the Players involved?"  "Is it actually then just one giant conflict broken up into smaller tasks once intentions are stated?"  I'm firmly thinking the Former, but it would probably take me like a day of thinking and about 6 written paragraphs to explain why.<br/><br/>And even then, it might not even be worth dissecting at that level; if it satisfies, and it works, then what's the focus should be on.  <br/><br/>Hmmm. More thoughts later.                        </div>

  Of course... if a game is explicit about addressing intent, isn't that, in itself, conflict resolution? Hmm.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p>You're not just resolving a task. You're using a particular tool to resolve a conflict.</p>
<p>Matt's exactly right, which should surprise no one, and since it happens so often, you should probably just listen to what he says.</p>
<p>We used to play this way. It started (this would be late '80s)  because I had a character inventing networked computers in 1902. I said that I was doing some little detail differently. The GM didn't know much about computers, and asked, flabbergastedly, "What are you trying to do?" I told him the intention behind what I was doing â€” that I was making it so that computers inherently shared information, making it the preferred medium for citizen journalists â€” and he understood that. (My arch-enemy wound up being William Randolph Hearst, btw. He had my dude assassinated, but too late. I was a martyr!)</p>
<p>"What are you trying to do?" became the default question for whenever we didn't understand why a player was doing something. It was, after all, what we wanted to know, so asking seemed the direct route to finding out. It was rudimentary, but it was Conflict Resolution. So's what you're doing.</p>
<p>I think Matt's equivocating a  little too much. I won't do that.</p>
<p>Task Resolution doesn't resolve anything except for those direct impacts on resources, like hit points or whatever. Dice roll, hit points are refigured, and <em>then the GM makes up what happens.</em> If you're having fun doing this, it's because you're using some subtle system that resolves the conflict, like the one we're talking about here.</p>

                            Wow! That's really interesting. A question just popped in my brain. (Gawd, I think I'm already wildly de-railing Andy's thread. Sorry, Andy.)<br/><br/>Is Task resolution really a means by which players do stuff, and that doing stuff serves two purposes:<br/><br/>1) It moves stuff around / expands stuff on "your" character.<br/><br/>2) It provides narrative constraints to the GM, who is really the only person resolving conflicts and creating story.<br/><br/>Whereas, conflict resolution usually does <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and also distributes <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. It provides players more tools than simple narrative constraints to feed to the GM. <br/><br/>This would explain why people keep getting caught up when talking about GM Fiat. They keep saying things like "It's not GM fiat because my good roll 'informs' the GM. He can't ignore that I rolled a 20!" Well, sure he can. But, it's a narrative constraint. Usually, he doesn't HAVE to follow the constraint, but he can.<br/><br/>So, narrative constraint from players does not dismantle GM fiat. Neat. I think that's right, anyway.<br/><br/>Total aside: I directly observe people enjoying task resolution because of No. 1. I can point to a specific person who I know gets a hard on for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. This same person is barely interested in challenging <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, and will happily go along for the GM's ride, so long as he gets his character resource cialis (ew!).                        </div>

                            So yeah, that quote was from me, but people have already started explaining why I put it that way.  Once you take player goals into account, you are probably crossing into CR territory.  But not necessarily <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Voicing goals is only one step--actually resolving goals is another.<br/><br/>There are two parts to my example on which I'd like to elaborate.  One is the player/character shared knowledge thing.  The other is the prepared-versus-spontaneous thing.  Both are integral to what I consider "traditional" play, mainly because it's traditional for me, and it's how most people I've played or talked about RPGs with have always played.<br/><br/>So in this style of play:  You are not told anything that your character doesn't know, and all of the important information is prepared or randomly assigned via certain probabilities.  These two aspects are important because they are considered necessary for you to play your character properly and simulate what the character would really do.  There's a whole sleuth of issues here that have their foundation in the rub between "playing to win" and "playing to simulate" (which many non-theory-heads try to describe as the roll-v-role issue).  But only the first one--being told wheter/how to address the goal--stands in the way of CR.<br/><br/>Now: as I pointed out in the example, I might already tell my GM what my intent is.  But his traditional response would be, "So what do you do?"  That means we're still not necessarily resolving the goal.  <br/><br/>What you need to drift TR to CR is to voice the goal, be told how/whether you can achieve it, and have a definitive resolution of it.  You can do this with a traditional TR system if you eliminate the player/character knowledge thing and thereby cut out all of the rolls that would not have contributed to achieving the goal.  The GM might still tell you that your goal is unattainable, but that's ok, because there are unattainable goals in almost every CR system out there.<br/><br/>However, once you make this step, you're blowing the whole player/character thing to pieces, and that just doesn't work for a lot of players.  Because now your character is no longer doing what's most likely, he's doing what the player wants her to do to achieve a particular goal.<br/><br/>As a side note, the second part--the prepared-versus-spontaneous thing--is where the GM can decide whether to focus on simulating the world or on providing the players with the means to achieve their goals.  This is another huge step that a lot of players don't want to make.                        </div>

                            First off, I don't buy the definition of conflict resolution as being that thing that <b>automatically occurs</b> when a player is clear about his intents.<br/><br/>A player being clear about his intentions merely means that you have now achieved what I believe is the minimum healthy standard for player-to-player/player-to-GM communication at the table.  That's all.  I would say you've given yourself a much better shot at fulfilling your social contract, and achieved a firm footing for a lot of things, but that doesn't take it into the explicit game-space for me.<br/><br/>Once those intentions are clear, the GM and players can decide whether or not resolution (of any kind) is necessary in order to get narration to proceed.  This is the "say yes" part of "say yes or roll dice".  "Say yes" is "proceed, no resolution necessary"; "or roll dice" is "we have two or more interesting things that could happen here, and need to choose what should happen".<br/><br/>So, once you've figured out whether you're going with <i>simply proceeding</i> or you're instead deciding that <i>resolution is called for</i>, THEN it becomes relevant whether you're operating at the "macro" conflict resolution scale or the "micro" task resolution scale.  I say macro and micro in quotes because I know not everyone sees those as a matter of magnification -- but I do (and it's part of why Fate had scene resolution, exchange resolution, and turn resolution, which in turn inspired Clinton to produce Bringing Down The Pain in TSOY as the way to go "micro" on a scene resolution).<br/><br/>So let's look at "conflict resolution" and "task resolution".<br/> <br/>For me, I perceive conflict resolution (a misnomer, I think, but I'll get into that in a bit) as when the story-structure is <i>directly</i> addressed and altered through the application of mechanics.  Explicitly stating: Does the safe have the plans in it, or do ninja guards drop down from the ceiling and attack, preventing opening the safe? -- That's what I see happening in conflict resolution systems (and note, that this sort of A or B doesn't occur until after you've concluded that there are two or more interesting things that could happen here -- you're on a different branch from the "say yes" stuff).<br/><br/>To flip that around, the character's competency at what he is doing <i>may</i> not (necessarily!) assessed or addressed in conflict resolution, <i>unless that competency is what the conflict is actually about</i>.  In the above safecracking example I gave, the "conflict" isn't about the character's ability.  It's instead about whether or not he gets access to information which is already assumed to be available.  It's about time pressure and secrecy.<br/><br/>It's also operating at a level of abstraction that is for me where I find myself not always liking conflict resolution.  Because conflict resolution is very often conflated with scene resolution.  One interation of the resolution mechanics is performed, and then we the scene's big deal is addressed.  This bores me to hell and gone, and is part of why PTA is a dud for me.  But it's not insurmountable.  As I've posted (a few months ago) in my livejournal, Dogs in the Vineyard gets around this by, yes, resolving a scene (or "a single conflict" -- remember, the two get conflated, sometimes appropriately, sometimes not) in a single iteration of the resolution system -- but that resolution TAKES TIME, and is broken down, internally, into a bunch of smaller atoms that preserve suspense about the outcome over the course of the resolution (*).<br/><br/>Task resolution, for me, is smaller-than-a-scene resolution.  The conflict may be an outer container in which multiple tasks occur.  And again, remember, we are digging into the task resolution because we are on a separate branch from "say yes".  Intent has still been stated, and multiple interesting outcomes are on the table, and the resolution system must be used to figure out which of those interesting outcomes will come to pass.  <i>But on a single iteration of the resolution system, the conflict is not necessarily addressed in its entirety.</i> <br/><br/>Let's go back to the safecracking thing.  In the exact same setup with the exact same set of interesting outcomes (you get to the safe and you get it opened and you get the info inside OR somewhere along the way the ninjas stop you and there's a fight), task resolution breaks this down into several tasks, which need to be achieved in sequence in order to get to one of the outcomes (getting the information); failure at one of those tasks means you'll get the other (ninjas!).  The character's competencies have a chance to shine in each of these moments, and if they prove incompetent for the task at question, something else interesting occurs (ninjas!).  So, the character might have a Security Systems task, a Stealth task, and a Safecracking task to resolve.  Great!  <i>This is still task resolution, despite the player having been clear about his intentions.</i><br/><br/>* On some level, Dogs is a hybrid.  It addresses the conflict/scene level, and it addresses the task/action level, at the same time.  This is one aspect of its brilliance that I don't think gets talked about nearly enough.<br/><br/>So really we have these scenarios:<br/><br/>Player states intent: I'm going to break in, get to the safe, crack it, and see if the information's inside.  I want to get that evidence.<br/><br/>Situation #1: GM does not believe the information's in this safe.  <b>GM chooses "Say Yes"</b><br/>Result: GM says: "No need to roll.  You get in, get to the safe, and crack into it, but the information's not there.  Now what?"<br/><br/>Situation #2: GM does believe the information's in this safe, and is using 'conflict'/'scene' resolution.  <b>GM chooses "or roll the dice" with conflict resolution.</b> <br/>Result: GM says: "Okay, you're going to have to get past trained ninja guards to do this.  So I see a conflict here -- do you get the info from the safe silently and secretly and swiftly, or do you get discovered by the ninjas before the job's complete?  Let's roll the dice and resolve this question."<br/><br/>Situation #3: GM does believe the information's in this safe, and is using task/action resolution.  <b>GM chooses "or roll the dice" with task resolution.</b><br/>Result: GM says: "Okay, you're going to have to get past trained ninja guards to do this.  Once you do that, you'll have to crack the safe without taking too long or tripping any alarms.  Let's do the Stealth task first -- if you fail that, you don't even get to the safe, but you may find yourself fighting the ninjas.  If that succeeds, we'll move on to the Safecracking task -- with the same failure consequence.  Succeed at both, and you've got the info."<br/><br/>(continued in next post)                        </div>

                            Long-winded, yes, but I think I've made my point: I don't think it's appropriate to conflate the clear statement of player intent with the distinction between resolving a conflict vs. resolving a task.  Whether or not you're getting past it a conflict in a single iteration is what matters, to me, once you've gotten to "or roll the dice".  But this is also why I look at "conflict resolution" as a bad phrase for it.  For me it's <b>scene resolution or task resolution</b> -- both address conflicts, because that's what any resolution system does, period.<br/><br/>Instead, I'd push the perspective that intents give you the lens for determining when resolution is necessary.  And -- as it so happens -- Rob and I have already pushed this perspective in Spirit of the Century ... which happens to support both scene and task resolution.  Take a look at page 222, which I'll excerpt here:
<blockquote>Before you -- the GM -- call for a die roll, it is critically important that you stop and do two things:<br/><br/>1. Imagine Success<br/>2. Imagine Failure<br/><br/>It sounds simple, but it can make a critical difference.  Success is usually the easy part, but failure can be a bit trickier.  You want to make sure that <b>both</b> outcomes are interesting, though interesting certainly doesn't need to mean good.<br/><br/>If you cannot come up with a way to handle either outcome, you need to rethink the situation.<br/><br/>It's as simple as that, because there are few things more frustrating to a player than making a skill roll and getting told that it nets them no new knowledge, no suggested course of action, no new development for the story, and so on.</blockquote>
In Don't Rest Your Head, I shorthand this thinking to "Only roll when it's interesting or important".  <br/><br/>Clarity on these issues, however we've phrased them, however, is vital, and that's what the statement of intent gets you.  But it doesn't automatically put you in "not task resolution".  Task resolution or scene resolution is the granularity at which you address that intent, and both of them should happen only when you can imagine success and imagine failure as both interesting outcomes.  And when we use the word "resolution" in a game, it's implicitly got "conflict" built in, right?  Because there's no need -- EVER! -- to "resolve" something that isn't a conflict.<br/><br/>So my flowchart would go something like...<br/><br/>1. State intentions (I intend to get the secret info from the safe).<br/>2. If intentions indicate only one interesting outcome, no resolution is necessary; narration can proceed to the point of satisfying the intentions (discovery there is no secret info).<br/>3. If intentions indicate multiple outcomes (getting secret info or being prevented from secret info due to ninjas), resolution is necessary to determine how or if the intentions are satisfied.<br/>3a. If using scene resolution, the intentions can be addressed directly by a single iteration of the resolution system (secret info or ninjas? roll!).<br/>3b. If using task resolution, the intentions serve as a goal at the end of a chain of tasks.  In its simplest form, failure on any one of those tasks branches to an alternative, not-intentions-satisfying outcome (ninjas!).  If all of those tasks succeed, then the intentions are satisfied (secret info!).                        </div>

<p>Fred, you're just talking about different scales of conflict resolution. If you resolve the intentions of the players through principled application of the system, that's conflict resolution. That tasks are resolved in the process does not change the more important part that the conflict is being resolved.</p>
<p>Here's a hypothetical system. I'm playing a GM of some sort. You're playing a protagonist.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Fred: I want vengeance on that wizard who killed my sister. She was a 74-point relationship for me, so you get 74 points of opposition.</p>
<p>J: OK. (writes that down.)</p>
<p>Fred: I'm going to break into his tower.</p>
<p>J: OK, the lock is magical and talks back. It's 12 points of opposition (I mark off 12 of my 74 points). Roll vs. 12 on your Sophistry skill.</p>
<p>Fred: I get 14. I sophistrize the crap out of him. He gets confused and agrees to open the door as a demonstration of his free will, just to prove that he has it. I get the leftover 2 points for later.</p>
<p>J: When you get into the hallway, there's a minion. He's a big, hairy body with huge muscles and no head, just, like, a puckered sphincter where you'd expect for there to be a neck. It "faces" you, and its body language tells you that its surprised. It's 22 points of asskicking of you! Roll vs. 22 on Asskicking!</p>
<p>Fred: Crap! It's not worth the risk right now! I'm using my Run Away! ability and roll against half the dude's Asskicking value â€” I get a 12! I run away, get a point, and the minion can't get me!</p>

<p>Eventually, a lot of stuff will have happened, you'll have confronted the wizard (and maybe failed to have achieved vengeance), and we'll have resolved the conflict.</p>
<p>The point is that I can't just make shit up to throw in your path â€” I have rules (that, in this case, are clearly underthought) that I have to use as your opposition that are used to resolve the conflict, and you get to do things that you know are related to the outcome you want. Like, maybe I use up all my points making minions and traps and stuff, and I've only got one point left for the wizard himself. He's surrounded by crackling energy, the sky opens up and so forth, but I've only got a 1 â€” you extract your vengeance. I've played my pieces, and that's how it came out.</p>
<p>This is not a hybrid. This is long-form Conflict Resolution.</p>
<p>Fred, what I hear you saying is, "Conflict Resolution is obviously required for functional play. I just don't like the short form CR type from PTA or Shock: (which can have multiple conflicts in a scene, but it's not usually more than two)" That's not a difference between CR and TR, though. Everything you're talking about that is function is used to resolve entire conflicts. There only question is the amount of detail, and that's a design-level variable that addresses aesthetic, not functional, goals.</p>
<p>(I'm really, seriously not saying that the system I just described is good. It's just an example of the scale of a Conflict being well beyond one little scene.)</p>

You could get all cerebral and call it "dysfunctional communication" or "destructive opacity". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think destructive opacity is possible with scene resolution too, mind you, though it may be less likely: "But I didn't <i>care</i> about whether or not my father would let me back into the house!"<br/><br/>Yeah.  In my mind, this all comes down to clear vs. opaque.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Fred, you're just talking about different scales of conflict resolution.</blockquote>
One of those scales is TASKS.  Folks are setting up a dichotomy between TASKS and CONFLICTS, and that's a false dichotomy.<br/><br/>Frankly, I assert that it's your terminology that's broken.  Not mine.<br/><br/>Edit: In other words, because conflicts can be resolved task-by-task, calling the thing which isn't conflict resolution "task resolution" is misleading and wrong-headed.  By labelling that 'task resolution', you're implying by the very term itself that anything that resolves something task-by-task is not conflict resolution.  But you've already shown that you agree with me that it's not the case that resolving things task-by-task can't occur in conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Therefore, there are two dichotomies here, being laid out as one.<br/><br/>There's "Clarity (and, thus, consequentiality) of Player Intentions" vs "Opacity (and, thus, inconsequentiality) of Player Intentions"<br/><br/>And there's "Task-by-task resolution" and "Scene-by-scene resolution".<br/><br/>I'm asserting that the first dichotomy lays out whether your play is healthy.  Open communications of player intent is mandatory for healthy play.  Period.  You don't have that, and you'll end up with a game that doesn't make people happy.  Don't play that way.  Set it aside.<br/><br/>The second one is entirely encompassed in your idea of Conflict Resolution.  To which I say: Duh.  You call it 'long-form conflict resolution' vs 'short-form conflict resolution'.  Long form is what I call task resolution, and rightly so, because it addresses things task-by-task.  <br/><br/>Only when you get 'task-by-task resolution' PLUS 'opacity of intention' do you get what *you're* calling task resolution.  But that unfairly paints all task-by-task resolution as unhealthy.<br/><br/>The term 'task resolution' is wildly inaccurate.<br/><br/>But I sense this is going to devolve from here, so I'll happily bow out since I'm not using the Official Lexicon.   I'll take my natural language over to my corner and lurk. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

But only the first one--being told wheter/how to address the goal--stands in the way of CR.</blockquote>
Exactly. To illustrate it further:<br/><br/>Consider yourself, as a living and breathing human being, standing outside the often mentioned safe. You are the charater context. You don't know what's in it. You have to open it to know. This is task resolution in character context; wheter something is in the safe or is not, is completely beyond you. You could assume that there is something, but until you open it, you just don't know. The Universe knows. The universe could be GM deciding there is something, GM having knowledge there is something, or some rules deciding there is something. The actual mechanism is not that important, it could suck or or not.<br/><br/>Now, conflict resolution blows this up. You have hard time convincing yourself that you're that living, breathing human outside the safe, since your perception is suddenly warped and expanded - you know that something could or could not be in the safe and this depends on some abstract mechanism. That knowledge resides outside the character context, and is only known to the player. This is the player context, which also tells you that you're not the Jack, the sweaty and nervous safe-cracker man, but Joe the player, who's ass itches because he's been sitting on the sofa for three hours.<br/><br/>For some people, being Joe the player is all good and dandy because that allows them to (fill in your preferences, if you fit this description). Some other people do not wish be aware of Joe the player - they want to be Jack the safe-cracker, because being Jack the safe-cracker is why they are here. For their purposes, Joe the player who's ass itches isn't there. Fuck Joe. They get to be Joe for the rest of their lives and Joe does not get to crack safes. Conflict resolution tends to bring Joe to the picture, because it abstracts things beyond character context.<br/><br/>Everythings swell if all players wish to do the first one or all the players wish to do the second one. It's just a preference. There could be more options for all I know. Those who don't get to make an informed decision are the unlucky folks. The group of players which has both preferences and don't make an informed decision might end up confused.<br/><br/>As for the intentions, I've noticed that even with the second option, GM's tend to stay informed - characters tend to articulate what they're going to do, make plans and ponder out aloud.<br/><br/><i>Edited to add: Some lucky folks claim to be able to get best of the both worlds.

                            Fred, the thing that's different is that task+task+task+task does not necessarily add up to resolution of intent. When the tasks are part of a whole, such that each task represents movement toward/away from intent (or an opportunity to alter intent), you've got conflict resolution. When the tasks are just discrete things, which may or may not even relate to intent (typically at the GM's discretion, but not always - sometimes the rules will just call for something fiddly to happen), then you've got "mere" task resolution. Any task I do, I don't know whether it meaningfully adjusts my position, or how. Often, there's not even any WAY for it to affect my positioning with respect to my intent, except as the GM sees fit - because the system doesn't provide any mechanical way for one task to connect to another.<br/><br/>The position, as I see it, is not "Task Resolution: Teh Suk" but "Task Resolution: Not Good Enough On Its Own".                        </div>

<p>Mark's right.</p>
<p>Fred, what's going on is that you have a <em>perfectly functional</em> mode of play, and you're assuming that everyone plays like that. You're taking a generous reading of game texts because you've found an excellent technique by which you play and have perceived that playing otherwise stinks.</p>
<p>Here's what is probably obvious to you:</p>
<p>Task Resolution: It resolves tasks only. They may or may not result in furthering the conflict. The input from the task into the conflict is entirely a matter of whim, taste, social pressure, or whatever. The point is that it <em>only</em> resolves tasks.*</p>
<p>Conflict Resolution: A system of resolving conflicts. This may be a function of resolving tasks, weighing player interests, randomness, or whatever. You know, however, that it resolves the conflict.</p>
<p>This is not a dichotomy. One is  a method of resolving conflicts. Another is a method of doing things that probably add color and may effect resources, but don't resolve the conflicts.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, what I said about the cycle of conflicts in PTA and Shock: is an oversimplification: There's another scale of conflict that both have: PTA's issue resolution is season-scale conflict resolution, as is Story Goal resolution in Shock: where it gets addressed completely once a game for short story one-shots, or every few episodes for longer games.)</p>
<p>*This is not a problem in a dungeon crawl situation because killing the critter is the conflict itself. You get XP, you get its goodies, whatever. The issue comes up when you start pushing the game beyond its design specs: "I don't want to kill him. I want him to be afraid of me. How many hit points does he have to lose before he runs away to tell his master, so I can follow him to find out where his master is?" Bhuuuuhhh... 50%? How about 50%. Uh, rounded... down. Then he'll run away... I don't know if he'd run to his master, though....</p>

                            Fred, I've got no argument that task resolution and conflict resolution aren't problematic. I've participated and read MANY discussions related to the terms, and people are indeed all over the map. <br/><br/>I would find it extremely helpful if you would define, as simply as possible, the difference between the two. What are YOU talking about?<br/><br/>And, importantly, what are WE talking about. Please indicate whether you agree or disagree what I'm advocating: That the only definitional difference between the two is whether or not resolution is determined by the GM. (i.e. Gm fiat, which, yes, I realize also isn't everyone's favorite term).<br/><br/>EDIT: Fred, after re-reading, I think I'm getting what you're saying now. And, really, I don't disagree with your objection of the use of the term "task". But, at the same time, you're not really addressing other things brought up in the thread, and I'm curious to hear what you think of those things. Hopefully, you're not ducking out completely, but it's cool if you've said your piece.                        </div>

                            What I mean:<br/><br/>A "conflict resolution system" is identical to a "resolution system", as *I* tend to use the terms.  Resolution systems resolve the conflict between mutually exclusive outcome A and outcome B [, C, D, ...], classically 'success' and 'failure'.  <br/><br/>When I say "task resolution", I mean "task-by-task resolution".  Resolution, using task-sized.  Pretty obvious.  When I say "scene resolution", I mean "scene-by-scene resolution".  Resolution, using scene-sized grains.  Conflict resolution contains both task resolution and scene resolution as a matter of pacing.<br/><br/>The granularity dial can be turned from tasks to scenes and back and forth, no problem.  This is a separate axis from whether player intents are clear and relevant, or whether they're either opaque (thus irrelevant) or clear, but not factored in, thus irrelevant.  As I've said several times now, intent-irrelevant play is (or at least strongly tends to be) unhealthy, because it's a recipe for people not getting pleasurable, frictionless, relevant play.<br/><br/>What YOU mean:<br/><br/>I hear people saying "conflict resolution" when they mean "intent-relevant play" and "task resolution" when they mean "intent-irrelevant play".  Those labels suck to the point of uselessness, because they're using words that aren't on-point. <br/><br/>"Intent-relevant play" on the other hand says exactly what you all keep *meaning* when you say "conflict resolution".  It's about intentions, and those intentions being relevant.<br/><br/>I agree that in intent-<b>irrelevant</b> play (or, to use my shorthand, 'unhealthy play'), the GM resolves things without taking the intentions of the players (or the players' characters, depending on another dial that I'm not going to get into) into account.   As a result, the GM frequently embarks on a course that does not efficiently maximize player interest and investment in the events of play.<br/><br/>I agree that in intent-<b>relevant</b> play, the GM resolves things by taking the intentions of the players into account.

Calling it "conflict resolution" doesn't inform me what the term means at all (as I take it to be a synonym for, simply, "resolution").<br/><br/>Much as calling intent-irrelevant play "task resolution" not only doesn't inform me what the term means, but actively muddles what it's intended to mean.<br/><br/>See? By making the intent of the terms clear, and then treating that intent as relevant, and renaming the terms so that the terms communicate their meaning, it gets a lot more efficient. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

I agree that intent-irrelevant play == all the power stays in the GM's hands.  <b>Relevancy</b> is the function whereby the GM adopts the players' intents, right?  Which is what you're saying.                        </div>

                            Fred, cool. Yep, I think we're agreeing basically on all points. Joshua and I are coming into this topic riddled with bullets from miles of text arguing about whether SCALE defined task vs. conflict, and we're coming in using the Forge's accrued understandings, all that. So, yeah, I totally get why that language sucks, and you're arguing against it. And, you're totally getting why we point to certain things and say "This not that. NOt that, this over here."

<p>Yeah, I totally, 100% agree with Fred's meaning. And I agree that, upon closer inspection, the terms have baggage from their origins that is misleading.</p>
<p>Task-only resolution is a frequent tool of dysfunctional play, particularly in a system like D&amp;D, where you infrequently gain from a conflict (only when you level or get goodies better than what you've got, or sell the goodies that aren't), but almost always lose resources (HP, potions, spells). That means that, if I want to keep you guys from going somewhere, I can grind, grind, grind away your resources by having lots of rolls that cost you a little bit each time. Or we can play out <em>exactly the same fiction</em> with fewer rolls, if I want you to go that way. Because it's a tool for that kind of crap, it very reasonably came under suspicion. But, really, the issue is that the GM is responsible for for both fairness of the environment and the opposition (DUH), and that fact gives the GM authority over the value of the players' actions.</p>
<p>BTW, I think that the explicit stating of stakes isn't inherent to intent-relevant play. You can arrive at character/plot/relationship/&amp;c.-relevant stuff through any number of functional methods. If all my resources are people I use, and my decisions about them determine mechanically whether they benefit or are harmed by the fictional events of the game, this game probably doesn't need explicit stakes. The stakes are my relationships with those people. I can charge into conflict, not knowing at all what will come out, perhaps not knowing what the fight's about, and the result of the conflicts will be the stuff I care about. The "intents" (as I call them in Shock: and Fred is callng them here) are written down. That stuff is <em>always</em> staked. That requires some very serious mechanical support, I think; it can't just be duct taped on.</p>

                            Interesting side thought:<br/><br/>Could you mechanically limit the number of rolls that any resolution is allowed to contain?

                            Many, many games have such limits (currency &amp; resources: that's what games are all about!), but few leap to mind with <i>specific</i> integer limits. <br/><br/>Galactic, which I'm playtesting with Matt Wilson, does this, although it's a bit more open now after some feedback and testing. As a player, your protagonist captain participates in "adventures" which have specific over-arching goals. The original version we played mandated no greater than 5 conflicts, and that 3 victories / losses determiend one of two sub-conflicts.<br/><br/>I'm working on 44, which will have a countdown clock. This basically means you have that many conflict rolls, although greater success can push back the clock. So, if you play an "8-hour" game, you'll have about 8 conflict rolls/scenes (and each scene is 1 roll only).                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>Do you sense, from anyone, the need or the atmosphere that task resolution needs defending.</blockquote>
No, but in case we are talking past each other, let'stry clear that one out, in any case.<br/><br/>Conflict resolution/intent-relevant resolution is a good tool; as a tool, it's a lot better than task resolution. It's more egolocical and it's suits fast(er) paced play very well. To be precise, it suits A Story Game way more better than task/intent-irrelevant resolution. In case of Story Games, it does not wreck the context of character, because the odds are that the game is not designed for such style of playing in the first place. This is usually pretty well stated in the game text. <br/><br/>Task resolution/intent-irrelevant resolution works better with style of play that builds upon staying in the context of the character. That's not saying that it usually performs well; it could well be one of the reasons why such styles of play gradually evolve towards freeform playing. Either because it's not really working or because it's not really used. Because, unlike in (many) Story Games, resolution mechanics don't hang in the nexus of things - they are pretty irrelevant and sporadically used, because the play is slow paced and centerns around dialogue (this is also why the GM Fiat thing is muddled; he rarely resolves things for players, and more like acts as supporting charaters to add his part into the dialogue). It does work for occasional crack-the-safe, though.<br/><br/>Task resolution/intent-irrelevant resolution mechanics could and probably will give out poorer results in play where it's used often and is in the nexus of things. It certainly seems to do that when the players are not informed what they should be doing. Using such resolution with style of play leaning towards Story Games is pretty ankward.<br/><br/>It's not about Fun; there are different kinds of "fun" that different styles of play produce. It's about right tools that get a job done - or tools that wreck the job because they are not designed for it. So, to address Andy's initial question: fixing resolution starts from understanding what you're set to do and choosing tools for it.                        </div>

I'm still not sure I buy this. Based on Fred's perspective, I don't see why it should matter. How is relevance of intent at odds with immersion?                        </div>

Because Immersion rarely builds on relevance. Relevance is about knowing what you do and aim for; it's about moving things forward in coherent manner, having a clear goal. Immersion is not about relevance, unless you're playing with characters and situation which are and which is supposed to move forward in coherent manner and with a clear goal. Immersion is about simulating human (or others, though it's arguably a lot harder) behaviour and human behaviour is rarely coherent and straight forward. It's muddled, it's filled with emotional hodgepodge and it relies on uncertain and often not-said-out-aloud communication. That's the meat of it. That's where the strong emotions come from. That is, for the immersive players, intresting - and, I'd put out a hazard guess, pretty boring for people coming from elsewhere. And that's cool - that's why there are different styles of play.<br/><br/>The irrelevance of task resolution, kind of, works with this. It's about groping around in the dark, instead of seeing two or more ways a story can emergene from a conflict. Immersive players don't want clarity, they want to be left in the dark and feel their way around. Because that, pretty often, is what we humans do. And, granted, immersive players tend to emphasize that because it's something that generates a lot of content and it let's them to build their character.                        </div>

I'm still not sure I buy this. Based on Fred's perspective, I don't see why it should matter. How is relevance of intent at odds with immersion?<br/><br/>Well, to point at the above diagram, I can get my immersion in the first column with ease, the second column with only marginal difficulty, and the third one -- for me, at least -- only in the first row of the third column.  Soon as you take me to scene-based stuff where my intentions directly translate to what gets resolved -- then I've stepped out of character stance and gone into author or directorial stance pretty much as a given, I think.<br/><br/>My personal preference for play is anything in column <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> -- which I see as the gray area between "intention-irrelevant play" and "intention-relevant play" -- and the first row of column <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.  Anything in column <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is bunk, and interestingly, I often find row <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> of column <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> (scene-based, intention-relevant play) to leave me cold, too.  But a LOT of story-games live there.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this diagram goes a long way towards clarifying for me why PTA *tends* to be a dud for me unless I approach it at the get-go with the perspective that I'm not going to identify with my character at all.                        </div>

                            Nice. I like coming in when it's all figured out already. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I play Clear Task, Relevant Task, with occasional forays into Clear Scene, Relevant Scene, but really only if I sense that nobody's actually interested in doing it in more detail.<br/>
<br/>
That is, when I do a fight in HQ, and do it with only one roll, I usually narrate the result like, "You step forward, and with one stroke, cut off his left hand so quickly he can't even respond. He runs for it."<br/>
<br/>
Thus resolution mechanics that seem to be "scene" mechanics really depend on the outcome narration as to which they actually are in application.<br/>

That makes sense (even if it's relevant to the personal style of play). I think the difference regarding to immersion between columns <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, first row, is pretty much a learned and cultural thing.<br><br>I'm sitting pretty firmly in the upper left box, unless I can imagine a row above that with granularity of, I dunno, Organic or Freeform?

I think we mean different things; I mean organic in a sense that it resembles human interaction as closely as possible - "scenes" tend to be very long, because they mostly consist of dialogue (and description of physical activities) and time flow pretty much follows the flow of real time (or slower, because everything has to be described verbally). There are no scene changes as such, rather skipping over parts which are not intresting - that would be, sleeping through a journey or something else just not happening. <br/><br/>I think it's best explained by comparing it with LARP. In LARP, real time and game time matches because of the physical reality - you do stuff and you speak, like you would outside a game. The immersive play style around here pretty much shares the same ideals and is heavily influenced by LARPing; the match is not one one one, because the lack of physical correspondency gives you some freedom of movement. That freedom is used if necessary; if not, the actual play is pretty much the same, except that physical activity is replaced by either description or resolution. And of course the freedom to potray things that could not be achieved in physical reality, like superpowers - this is where we start coming down to visit box the boxes in first row.<br/><br/>Opaqueness (it's hardly ever total and is in any case dictated by whatever is prepared before the play - if a character is desrcibed to be strong as a bull, he is, which is a kind of a resolution in itself) comes from the same place. Majority of LARPs lack a resolution system or have a very simple one. Thus the players have pretty much learned to live without one and rely on their own judgement of what happens (is that a "player fiat"?). GM resolves interaction with things other than players, if needed, because unlike LARPs, tabletop play needs NPC's and imagined physical reality. Again, visits to first row, if needed. Depends, really, on the amount and scale of physical activity.<br/><br/>(And I realize I'm now derailing badly, so we could split from this thread, if needed)                        </div>

Nah, this is important.  Here's how I'd fit your description of LARPing into my grid:<br/><br/>Whenever you engage the resolution system (of player fiat or GM determination) you're resolving *specific actions*, e.g., "I'm trying to knock this guy out; he doesn't want me to."  That's a task.  Note that the granularity of resolution axis only talks about the "single unit" scope of play that's getting resolved in a single iteration of the resolution system.  In your LARP, you're never resolving an entire scene with a single iteration of player or GM fiat, right?  It's individual actions.<br/><br/>... which is pretty light-shedding for me.  I'd totally failed to consider that LARP falls into the Opaque Tasks intersection on the grid.  Though one could argue that you could at least go to Clear Tasks in a LARP -- for example, when that GM walks over to arbitrate the fisticuffs, it might help to be clear about your intents, since the GM might not've been around to experience the context in which the fisticuffs arose.<br/><br/>At least based on my experience GMing large games (which are equivalent to "small larps") at AmberCon Northwest, we're totally in 'Tasks' space, and whenever I encounter a player being Opaque to me, I at least try to encourage them to be Clear (and at times, in determining what happens due to their action, I shade into making those intents Relevant).<br/><br/>Dig?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite><br/>Whenever you engage the resolution system (of player fiat or GM determination) you're resolving *specific actions*, e.g., "I'm trying to knock this guy out; he doesn't want me to."  That's a task.  Note that the granularity of resolution axis only talks about the "single unit" scope of play that's getting resolved in a single iteration of the resolution system.  In your LARP, you're never resolving an entire scene with a single iteration of player or GM fiat, right?  It's individual actions.<br/><br/>... which is pretty light-shedding for me.  I'd totally failed to consider that LARP falls into the Opaque Tasks intersection on the grid.  Though one could argue that you could at least go to Clear Tasks in a LARP -- for example, when that GM walks over to arbitrate the fisticuffs, it might help to be clear about your intents, since the GM might not've been around to experience the context in which the fisticuffs arose.</blockquote>
I think that could be said, yes. The task-part is usually kind of muddy because of the lack of resolution system, though. If there is one, it usually works with quite simple number comparison or similar - I'm better fighter than you are, so I kick your ass, let's act out the results (would that be a task or conflict?). If there isn't one, it's based on acting and player fiat - someone hits you (well, acts like he's hitting or punches lightly), you as a receiving end decide what happens, based on what you know about your character, the opposing character and the situation.<br/><br/>If GM arbitrates then yes, I think that could be considered to be a task or conflict as well, depending on the case. These occasions are few and far between, though - the GM's stay out of the play or out of the GM role if possible, because GM arbitration always breaks the play and the immersion. The notable exception is when player is interacting with something that's not modelled - like making a phonecall to the airport to reserve flight tickets. Or if there is something that's just too complicated to simulate, like the often mentioned safe. That would certainly be a task, with player either comparing some kind value to target number or performing some kind of acting-like task that he's been instructed to simulate the safe cracking. Handcuffs are handcuffs or something that emulate handcuffs, like tape or something - if you can do it with physical props, that's the first choice.<br/><br/>But the main rule, so to speak, is that there are as few resolutions as possible, with the exception of stuff that cannot be simulated. Hence the opaqueness and lack of clearness; there are no clear intentions as such, because the play fervently tries to steer away from such abstractions. For a more task-oriented LARP schema, see any Minds Eye Theatre LARP rules, which certainly fall into the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> box (and are something of an bad example which originally led to freeform, no-resolution LARPs). <br/><br/>There's not much stuff around the web in English about the subject, but you might want to take a look at the <a href="http://weltschmerz.laiv.org/europa/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Europa-larp's homepage</a> and the guides in there in order to get a more complete picture.<br/><br/><i>Edit: To clarify, there different styles of conventions of LARPing around here, of course - I'm an old school immersive player, whereas some people are experimenting with fate-play and other techiques, which might map differently to the picture.</i> </div>

I'd guess it could be called unstructured drama; if a character has clear goals (you want to resolve the unresolved issues with the woman you're romantically involved with and escape with her) or the player comes up with goals during the play, the situtation at the end of the game has several plausible and intresting outcomes. The timespan to achieve the results is just longer. There could be clear goals, there could be possible goals (you either don't know them at the beginning of the game or you have intentions and wants that could turn into goals and conflicts during the game), or the goals are directly tied to the theme of the game (see Europa; you're a refuge, try to manage).                        </div>

                            Yep, Fred has nailed it. Although (possibly with Merten) I would also stress that Opaque vs. Clear is a continuum...and not only that, but<br/><br/>a) methods of signaling intent vary, from person to person and instance to instance, in terms of clarity.<br/>b) methods of signaling intent vary, from person to person and instance to instance, in terms of the need to consciously formulate and receive them.<br/><br/>Communities of Practice (paging Jonathan Walton!), i.e., people who've become accustomed to working together, tend to be better at signaling intent than complete strangers. I mean that they're more capable of signaling intent without having to resort to overt or formal signals.<br/><br/>Finally, while column 3 in Fred's chart obviously guarantees that the player's intent won't be arbitrarily voided (at least once the conflict has been defined), columns 1 &amp; 2 don't amount to "the GM runs everything" unless you add one more ingredient: the GM has decided to run everything.                        </div>

Excellent question. We certainly run into problems with situations like "So, Mr. Composer, how does that one part in Beethoven's Symphone no 1 go?", if the player just doesen't know. He could improvise and just come up with something and the questioner might believe him if he's wishes so (plays along collaboratively, believing that the character just gave an plausible explanation) - or trouble comes. The player might step momentarily to out-of-character mode and just say that the character knows and he doesen't, but that's ankward. With physical tasks that just cannot be performed, both players probably drop out to the ooc-mode and go through the task by talking (or using resolution, if available). With emotional issues, like very sudden and alien situations, the player probably just acts based on instinct - we discussed about this recently elsewhere and a good point about not having secrets was raised; it could be easier to prepare to these situations if the player knows about them beforehand; the reaction is more that of an character than just gut instinct of a player.<br/><br/>So yes, there certainly are limitations and situtations where you just have to improvise outside the context of the character. The GM can prepare for some of these and seek to eliminate things that could prove troublesome, if he wants to or realizes them. The mechanic for these situtations is usually collaborative discussion between players, instead of using resolution mechanics as such. And there are plenty of other possible problems which could arise as well, the most common one being that players have received contradicting background information that's not intentional.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>Finally, while column 3 in Fred's chart obviously guarantees that the player's intent won't be arbitrarily voided (at least once the conflict has been defined), columns 1 &amp; 2 don't amount to "the GM runs everything" unless you add one more ingredient: the GM has decided to run everything.</blockquote>
Column One most certainly does. All resolution - all decisions that are not foregone conclusions - are in the hands of the GM's interpretation. No matter how good my heart and how pure my intentions, I am the one making all the decisions that actually matter. IN order for that not to be the case, you have to get at least partly over to column 2. The less opacity, the more the GM is <i>able</i> to share authority. A GM with the best will in the world can't genuinely share authority with players unless signals of intent are getting through at least a little. If I don't know what my players are trying to accomplish by their actions, I can't decide whether it works in a reliable and fair way.<br/><br/>This is not to deny the feasibility (and fun!) of play like you or Merten describe - fully mimetic, with no engagement of structured resolution except in edge cases where mimetic resolution is impossible. That kind of play works because NOBODY has authority except when mimesis breaks down. I rather like freeform, actually, but it can't deliver good results for me in (a) the genres I prefer and (b) situations where player interests are divergent.                        </div>

<p>Well, awesome!</p>
<p>I want to say here that Fred's revelations, whatever their origins, are identical to the conclusions of the Forge in this matter. He's using clearer terminology (having come at it from a different, and coincidentally more intuitive angle), but he's saying <em>exactly the same thing</em> and Vincent et al. I think he understands this because he understands the process of play very well and as a result, he understands RPG design very well.</p>

                            Well, while I think that nobody in the original discussions on this subject on The Forge would disagree that the two axes that Fred is describing exist, I'm not sure we ever too the time to look at what the cross-referenced portions looked like individually, or what they imply.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this Forgie would like to point out a few things. For one, I have an even more moderate stance on the idea that playing to intent is "healthier." I would rather put it that playing without any reference to intent means that play is more difficult, and, therefore perhaps more prone to problems. But if a group is good at this sort of play, they can certainly have "healthy" play - lots of groups do. There are also certain potential issues with explicating intent that the intent-driven sorts of play have that the non-intent driven resolution doesn't have. (Like if players aren't honest about intent, for instance).<br/>
<br/>
Further, while Fred is correct in categorizing PTA in the lower right hand corner, I would say that most of the "indie" set is actually ambiguously between the second and third columns, and ambiguous as to how much action is resolved as well. Especially in certain cases like TSOY, or HQ, where there are specific rules to take what Fred would call "Scene" resolution, and break it down into "Task" resolution (Bringing Down the Pain for TSOY, and Extended Contests for HQ).<br/>
<br/>
Now, Fred could say that these are just example of "partitioned scene resolution" or something, but then so is any combat system - HP being the meter by which we determine whether or not the combat is resolved. If you exempt D&amp;D from this, because one can duck out at any time, I'd point out that FATE actually is more like HQ than it is like D&amp;D in this regard, and that all three systems actually have room to change intent in the course of the overall action.<br/>
<br/>
Further muddying the waters are contests for very short actions. If they're not further broken down, are they "Scene Resolution"? Like, for instance, a character is trying to fire an arrow to hit a bullseye. The player just wants to display the character's skill, say. How would that be broken down into smaller parts? What purpose would that detail serve?<br/>
<br/>
I think that what Fred is saying is that some systems do not allow for finer detail if warranted. Like PTA, or MLWM. But I'd say that these sorts of systems are actually pretty rare.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that said, given a system that allows for either of Fred's categories to occur, what you'll often see is that some groups will tend to drift to using a lot more "scene" resolution, discriminating against the sort of detailed action that they may have found dull in playing other systems previously. Combat being the obvious example, many people who have found D&amp;D combat dull in the past will often decide to resolve larger chunks of action with but one roll. So you do get groups where a lot of this goes on.<br/>
<br/>
My groups tend to go in this direction, for instance. I use Extended Contests in HQ only rarely (especially in IRC, where speed is valued a lot).<br/>
<br/>
But this is an advantage of these systems that the question of whether or not to go with "task" or "scene" here is one of taste and relative to the action happening in-game. The participants can actively make the decision. There are just as many groups out there playing HQ that use an Extended Contest every time there is a combat. TSOY's Bringing Down the Pain has explicit rules for determining when a player might activate using this break-down of the action.<br/>
<br/>
FATE 2.0 has three systems from which to choose from, giving three levels of granularity for resolving these sorts of actions.<br/>
<br/>
Other games in the "indie set" are actually explicitly about tasks alone. Like Donjon, where getting through a fight is all about the small individual steps (and what those steps empower the players to create in terms of action). Burning Wheel is about breaking down things like Duels of Wits into actual "Scripted" events. Dogs in the Vinyard requires break down of overall resolution into tasks (including the escallation from one sort of conflict to another).<br/>
<br/>
Many others, however, are pretty silent on the subject. Dust Devils, for instance looks at the gunfight as the primary example of resolution, which is over in one "draw." But I've seen fights get dragged out into series of contests before as well.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on with examples. I think that the Indie Set has been quite cognizant of these issues, and that, in fact, where you do see limitations on these things, they've been important parts of the specific designs instead of some sort of statement that the "scene" lenght of conflict is superior. When it's not important to the design, either it's ambiguous, or the design specifically gives the user the option of which level to use.<br/>
<br/>
What's more accurate to say is that most of these games move from the left column to ones further right. Here, again, I'd say that most of them actaully go only to the middle column. It's been Ron's contention and mine, for a while now that, in fact, people take things to the far right column too often. He and I have been pointing out to people for a while now how "presetting stakes" is simply not neccessary, and can be damaging to drama - questions of immersion aside. Trollbabe, for instance, is firmly also in the "Scene" row, in that it has a very simple resolution system that is intended to run things to their conclusion without any break-down into details. But, as Ron points out, the players state character goals. He uses the term "Stakes" in the book, but this term has aquired a different meaning from that he uses in his book in the general discussions about it, and does not mean what he means (which is clear if you read his text and examples).<br/>
<br/>
I know people who advocate that you can't play HQ successfully unless you pre-set stakes - meaning player intent affects outcome as you state in the third column. But my play of the game shows that this is not true. I'm constantly surprising players with the actual outcomes of HQ contests, while still respecting the character goal statements.<br/>
<br/>
So I think that there's more agreement here than not. Those who have gone over to the radical right lower corner are either doing so for specific design reasons in design. Or as groups as a reaction to the upper left hand corner - and such reaction isn't proof of anything. Where the decision is more reasoned, I think there's quite a lot of consensus on this subject.<br/>

                            P.S. Actually Donjon is an interesting case. In that the players decide what the results of their actions are, player intent is king. But the system actually forces those results to come from very distinct in-game character actions. That is, since they only narrate on success, yes, they can create the papers in the safe. But they can't engineer a failure where the result is that a weight fell on the safe, preventing them from opening it, as it's the GM's job to narrate failures. The GM could do this, but then it has nothing to do with player intent. And just as often, the GM will simply say, "You fail to get the safe open." It's on the player in Donjon to engineer victories, and drive the story forward.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that this probably does void the specific "immersion" line where players are agents to control outside events. But it doesn't cross the "in-game continuity" line that says that resolution results must be within the bounds of what the in-game character ability could produce. That is the ability itself doesn't become metagame.<br/>
<br/>
So there's clearly two lines here that can be crossed. I personally don't mind crossing the "immersion line" and creating things as a player (especially when I can think of them as simply suggestions to the GM who, in vetting them, can be said to be doing the actual creation). But I do have a problem, personally, with making abilities entirely metagame, and saying, for example, that failures are not a failure of the character to use the ability well, but completely of circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
In part this is because there's always a better in-game explanation. No, I don't think that you should describe a low roll as the character acting with less skill than the sheet says they have. A trained safe-cracker suddenly becoming a bumbling stooge is just as implausible as if their failure is caused by the sudden arrival of ninjas. The plausible in-game solution to the problem is to say that a low die roll means that circumstances on the micro-level are such that the character is not able to employ his skill well enough to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
With the safe-cracker, it may turn out that he's simply never seen this particular model of safe before. That makes it so that the safe-cracker can't succeed, but doesn't make him suddenly incompetent. Or some bit of equipment he's using might decide right at that moment to break, causing a jam in the mechanism. Or, if the goal is to get the safe open before detected, the guard simply randomly decided to look into this room sooner than expected.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to look at the system as resolving in-game action based on in-game inputs, then you have to consider what the dice represent. Why does a character hit another one round, and not the next? Why is it not deterministic?<br/>
<br/>
The dice represent the random minutia of the universe that we don't account for with the system. Sure, we could keep track of which decision the character makes in terms of where he's holding his sword - TROS does. But if that's not a level of detail that we consider important in the design in question, then we can say that the dice mean that the character guessed to defend up high, when his opponent's blow came down low. Or any other of the myriad details available.<br/>
<br/>
That's not to say that others don't enjoy using the abilities entirely as metagame (again, like people who like task without intent, these are just preferences). What I'm pointing out is that there are many axes that affect how resolution is carried out.<br/>

                            Ho ho ho, yeah, Forge "secret word" jargon laffo. Just pretend I put a nasty joke there. lol.<br>
<br>
Since others won't, I will!<br>
<br>
d20 combat: Because the number of possible outcomes is pretty limited, there's only a few choices at any given moment. You're either looking to defeat the opponent lethally, nonlethally, or you're looking to get away.  Other intents are irrelevant or ignored. There are a couple of decent morale systems that expand on this threefold (hyuk hyuk) possibility with others. Because what you're after in a fight doesn't matter to resolving the fight unless it impacts one of those three choices, it shifts very naturally between opaque and clear.  It's fairly solidly at the "task"end of that axis, but it should be noted that the system does not attempt to model each individual swing of each individual sword. It aggregates them into a three-second round, so it's not at the top (if anything is.)<br>
<br>
d20 non-combat: Varies considerably. Social skills like Diplomacy, Bluff, and Disguise absolutely require the player to clearly state their intent, because they aggregate extensive social exchanges.  Diplomacy, for instance (http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/diplomacy.htm) lists possible actions that you could be steering the NPC towards: "I want this guy to help us out but he doesn't have to put himself on the line, just give us information".  That's a clear intent and from the chart, it indicates you need to get him to Friendly.  Still, with physical skills like Climb and Swim, the intent doesn't matter - from my experience the intent is ofen just "find out what happens when I climb this cliff" but of course not always.  Still hovers in the "task" area <br>
<br>
Put on your helmets to protect from brain damage: Vampire! We'll take Second Edition, the edition MOST HATED by all right thinking people (laffo, lol, etc.) Not surprisingly, it's fairly similar to the traditional play described above, but it also incorporated quite a few scene-based resolution mechanics. Most significantly, there was a "hunting" system that would resolve hours of searching for someone to drink blood from quickly if the group didn't want to get bogged down with individual hunting scenes for everyone. There was also a seduction system and a system for social interaction in highly stylized environments.  Several systems would "overlay" a scene, by giving the player who used them additional information or assistance in the scene if they used them successfully.  As for intent? Again, intent was mandatory to even activate these systems. ("Damn, I am low on blood, I'll be back in a couple of hours guys.") However, again, a fair amount of intent was irrelevant. ("I'm using my heightened senses because I think the hot chick in the push up corset is lying to me." "Whatever, roll the dice, I'll tell you if you are able to tell if she's lying when we're done.") So while the system rewarded having broad, plan-oriented intents, you didn't have to tell anyone what your intent was past your semi-immediate goal.  There were some resolution consequences for intent in some of the systems too - finding someone to willingly be fed from was harder and different than just finding some dude passed out in an alleyway and feeding from them. So the player whose intent was "Gonna go feed, but I don't want my aching heart to break from the tragedy of my existence so I'll find someone broken enough to feed from willingly." did different stuff in the system than the player whose intent was "I'm a monster, I hide in dark places and jump out at people after they've already been scared by their cat."<br>
<br>
Later today I'm going to destroy everything you tried to create (lol, laffo): with Toon!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

FWIW, all the Diplomacy skill does is alter the NPC's disposition. It in no way ensures an outcome or achievement of intent. Whether disposition = your intent is up to the DM. Intimidate works pretty much the same way.<br><br>Bluff is more specific, in that it resolves whether the target reacts the way you want them to or believes something you want them to.<br><br>Disguise just resolves whether the target's Spot blows your disguise or not.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm not quite sure what JD is getting at, either (am I the "you" referenced in your post? Or Fred? Or...). But if it's that Vampire is further right on the chart than D&amp;D, and that D&amp;D could be further left...I'm in agreement with him on that. Phoenix Command, for example, is probably further up and left than D&amp;D in terms of what it promotes.<br/>
<br/>
Note that "task" as Fred has it can't mean "smallest atomic action imaginable" or something (one could imagine, in fact, working out the motion of the sub-atomic particles, or even quark interactions or something). It merely means that you resolve some part of the character action instead of going straight to the outcome intent.<br/>

<br>
Actually the D20/Vampire analysis is meant to fit into the grid, in the same way as Mike fit in a bunch of indie games onto it.<br>
<br>
I love the Forge (it's hilarious!), that's why I kid and why I am not bothered by the accusations of HATORZing.<br>
<br>
I think Toon, and maybe Paranoia, are going to destroy the grid, but I may be surprised to find out I'm wrong when I get to analyzing it!<br>
<br>
Now on to content. I guess I'm still confused by the statement that Diplomacy doesn't require you to state your intent, or at least that it's requires players to be clearer in their intent than combat is (where your intent is irrelevant except insofar as it affects lethal victory, nonlethal victory, or withdrawal), there's explicit categories to which the player must assign his intent...I suppose outside those categories intent doesn't matter, still, but as the grid teaches, at some point that's true of every game. (DitV player: "I'm Giving because I fucking hate player C...and the Forge!!!" Player C and the Forge: "Whatever.") If the DM is playing according to the rules, he can't have a NPC whose disposition is at the appropriate level act against the stated intent just because he feels like having the NPC do that.  So, no, it's not up to them. If I say "I want this guy to help" and I get him to the "willing to help" level on the chart with Diplomacy, then he helps or the rule's being broken.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Sure the GM can. All he has to do say "Yeah, well this guy is FRIENDLY. But he doesn't KNOW anything. So, he's useless to you. Better luck next time sucker ... " And, there's nothing I know if in the rules that prevents the GM from doing this any time he likes. Sure, the GM could have painted himself into a corner by previously setting up some context that logically requires the "Diplomacied" guy to talk, but none of that is D&amp;D by the book, as far as I know it.                        </div>

Jason, the sticky bit is that Diplomacy says nothing about the PC getting what they want. All the skill does is shift the NPC's attitude on the disposition scale. The degree of shift depends on your roll.<br><br>The problem is, that shift doesn't necessarily mean that the NPC does what you asked. I.e., nothing about the roll insures that. Sure, the DM is assumed to have the NPC act within their new disposition, but what exactly that means in a given situation is left up to them, or at least some DM-player negotiation. E.g., does the fact my dwarf cleric shifted a drow prisoner to Helpful mean that he'll draw me a map of the drow stronghold with all the cool treasure marked? I dunno. A generous DM might say, "Sure." A more conservative one might say it doesn't matter how good my check was; the drow hates all dwarves and will not assist them in any way. "Helpful" in this DM's case means, "Will not try to escape, or at least won't slit the party's throats when he does."<br><br>Ergo, while it's good for me to state my intent, it's not related in any specific way to the roll. The roll does not resolve my intent.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm saying that, AS WRITTEN (or at least as I understand the text), it's entirely plausible that the D&amp;D Dungeon Master can indeed determine rightness or wrongness of a person at his whim. There is no rule, and precious little, if any, play advice that prevents this. <br><br>Might there be some other understanding that prevents this from happening in someone's group? Certainly. In fact, I'd guess it's probably more common than the strangeness I'm suggesting. <br><br>I'll try to use a specific example that makes more sense: <br><br>Your character investigates some urban fantasy sewer murder mystery. Pretty bog-standard D&amp;D stuff. Let's say some wererats are killing people, and you're going after them. <br><br>Early in the adventure, you and your players go to a dock-side tavern, seeking some information. Spontaneously, you ask the GM "Ok, I find some guy who looks like he's from this town and I ask him if he has any information. I want him point us at the best way to access the sewer tunnels."<br><br>The GM responds, "Um, ok. Roll Diplomacy."<br><br>You roll, quite well, and the GM further explains, by the book. "Ok, this guy was Indifferent to you. That means he affords only social norms to you, like nodding when you nod and stuff. But, you were successful on your roll, and now he's Friendly. Now, the book says he'll 'Chat, advise, offer limited help, advocate.' "<br><br>"Great!" you reply. "I want him to offer limited help." <br><br/>"Well, he's just a bloke. He doesn't really know anything about the sewers. He's just a tanner. I rolled it up right here." (points to some old chart he likes to use for NPCs.) "So, he says you should ask around about that."<br/><br/>"What? That's what I'm doing. I told you clear as day I wanted him to help with the sewers. Why did I roll, then?"<br/><br/>"Sorry man, you were clear, but just because you ask me doesn't mean every guy in town knows stuff about the sewers. I'm just playing realistically. In this city I created, I want it to seem alive. Just because the Skill rules say that doesn't mean everyone's a sewer guildsman all the sudden. What do you think this is, some short-bus Forge game." (Obviously, everyone thinks he is hilarious.)<br/><br/>"Ok fine, let's do it again after I find a sewer guildsman."<br/><br/>"Well, sure, but even if you make one Friendly, it doesn't mean they know anything about the wererats."<br/><br/>(raises hand) "CHECK PLEASE!"                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Seems more like the realm of Gather Information, Matt.

                            Ok, the particular piece was Gather Information. And, while Buzz says the point stands, it's up to other readers to decide whether I have a point. I'm not trying to argue my dogma, I'm trying to sort it out in these recent threads. <br/><br/>I <i>think</i> the point stands; it demonstrates some possibiltiies, anyway. If we change it from "ask the guy where to get into the sewers" to "ask the guy to lead us in to the sewers" I think it still makes plenty o' Diplomacy sense.<br/><br/>For example, with that intent (ask the guy to lead us) the GM can rightly say: "Ok, he's freindly now, maybe even willing to help. ... but he has no idea where to go." <br/><br/>Yes, there are TEXTUAL ways around this particular problem (request a Gather Info. roll, then follow up with a Diplomacy roll, if needed). But, even then, there are non-textual ways a trick GM can get around it. For example: "Ok, you find the guy who would lead you to the sewers ... but he's Unfriendly. Even if you succed, he'll only be Indifferent."                        </div>

The hard part of this discussion is that we also have to deal with the goofiness of D&amp;D's Diplomacy rules. It's entirely possible for a PC with a good Diplomacy to, by the book, shift an NPC from Hostile to Friendly or even Helpful. <br/><br/>I've been in the dwarf/drow situation I outlined above. As a DM, it was very difficult for me to go with the roll, or even allow the roll in the first place, as it just made so little sense. However, the drow wasn't going anywhere, so all he could do was listen. Ergo, I allowed the check, and, *bing*, Helpful drow. <br/><br/>Of course, the fact that the awesome check didn't force me to agree to anything other than the drow's shift in disposition. The players couldn't make him do anything I didn't want him to do.                        </div>

                            Yes, yes, I'm not quite that dense, I got all that.  My issue is this: I don't see how this makes player intent irrelevant. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, these examples seem to make player intent highly relevant - otherwise, who the fuck cares that the idiot GM ignored it? In order for the system to function at all, you have to take player intent into account.  Otherwise you reach these horrible examples of crummy GMing.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could reach the conclusion that D&amp;D is totally unplayable but the empirical evidence suggests otherwise.<br/>

Maybe I am using a too legalistic idea of what's relevant and irrelevant. If I introduce a document in a child neglect case that shows a parent is using drugs, and the other side objects and says, "It's irrelevant!", that's not the right objection, it's highly relevant - it just happens to be unfavorable.  Similarly, if a GM ignores player intent in D20 when applying the Diplomacy rules, saying "it's irrelevant!" they're just flat wrong and nobody should be surprised when they run into a brick wall.                        </div>

The notion of 'Relevant' as regards the statements of player intent are not based on whether the intents are relevant; it's based on whether they are <i>given relevance</i> by being factored into play.  If they were not factored into play, then it can be observed that the intents were <i>not relevant</i> to the making of the decisions pushing play forward.                        </div>

<br/>
It is definitely possible to be an idiot and read "Helpful" to mean "Unhelpful" and refuse to factor intent in D20 diplomacy into play. But of course you could do that with any system where intent was relevant.  The example of an idiot refusing to do something doesn't prove that it should not be done.<br/>
<br/>
I'm assuming the rest of my examples were uncontroversial?<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Matt, I got what you were saying too, first, as I state here, I don't think it proves anything because morons can fuck whatever system you give them in the ear, second, I don't think it's "following the rules" to say that helpful means unhelpful.<br/>
<br/>
Am I saying that the Diplomacy system in D20 is at the far right hand side of the chart? No. You don't get any bonuses or penalties to using the system depending on what your intent is. Either you shift the NPC's disposition to where it needs to be or you don't. But it is flat out dead on wrong to say it's at the far left hand side of the chart with the combat system. The system requires you to state your intent and it requires the GM to take that intent into consideration and try to fit it into a fairly big chunk of categories when setting a DC.<br/>
<br/>
I am in fact baffled that the idea stirs such resistance. WTF?                        </div>

This is starting to sound like the ENworld discussion about fiat, i.e., "That's just bad DM'ing." <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think all that Matt and I are saying is that the D&amp;D system doesn't mandate anything other than the top-left corner of Fred's diagram. Diplomacy doesn't address <em>why</em> the player is making the check, other than "to make the NPC like my PC." It doesn't insure any outcome other than the disposition shift.<br/><br/>Yeah, a good DM should hopefully have the player's intentions in mind (the center column of Fred's diagram), but that's in the realm of talking about play, not about the system itself. Mechanically, there's nothing there forcing intent to be part of the equation. I mean, look at the SRD entry for the skill; there are no modifiers that reflect <em>what it is you're asking the target to do</em>. That doesn't even factor in until <em>after</em> the check is made. "Okay, now the NPC is Helpful. Let's see if what you're asking him falls under the definition of Helpful."<br/><br/>Again, Diplomacy is one of the fuzziest areas of D&amp;D. This either makes it very relevant to this discussion or irrelevant. I dunno which. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

To reiterate my point w/r/t the above: D&amp;D <em>absolutely does not in any way require</em> the player to state an intent before making a Diplomacy check. "Do I change his disposition?" is the only thing that Diplomacy resolves (as well as advantage in certain opposed negotiating circumstances).                        </div>

                            Hm, good point about the timeline, buzz.  What I was trying to get at was this: The player's intent certainly does matter before the results are factored into play, no matter whether they're expressed before or after the die roll (and as I note, they don't have any impact on the die roll itself, so we're definitely not in the far right hand column.)  The quote you give, "Let's see if what you're asking falls under the definition of Helpful" is part of that process, and I see it as part of the resolution of the Diplomacy system.  (Otherwise it's just rolling a die for no reason at all and it can have no impact on play.)<br/>
<br/>
Matt, just reverse it and you've got it. The GM is being a shmuck because he's cheating when he sees the word "helpful" as "not helpful".  Maybe if I reversed the order in which I said what I said it would make things clearer: 1 - you're giving an example of someone clearly breaking the rule, and 2 - I don't know that any resolution system could ever pass the "give this system to a fucking idiot" test and I don't think we can learn anything from it.                        </div>

                            As I've suggested elsewhere, it's possible we're seeing a clash of expectations. On one hand you have people whose experience with bad scenario construction and GMing advice has led them to believe that ignoring the intent of player action (whether clear or implied), and also ignoring the natural consequence of events, isn't just a technique layered on top of "task resolution", but part and parcel of same. On the other side you have people whose experience says otherwise. Of the two I side with the latter. Nobody denies that a GM with enough discretionary power can control the narrative. But the claim I see being made (on page one of this discussion for example) is that unless the GM is obliged to allow the player to pre-narrate at least one possible outcome, that means the GM will necessarily control the story. And that just isn't universally so. It requires a specific philosophy of GMing.                        </div>

                            Buzz is saying what I was going to say.<br/><br/>First, let's toss this "That's just bad GM'ing" noise out on its ear. OF COURSE bad GMing by someone being an obstinate jackass isn't really worth discussing. It's just ... bad.<br/><br/>The problem here, as I see it, is judging whether this is bad GMing. <br/><br/>If this were functional, illusionist play, then it seems to me as not bad GMing? It's just play in which meaningful decisions and conflicts are, in fact, determined by the GM. <br/><br/>If you (or I) don't PREFER those types of games, does that make them automatically bad GMing? Because I find that explanation -- that we don't like that style -- more plausible than any indication that the D&amp;D text "by the book" doesn't support my example.<br/><br/>To be clear, I DON'T LIKE that style of play. But I recognize no piece of text in the D&amp;D books that indicates this is cheating. I'm no expert. Perhaps such text exists. I would very much like to know that if it does. <br/><br/>So, can you point that out? Is the whole of your argument about this that I shouldn't read the word "Helpful" as "Unhelpful"? Because, that's not especially clear stuff. There is no text indicating how we recognize verbal procedures, declaration (and resolution) of intents or anything else. At least on Diplomacy alone, it just says you move NPCs reactions from one state to another with a particular role. It does not say "and thus the players get what they want out of it." Heck, it doesn't even say "And thus the GM can't say no about, say, enemies lending aid. They just have to, GM, your adventure be damned." All it does say, as Buzz pointed out, is that they go from this state to that one, and here's a pretty vague explanation of what that state is. There's no indication of how long it lasts or what risks are acceptable, for example.<br/><br/>So, I'm confused how you read my examples as cheating by way of being a jerk. Can you convince me (assuing you're interested in doing so, and you obviously ain't required!) how my examples are such, using the text of D&amp;D?                        </div>

<blockquote>It requires a specific philosophy of GMing.</blockquote>
Eliot, that's pretty much what I'm trying to say (awfully). Let me try (god help me!) to put it another way: <br/><br/>I am dicussing with Jason about whether the D&amp;D GM is cheating or not. I say he's not, because he's playing "By the book" D&amp;D. This is a trick.<br/><br/>In fact, there are dozens, if not infinite, possible ways to play "by the book" D&amp;D that are RADICALLY different (as in, so different two groups would hate each other's play styles).<br/><br/>Why? Because the D&amp;D rules text is frequently silent on what Paul Czege calls "social architecture" of the game. There just isn't any text I recognize that mandates "by the book" how a group of people fulfill declaration and resolution of actions for many types of situations. <br/><br/>Who gets to say what, and when do they get to say it? <br/><br/>D&amp;D does explain this <i>for certain kinds of situations</i> like combat, spell effects, and some others. But, it's pretty awful in explaining how, say, one convinces an army to defend another kingdom. Is that a Diplomacy roll? Several of them? Does one require magic? How does that work? Can you just Dominate the king? How long with the army fight? What will make them NOT go fight? Does this one roll decide, and if it does is that the end of it? Can players just declare they want to roll, or do they have to wait their turn? Does the GM just decide once the players beat up enough baddies? How does he "measure" their influence and renown? Does he need to? How many times can the players ask to do that? Etc. <br/><br/>So, groups play. They read the text. But, by and large, they're left on their own to come to some kind of mutual understanding about how one resolves such situations. <br/><br/>The problem is that many people assume THEIR solution to this silent text "is D&amp;D." It's no such thing. It's YOUR D&amp;D. But, it may or may not be mine. The D&amp;D text is nearly useless for these kinds of situations. So, unsurprisingly, people leave it to the GM's almighty judgment. Or, the cobble together some skill rolls in such-and-such a way. Or whatever. They use the D&amp;D text as a guideline, but then again so does the other group whose play style you think stinks.<br/><br/>This is an example of the clash of expectations you're seeing. It's not just in D&amp;D, obviously. People actually argue with each other that one group's solution to their expectations is "bad GMing." Based on what? Their own preference? The silent text? Just, what?                        </div>

                            (cross-posted with Matt's post--which is why this comes out as not responding to it)<br/><br/>Matt--<br/><br/>for "bad GMing", read "illusionist GMing". You are claiming that if the players don't get to pre-narrate at least one possible outcome, but instead rely entirely on the goodwill of the GM, then the GM will end up "telling the story".<br/><br/>Nope. Only if the GM decides to tell the story, does the GM tell the story.<br/><br/>The difference, over in the right hand column of Fred's chart, is that if the GM decides to tell the story, it becomes a heck of a lot clearer a heck of a lot faster, than if the player doesn't get to pre-narrate at least one possible outcome. Why? Because then the GM has to peremptorily exclude certain possibilities before the dice even hit the table, or openly slice &amp; dice the framing of "subgoals" on the way to realizing the player's intent.                        </div>

I'm claiming that? Huh, that's weird. I thought I was claiming that "if the GM decides to tell the story, then he tells a story." Are we actually disagreeing here?

                            Well, obviously it's possible for D&amp;D to have been more specific about what "helpful" means. Of course then they could be more specific about their definition, and more specific about that, and so on and so on, it's turtles all the way down. To me, helpful is a pretty useful, general term, which - I presume - is what they wanted.  At least that's what they wrote.  Maybe that's another aspect - granularity of intent, no matter how clear it is required to be.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why D20 would be required (?) to say "if the players shift their characters' enemies to being helpful via these rules, you throw your plot out, GM! Boo yah!"  It seems obvious to me that the rules intend to allow the possibility of making enemies helpful because...they do. I don't know why that's so shockingly horrifyingly shocking McShocking that the lack of a "but we don't really mean it" must be an omission of ignorance instead of intent.<br/>
<br/>
The big list of questions Matt asks involving the army situation are areas not covered by Diplomacy, I agree, but that's a giant "who cares?" to me. I was just classifying the D20 resolution systems we had, not claiming that D20 covered every possible play situation with equal detail. (In fact I think I said specifically in my first post that it didn't.) Red herring.<br/>
<br/>
As far as "verbal procedures" in the text, I don't have the actual book to hand and it's not open content so there's no link to it online, but I seem to remember the usual "players say what they intend to do and the GM adjudicates" text...is that what you mean? I am at a loss as to how this applies to where on the task-scene/opaque-clear-weighty intent axes a system belongs?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, if I go home tonight and am astounded to find for the first time that a player must blow into a whistle to interrupt a GM's description and announce their intent, followed by a vote of the players on whether they get a roll or not, does that affect factornig intent into a Diplomacy check if the skill rules don't change? I don't think it does but I'm open to being convinced otherwise.                        </div>

Eliot, what the heck are you talking about, exactly? I have no idea what you're saying at all. <br/><br/>I have not said those literal quotes as far as I can tell. Have I missed them? So, I presume that you're interpreting those quotes from my text somehow? I don't know how, because I don't think it's there. Have I contradicted myself? I'm not seeing it. Can you be more specific?<br/><br/>To clarify, I agree that Task Resolution (as the Forge has used it, not Fred) means the GM runs everything. By Vincent Baker's excellent explanation I quoted much earlier, I agree with that. I am very unclear where I have suggested something contradictory AND maintained that it was Task Resolution (again, using the "old" Forge definition of that word).<br/><br/>Please help sort out my confusion! I'm completely missing your examination.                        </div>

                            The first quote is what you wrote--actually what you attributed to a notional smart person. Click the link. The second quote is what I'm saying, and you say you agree with me. At least, based on my subtle skills of interpretation that's what I take from the last couple posts you've addressed to me.<br/><br/>I was actually cutting you some slack in your use of Vincent's quote; he wrote that task resolution "puts the GM in a position of priviledged authorship". If you believe that means "the GM runs everything"--that the players do not, cannot control the story even through the mediation of a GM dedicated to fairness, impartiality, and goodwill--I disagree with that sentiment.<br/><br/>You understand what Fred's diagram says, yes? Doesn't "Task Resolution" cover the first two columns (which are really a continuum), and ignore the vertical dimension?<br/><br/>Let's look at a game where major portions of the game operate in just those first two columns, meaning that whatever the player's statement of intent, there's no prior formal agreement regarding the mechanical "stuff" that has to happen to achieve that intent, or even that the intent is achievable at all. I'm saying that there are approaches to GMing such a game which don't lead to "the GM runs everything" or (to paraphrase other formulations) "the GM tells the story while the players just fill in the details".                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Hm, good point about the timeline, buzz.  What I was trying to get at was this: The player's intent certainly does matter before the results are factored into play, no matter whether they're expressed before or after the die roll (and as I note, they don't have any impact on the die roll itself, so we're definitely not in the far right hand column.)  The quote you give, "Let's see if what you're asking falls under the definition of Helpful" is part of that process, and I see it as part of the resolution of the Diplomacy system.  (Otherwise it's just rolling a die for no reason at all and it can have no impact on play.)</blockquote>
Yes, I think this is how things should go in an ideal situation, i.e., the middle column in Fred's diagram.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's not a lot of guidance in the D&amp;D rules on getting to this kind of functional play. Neither the PHB nor the DMG really address player intent at all. The most specific the DMG gets is rewarding a player with a+2 circumstance bonus if they're specific in their task description, e.g., I want to make a Spot to see if I catch that kobold who I just saw run into that room." It's not until DMG2 that there is any talk of saying "Yes" to your players (phrased as "Not saying no") and "reading the mood of the table". (DMG2, even while trying to give helpful advice, is still very cryptic. What I believe is Robin Laws' advice never actually addresses asking players directly what they want; it's always about "sensing," "reading body language," and "keeping up the energy in the room.")<br/><br/>So, we know how it <em>ought</em> to be, but how can we expect DMs to know this too?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Well, obviously it's possible for D&amp;D to have been more specific about what "helpful" means.

I dunno. I think that if Diplomacy could be handled a bit more like Bluff, you could define the skill as rolling to achieve a specific request, and it wouldn't require a huge swath of rules. <em>Iron Heroes'</em> take on the social skills actually makes a great deal of headway in this regard. (I cannot recommend IH enough.)                        </div>

                            Eliot, you realize I maintain that "Task Resolution" as the Forge has defined it means that, indeed, the GM runs everything.<br/><br/>It seems to me you're saying "Well, yeah, most of the time but sometimes it's players too."<br/><br/>Which breaks my beloved definition. And, unsurprisingly, I just shrug and say "Well, THOSE times it's conflict resolution." No one said it was gonna be seemless. In fact, it's usually not. When that stuff happens, it's conflict. No biggie from my perspective.<br/><br/>Indeed, this thread began with, among other things, my observation that "Hey, guys, people get those two things confused all the time, and more often than not they are pointing at conflict resolution and saying 'task resolution.' But, it's conflict resolution as I understand the definition posed by Baker."                        </div>

                            Buzz - Hang on now, nobody is claiming D20 social stuff is in the right hand column where player intent actually changes the mechanics of the situation where bonuses and penalties and so on would be appropriate. I agree, the +/-2 circumstance bonus is really not indicative of much of anything. My contention is just that in order to adjudicate the Diplomacy skill as written, the GM has to come to some evaluation of player intent and the player has to state their intent, the more clearly the better. Otherwise, how does the GM know whether the NPC falls in a place on the disposition scale where they'll do what the player intends they do?<br/>
<br/>
Edit: as far as "structure" goes, I'm looking at p.6 of the 3.0 D&amp;D PHB and it says "you create a unique fictional character that lives in your imaginations and the imaginations of your friends.  One person in the game, the Dungeon Master, controls the monsters and people that live in the fantasy world. You and your friends face the dangers and explore the mysteries that your Dungeon Master sets before you." It then lists a bunch of cool things PCs can end up doing in D&amp;D. Seems pretty obvious to me what kind of structure the game will have. You create your character, you use it to deal with the challenges presented by the DM. Diplomacy is one tool in your bag.                        </div>

Well, the die roll tells them where on the disposition scale the NPC falls. Granted, the DM needs to know some basic stuff, like whether the PC is telling the truth or not (in which case you're talking Bluff vs. Sense Motive first). The weird thing is that there are no modifiers for whether the PC is making a reasonable request or not. Like I said before, intent comes afterwards. You change their attitude <em>first</em> and see if your request falls within the parameters of the new attitude.<br/><br/>(In BWr terms, D&amp;D Diplomacy is more like Soothing Platitudes and Etiquette. You roll them first to get the NPC to think you're a fine, upstanding young lad, and then bypass DoW entirely and go straight into negotiations with the DM. "Okay, he likes me. What are you going to let me get out of him?")<br/><br/>So yeah, at some point, the player has to let the DM know what it is they're trying to get from the NPC.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that it might be more helpful if Diplomacy was rolled <em>after the intent</em>, so we know whether the player gets what they want. There's still room for lots of DM input (e.g., modifiers for, say, the reasonableness of the request, the relative social stations of the parties involved, etc.), and there'd be no need for haggling after the roll.<br/><br/>I dunno. If a to-hit roll can tell me that my sword did X damage to the orc, why can't my Diplomacy roll tell me that I convinced the duke to lend me twenty horsemen?<br/><br/>Man, we're definitely many a league from the original purpose of the thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<blockquote>Seems pretty obvious to me what kind of structure the game will have. </blockquote>
So, one has to ask oneself: Is it self-evident? Or, is it a matter of "I've been gaming for 10-odd years. Of course this seems pretty obvious. This is 'how it's done.' " <br/><br/>And, to take it another step, is it obvious because you've played RPGs <i>one particular way</i> and not really bothered to investigate whether someone else may have played RPGs anything but that one particular way?<br/><br/>I am trying, however poorly, to argue that this is the case: That we read the overwhelming majority of most RPG texts seeing things <i>that are not physically there in the text</i> because we "just know" what gaming is, presume others also "just know" and don't often acknowledge that the thing we all "just know" isn't in fact the same thing, exactly.<br/><br/>Now, clearly, everyone who's played the game has figured it out. But I do not believe, based on my obsverations and interactions with people, that "playing D&amp;D" is the same thing even in the same group or same city, let alone the same Internet forum.                        </div>

On a more intently personal level: I honestly am not that interested in whether I play a game right as compared to whether I play it well. If a designer somewhere approves or disapproves of my play is not even on my priority list.                        </div>

                            Thank goodness you've got that straightened out. Fred's chart can only refer to play, actually. Yes, a particular system might tend to suggest one corner or another, but, in practice, in most games, it's possible to play such that you're in an entirely differnet quadrant (sextant?). Indie games often have as much ambiguity here as D&amp;D texts do - sometimes intentionally, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
Matt's example is good as an example of play being in the task quadrant. JD, Fred tried above to clarify what he means there, and I'm not sure if you're seeing his distinction or not. In the case in question, it's very easy to read "helpful" in two very distinct ways:<br/>
<br/>
1. The NPC now has an in-game motive to help the PC who converted him. But that doesn't change what the NPC knows, and, in fact, he might be said by the GM not to have anything helpful that he can do for the characters.<br/>
<br/>
2. The NPC now has an in-game motive, and the GM decides that he must also have the knowledge sought, else he can't be helpful in this situation. So he decides on the spot that the NPC does know the information in question. Even if previously he had decided that the NPC did not know (but hadn't established it).<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to get at the end of the spectra here. As you point out the intent is relevant in both cases, because in case one, it's being ignored. But Fred is saying that what differentiates each case is, in fact, how the GM deals with the intent. In the first case, the GM is ignoring the intent. In the second case, the GM is using the player intent to alter the world so that the outcome is what the player wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Fred's delineation is specifically whether or not intent is being taken into account and affecting the GM's resolution outcome narration.<br/>
<br/>
It's my fault for bringing specific names of systems into this, but what I'm trying to say is that the designs in question support X or Y in actual play. I think what Matt is saying is that D&amp;D is, at best, ambiguous, in terms of what it supports. Leaving a GM to play any way from far left, to far right. But in stating things in terms of tasks, I think it leans a bit to the left.<br/>
<br/>
This was certainly D&amp;D's intent in it's original designs - nobody imagined that one should take player intent into consideration. In fact, when this was done, it was considered bad play - cheating. Try to wrap your head around this, but, back when I started playing D&amp;D, if a player had said, "My character goes up to a guy, and asks him about the sewers. Remember my Charisma bonus on the reaction roll" it's not too hard to determine the player's intent. He wants to have his character find the sewers. But if I as GM arbitrarily decided that the character in question knew where the sewers were - if I didn't roll a die at least to see if he randomly knew - then I would have been accused of cheating. If I'd decided that the character did not know, I'd have been accused of cheating to defeat the players. If I'd decided that the character did know, I'd have been accused of cheating by helping the players.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, sure it's easy to pretend like you have it pre-determined whether or not the NPC in question knows. So you might not get caught. In fact, if you're helping the PCs, the players might just turn a blind eye to such cheating, and assume that you're working from a pre-set notion of what exists.<br/>
<br/>
They were wargame scenarios. Would you expect that in Panzerblitz (Gygax and gang's favorite game prior to D&amp;D) that if you shoot at a decoy marker that the other player just gets to decide whether or not the decoy actually had a unit under it or not? No, the decision had to be based on some notion of a hard reality that made the game "fair." Any fiat by anyone on either side helping out was cheating. And I'm talking RPGs here.<br/>
<br/>
This is the way that, oh, at a guess, 90% of all RPG play was up until the mid 1980s, the first ten years of it's existence. It was normal, expected, and everybody enjoyed themselves doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, most RPG texts, whether or not the authors intended play to be like this, were written with the same language that implies through it not mentioning player intent, that it's to be ignored. As Matt puts it, yeah, most RPG players have come to an understanding that most RPGs are not wargames any more. And so they've adopted ways of playing that the rules don't state that they should specifically in the mechanics. Oh, there might be some "Advice" section that might imply these things. But the mechanics themselves rarely say anything that would make one think that intent should be taken into account. It's tradition of play that causes this to happen.<br/>
<br/>
As an empirical test, you could put the text in front of people who've never played RPGs before, and see what hey do. In most cases, I think that they'll end up with something that is far left on the chart. But you could easily counter that most players play by tradition, and you'd be right (who learns by reading a RPG manual?)<br/>
<br/>
So, again, talking about what the text supports or allows isn't saying that all play of game X will be in column Y. What you can say, however, is that in these designs, the players don't have any recourse if and when the DM does decide to control play by moving left in the columns. The GM can say, "Look, where does it say that if you're asking somebody for help that the person you ask will be able to help?"<br/>
<br/>
Now, if the GM has done this before, paying attention to intent, then the player may rightly be confused. I think this is a common problem, and basically a CA incoherence problem (though we don't have to get into that too deeply). It's also very common in Illusionist play where, as long as the players are on the right path the GM has set, he'll pay attention to intent, and when they're not, he'll ignore it. But in all cases pretending like he's ignoring it. This is the illusion, that player intent has nothing to do with the outcomes, but that it's all happening mechanistically and deterministically in a pre-set world. That player choice matters, because it's just as if they were actors in a real other world.<br/>
<br/>
This works as long as the players, who understand that it's going on, decide to suspend their disbelief that the GM isn't creating this illusion. It becomes problematic as soon as any player decides to try to take actual control of his character's destiny. Which, given that the illusion informs the player that he does have control, is a common occurance.<br/>
<br/>
Matt is ever so slightly off in saying that task play means GM control. It does allow it, if the GM wants to take it. But that ignores "open" play, where the GM has no plan of action, and the task declarations become their own path of play (which, if the players don't have specific plot intents behind their task actions, leads to "meandering" play with no plot). This is often proposed as the other solution to the problem of GM control, for him to abdicate it entirely for an completely mechanistic approach to play. In which case player intents come to light as producing plot, but only with iterative attempts. "What, he doesn't know about the sewers? Ok, I use my Gather Info, to find somebody who does know about them, and *then* I use my Diplomacy on *that* guy."<br/>
<br/>
This form of play quickly can become problematic, however, because with the traditional player/GM power split, the players may well not know enough about the world to be proactive. In which case, again, play meanders and is rarely found to be interesting (I suppose there's some group somewhere that doesn't care about plot or exciting things happening, and are looking purely for escape).<br/>
<br/>
Am I helping or just being more confusing?<br/>

<blockquote>Matt is ever so slightly off in saying that task play means GM control.</blockquote>
Maybe so, Mike. My rationale is pretty simple. Let's say the players allow for "open" play. Well, who's the arbiter of what happens? Seems to me no one but the GM has final authority. If anything happens, it's because he allows it to. I don't recognize any group dynamic like that where it's not the players turning to the GM for a nod, or at least aware he can bring down the hammer any time, with their assent. GM has total control = GM has authority. <br><br>So, he's not some Stalinist regime. He's "The GM" with all the traditional weight we recognize as "the god power" and all that stuff. The benevolent dictator, yadda yadda. Certainly there are there other group dynamics, and maybe even ones I'm ignoring or overlooking. But, that's my take on it.<br><br>Otherwise (or, maybe NOT otherwise, others will have to be the judge of my issue in this post) spot on! NOT more confusing.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Mike, I think in both 1 and 2, player intent definitely enters play by the evaluation not of what the NPC knows, but of what the player is asking of the NPC. In other words, if the player's intent is "get this guy to give us the key to the dungeon" he has to say to the GM at some point "I ask him for the key to the dungeon" and the GM has to decide where on the NPC disposition table that form of assistance falls. If the player hides his intent and doesn't ask for the key to the dungeon, the system does not enter play, and if the GM does not decide where on the disposition table the player's intent falls, then it doesn't enter play. I am a hundred percent talking about D&amp;D play! We can argue all day about how brilliant or dumb or neither the GM is for making the guy have the key to the dungeon or not have it, but in practice, the social system does not ever enter play, period, unless player intent is both expressed and evaluated. That's what I'm getting at.<br>
<br>
Edit: The other examples I give are similarly talking about play. The Vampire hunting mechanic requires the player to tell the GM whether they're being seductive or brutal in their hunt, and it affects the mechanics used and the potential payoffs.                        </br></br></div>

I hate to keep coming back to this, JD, but this isn't how it's done by-the-book. The DM doesn't have to decide anything, really. I can certainly see a DM running Diplomacy that way: "That request would probably require a Helpful result, so you need to hit DC 30." However, even if the DM doesn't know what the player is asking for, it doesn't change the fact that hitting that 30 means shifting Indifferent to Helpful, period.<br><br>I mean, I could totally see an exchange like this:<br><br>Player: "I want to butter up the duke so he thinks well of me."<br>DM: "Okay, roll Diplomacy."<br>Player: (rolls) "I got a 32."<br>DM: "Okay, that gets him to Helpful."<br>Player: "Cool! Now I'm going to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage."<br><br>And this is even an example of a DM being pretty forthcoming. He isn't required to tell the player what the NPC's starting attitude was, nor what the resulting shift is. Barring a Sense Motive check beforehand, it's entirely possible that the DM has decided the duke is Hostile, but keeping up appearances. That phat 32 the player rolled gets him Indifferent, but the DM (again barring Sense Motive) could have the duke react as if he now loves the PC... all the better to stab him in the back later.<br><br>I dunno. Is this DM being a jerk? Maybe, maybe not. Does the text say he can't do this? Not really. All it says is, "Be fair." And, depending on the group, maybe this is fair, or, at least, it fits in with maintaining the illusion, if that's what the group is after. I mean, I'd be asking players for Sense Motive checks left and right (which is closest to the RAW, IMO), but I can see some groups not wanting this, as it may mess with immersion. Of course, some groups might just have the DM make all of these rolls in secret... which then brings up trust. Is the group trusting the DM to keep those secret rolls fair, or trusting him to nudge them in directions that are "good for the story"?<br><br>This thread has made me think more about immersion than I have in a long time. My groups play HERO and D&amp;D, respectively, and I've been banging my head against them as I've delved more and more into indie RPGs ("<em>Burning Wheel</em> would fit this campaign so much better! Curse you!"). However, I realize that the people in my groups seem to prefer the "center to left column" play that speaks more to these trad games than the "right column" play of many indie systems. And Fred's diagram has me thinking that I should be able to run D&amp;D and HERO in more of a "Forge-fu" style that still gives my players the basic style of play they want.<br><br>Hmm. Not sure why I brought that up. Making explicit the lens through which I'm reading all this, I guess. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>[Edit: Never mind. I don't need to be in this discussion.]</p>
<p>[ReEdit: Crap. OK, here it is.]</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>If you believe that means "the GM runs everything"--that the players do not, cannot control the story even through the mediation of a GM dedicated to fairness, impartiality, and goodwill--I disagree with that sentiment.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The GM is forbidden from one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being impartial</li>
<li>Generating opposition</li>
</ul>
<p>Coincidentally, the job of the GM in a game like D&amp;D or GURPS is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be impartial</li>
<li>Generate opposition</li>
</ul>
<p>That's like having one team referee.</p>
<p>One way a GM provides opposition while appearing to remain impartial is by reducing the impact the players have on the fiction while making sure the characters succeed. The single best way to reduce player input is by having the players do things that don't impact the fiction.</p>
<p>GM: There's a sewage tunnel that will let you into the castle.<br>
Player: Is there a door?<br>
GM:... Uh, yeah, there's a door, but, uh, there are two guards there. If they see you, they'll alert the rest of the Royal Guard.<br>
Player: I'll distract the guards.<br>
GM: That requires an 18 or better on a d20!<br>
Player: OK, here are some modifiers. I roll and succeed!<br>
GM: Uh, the door's locked.<br>
Player: I pick the lock.<br>
GM: It's locked, uh, <em>magically</em>. It would be easier to go through the sewer.<br>
Player: I have a magic lockpick. I roll and succeed!<br>
GM: Um, inside, you realize that the hallway doesn't go the way you wanted to go inside. It looks like it only goes to a room full of guards. You're pretty sure the sewer goes that way, though.<br>
Player: The guards were guarding a room full of guards?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>First things first: I acknowledge that GM is being a dick here. I don't know why Player is even playing with him. Nonetheless, this is <em>totally kosher</em> in D&amp;D or a bazillion other games. I know because I've played those games and been that dick. I can also smell the dick when I'm a player in a game and this is what's going on, and it's happened frequently with lots of GMs, typically when I've tried to do any creative problem solving. It's led to some real social crises about whether I should walk out or not.</p>
<p>The above can be satisfied with a system where what the player says is, "I want the character to get into the castle." and the player and GM <em>play a game</em> to find out if the character gets in. They don't <em>banter</em> to see if he gets in. They play a game. They move pieces, roll dice, spend coins, whatever, according to fair rules. Naturally, this can go the other way: the GM says "I want the character beaten up and imprisoned." and they play a game to find out if this happens.</p>
<p>"Don't be a dick" is not enough. The rules have to say that the GM gets to referee <em>OR</em> provide opposition, and if the GM is providing opposition, they have to have the tools to do it totally and passionately.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Jason, whether or not a game designer approves of your play doesn't even matter to the game designer. What matters to the designer is that they give you a procedure of play that will give you an enjoyable experience. They do that by making rules that work. If they don't make rules that work or they leave out important ones, you'll use other rules, and are therefore not playing their game, even if you've got their book on the table and roll the sizes of dice they use. But if you're doing that and having fun instead of not having fun with the rules as written, that means that the original game was poorly designed, or at the very least was designed for a different kind of play. The only time this is a conflict, and this happens a lot, is when someone claims that a game is broken but hasn't been following the rules. This happens all the time with Dogs in the Vineyard. Someone will skip Town Creation and then claim the game's broken. The rest of the time, it's the rules leaving out an important part. Like saying what the effects of a die roll are.</p>

<p>Dammit. I can never retract fast enough. Most of the posts I write end up being about a quarter of the words I wrote. Some end up being zero quarters.</p>
<p>It's an indictment of trad RPGS <em>as written</em>. I think lots of people have invented perfectly good and even excellent games with their groups and been <em>under the impression</em> that the important thing was that they were playing D&amp;D or GURPS or Vampire or whatever. But the frequency of "it all depends on the GM" leads me to believe that the written rules themselves have been of secondary importance to the systems devised by the groups, whether consciously or unconsciously, to get what they want.</p>
<p>I don't think that's any longer a tenable position. Game designers, it turns out, can write down the procedures that they've used to have fun, and a lot of people can follow those procedures and have similar fun. One of the things that has be written down in many ways is, "What happens when the dice are rolled?" Codifying that is a really good idea, because "What happens?"* is why we play the game.</p>

<div class="Message">
                            We keep going around, Jason. Your example is obfuscatory of the line, because it's addressing a different issue. Let me try one more example:<br/>
<br/>
Player: I want to try to get the key from that dude. I'll use Diplomacy.<br/>
GM: Well, OK, you can use Diplomacy to make him ammenable, but only I know whether or not he has the key.<br/>
<br/>
You see what's happening here? This is an overt example of the DM using "intent irrellevant" methodology. He's saying that the resolution system can't determine if the target character has the key. Which is what the player's intent is - to tag the target character as having the key.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why people keep bringing up bad GMing or Assholism. This is neither. In many styles of play, this is exactly the correct thing for the GM to do. He's telling the player, who is trying to have his intent to have an effect on the resolution, that the player is not allowed to do this. All the player is allowed to do is select from a list of possible actions for that character, and then we roll to see if he's successful at that action.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The key example is a bad one, in that it's not established whether or not the player knows that the target character has the key. Let's examine each case. If the player knows that the target character has the key, then this is simply a task to get the target character to be friendly enough to give it to him. The GM using column one resolution might (might, I emphasize) in that circumstance decide that a success means that the player gets his intent as a subsequent follow up consequence of the resolution, but not as part of the resolution itself. That is, if the GM says that the guy gives him the key, he's using the same sort of discretion that he has to direct any NPC action. He doesn't see it as part of the resolution, but just what a friendly NPC would do.<br/>
<br/>
He might also decide that the player does not get his intent.<br/>
<br/>
He can still legitimately prevent the character from getting the key by several means. He can say that, though the PC was successful in his die roll in making the NPC friendly, that the NPC is also friendly (or better) with another NPC to whom he promised not to give the key away. All the PC has done is to make the character friendly to him in this case, he hasn't convinced him to give him the key, and in this circumstance, it's plausible not to allow the key to go. This is clearly column one play.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this isn't bad GMing, or being an asshole, it's a particular style of play that some people enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Now, second case, the player doesn't know that the NPC has the key. In fact the GM doesn't know if the NPC has the key. It's plausible that he might, but it's not been previously established in any way where the key is. If the player asks to get the key, then we're clearly in the case I made above, where the plaeyer is asking for his intent to affect things per column three. If the GM lets this happen, even though it's not previously established where the key is, and it's plausible for the NPC in question to have it, if he allows success on the roll to mean that the character does have the key because of the success, then he's clearly allowing player intent to inform the resolution. This is column three.<br/>
<br/>
What's hazier is column two. In this case for the example, we have the GM in this case looking at the rule for Diplomacy and saying, "Know what? Nowhere does it say that I can't make him getting the key an outcome of the die roll. So I'll make it hinge on that." The GM looks at player intent, and allows it to have an effect in terms of shaping up the conflict. Other RPGs would allow this explicitly (state intent, figure out which ability to use, etc).<br/>
<br/>
So there are, in fact, three different phenomena here relating to three different sorts of play. If you narrowly construe the D&amp;D rules, they don't allow for any but column one play. It's only with play by experienced RPG players that the resolution cycle is such that it includes intent rather than just "action/reaction" of declared character action.<br/>
<br/>
[Edited to note that I'm working on the rules as quoted above. The D&amp;D rules could, in fact, have advice or something I've not seen that could make a narrow construal of the rules such that one can include more than just the outcome mechanical effect indicated.]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joshua, I think that many RPGs aren't written well, but that this isn't particularly endemic to traditional games. To say so is to say that including intent is always superior. But the problem with that is that you're largely saying that whole styles, like the Finnish LARP scene, are inferior. Because you're not seeing what potential value is brought by leaning to the left on the chart - you're just seeing the potential problems. Especially problems in getting to your prefered style of play.<br/>
<br/>
This is, in a way, Beeg Horseshoe yet again. And I'll go to my grave believing that, even if it is problematic, that people who say they have more fun playing that way are not lying. Because I understand the quality that's lost by going right on the chart.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Matt, you're making a find ideological point. Is there a difference between abdication of power, and an acutal lack of it? I dunno. In actual play I don't think it matters. Moreover, I think that one can have a player-GM power split that says that, in fact, the GM is not the final arbiter in play of this sort. In proto-Universalis games it's often consensus by vote, for instance. So I think you can have player propelled "intent irellevant" play.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's rare to non-existent, sure. But if you call it one-to-one linkage, you make the definition political, and deny any exploration into that area of game design, for instance. It's only a good definition if you want to rant against "intent-irrellevant" play.<br/>

                            I think we are still in severe agreement, Mike. All I am saying is that the only way that the D20 social system can enter play is if intent is stated by the player and evaluated by the GM. What you're saying is that the GM can prevent the social system from entering play, he can make it so the social system doesn't ever even get turned on.  Okay, so how does that affect what I'm saying about the requirement of intent in the system? I can say that DitV doesn't require intent to be evaluated in the Initiation sequence if the GM (or whoever) decides to skip Initiations. Your bigger issue with trad play is a red herring here. If you want to talk about how horrible (or random or diverse?) trad play is, feel free, I won't chime in saying it's not.  I'm just saying the task -&gt; scene axis and opaque -&gt; mechanically important axis are cool tools.<br>
<br>
buzz, I don't see how your example shows intent-less play. It seems like that's a setup, not an execution.  The player's intent (ask for hand in marriage) has not yet been evaluated by the system and GM and entered play.  The answer could be "meh, no, his disposition isn't that good" or "hm, he takes you seriously due to your rockin' diplomacy skills", but both answers require the GM to evaluate the player's intent with respect to the potential outcomes the system recommends.  The system has been primed (by the die roll), but not used. (Edit: Or do you mean the player's real intent all along was to ask for the hand in marriage and because he didn't say it until after the roll that the system was ignoring intent?)<br>
<br>
If the whole point of this go-round is to pretend all of trad play is as close to the opaque end of the grid as possible, and that the opaque end of the grid is inherently bad (damaging???) just count me out of the whole shebang and ignore the rest of what I'm about to post because it's going to Blow. Your. Mind.<br>
<br>
Toon. A trad game (how could a game that came from Steve Jackson in 1984 be anything but?) that actively rewards keeping your intent from the GM and other players as long as possible. Why? Because comedy, particularly the zany style of cartoon comedy pushed in Toon, relies on the unexpected and on surprises. You get mechanical rewards for making the GM and other players laugh when you say and do something unexpected - something they had no clue you intended to do.  And it also rewards you for keeping your characters' actions as "small" as possible - close to the top of the grid.  If you just say "well, in this scene I intend to flummox the cat who is chasing me with a series of traps and tomfoolery", that's what we call in the business BOR RING.  But if every time you open your mouth you're describing a new bizarre method nobody has ever heard of, thought of, or anticipated of flummoxing the dastardly cat, everyone will be rolling and you'll be getting bonus after bonus.  Indeed, the more you're able to surprise people with escalations, puns, reversals and so on, the better the play experience (and the resulting story) will be. So Toon does its best to push play as high and to the left as possible.  "Act Before You Think" is a capitalized piece of player and GM advice. They don't even want YOU to worry too much about what your intent is!<br>
<br>
Just wait until we get to Paranoia, where you're encouraged to deceive the GM about your intent! We'll be on the negative side of these axes yet!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Not necessarily. The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast seems to assume on some kind of thing called "The Story" which the GM runs, thus controlling the player characters. Nothing implies that a scenario should have A Story written into it; a scenario could as well be a description of events and causalities up to the point where the characters become active in the diegesis, and then GM reacting, based on the scenario, on what they do.<br><br>Not that Scenarios could not be about a pre-set story through which the characters a guided.

Basically. The mechanic did exactly what it says it's supposed to, and at no point did the DM need to know anything about what the player's ultimate goal was. Heck, the player could still be concealing their ultimate goal, and the marriage proposal is part of something else. The whole scene could play out without the DM ever being aware of this.<br><br>Granted, I'm kinda reaching here. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>

My only point is that I think your assumption of evaluating intent has more to do with what you recognize as good play than it does anything systemic. Systems like D&amp;D and HERO simply do not care about your intent; not beyond the micro-level, anyway (e.g., "I want to shoot him in the knee"). <br><br>I think Mike has summed this all up pretty well above.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Am I talking about TITBB? Who knows? To interpret that requires a massive flamewar about the meaning of story, the textual analysis of RPG rules...<br><br>Basically, buzz, if I can indulge myself in a little bit of definition, when I say "scenario design" I mean the creation of the situation, not a script of how the situation will play out when the player-characters encounter it. If I've determined that the key to the crypt is the sole possession of Grotius Throckmort III, that says nothing about what the players must do to get into the crypt. They can use explosives. They can try talking to Mr. Throckmort. They can kill him. They can steal the key. Most of the time I like to fall back on mechanical tools to resolve these options. Someone might like to define the process I'd use as "conflict resolution" because it would, in fact, give an answer to the question of "do they get into the crypt" (instead of me just saying "you get into the crypt"), but it turns out that's a bit of a red herring. Joshua is saying that the method of dispassionately evaluating the PCs' likelihood of success isn't available, because I made up the situation.                        </br></br></div>

Absolutely. Trust is a fundamental part of roleplaying contract (aka. social contract). A lot of Story Games replace a certain amount of that trust by turning it into a trust to transparent mechanics. There's still certain amount of trust outside the mechanics ("I trust that no one cheats with the dices", for example), but it's less emphasized, since the mechanics act as a safety net.<br><br>In traditional/freeform/whatever games with no explicit procedures, there's not much else to build upon to than trust that players and GM are doing the same thing and following the ideals set for the event. If the trust erodes or the ideals are not stated and understood, the possibility of a clusterf*ck increases.                        </br></br></div>

GMing guidelines take up the slack but are subject to being ignored and misinterpreted.<br><br>(BTW, what you say about D&amp;D is a recent phenomenon.

IMO, BE works pretty well,though I've only run it once. The GM is essentially just running his batch of NPCs against the PCs; with very few exceptions, he has the same resource limitations they do, i.e., has to jump through the same sort of hoops. I recommend it highly.                        </div>

                            Jason, first, once again you bring up some problem I have with traditional play or something, which is very odd, since I'm the one championing it here. I mean, really, I'm having trouble seeing what you're reading. Are you attributing something somebody else said to me?<br/>
<br/>
Second, I'm saying specifically that nowhere does the D20 rules, or a common form of play that comes from reading those rules, require intent. I'm not saying that the GM prevents intent from mattering, I'm saying that he's doing what the rules are telling him to do in this case with an interpretation that's quite natural. Even common. The "exception" here is if and when the GM decides to allow intent.<br/>
<br/>
I guess you could say that this is a matter of POV. But, as I say, the text doesn't really matter in terms of categorizing the play. What matters is that you and I agree that both ways to play exist, and that they're both functional. Your point about intent and D20 rules seems to read something analogous to, "If I have a government that takes away my rights, and a constitution that doesn't say that they can't do so, that if they take away my rights, that the government in question is all about the rights." Does that help you see what seems so confusing?<br/>
<br/>
I keep giving arguments showing examples of how D20 rules do not support intent, and your response keeps seeming to be, "See, we agree! They do support intent!" What have I missed here?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shreyas, the feature of play to which I'm referring is sometimes called immersion. Any argument that says, "Well I don't need that to get immersion" ignores that this preference we're speaking of isn't yours, but that of people like Jukka who claim (I believe honestly and accurately), that they require this sort of play to get the thing that they call Immersion.<br/>

Not to tie it entirely to the immersion, another example could be a military game. You want to resolve things bullet by bullet or grenade to grenade. Task resolution fits it's nicely; you're in a confusing situation with limited line of sight, and you want to survive, and resolve the situation based on simulation, character stats, rules (shell shock, concussion damage, what have you) and players knowledge of tactics. There's a reason that Phoenix Combat or Twilight 2000 exist.                        </div>

                            Yep, good point, immersion is but one thing that it facilitates. Not just in being Fred's "task" scale, but in that intention in a competition is highly problematic at this level. Basically the GM's discretion in what intents to allow becomes a balance problem.<br/>

                            Okay, then we'll (Mike, buzz) will just have to agree to disagree, because I don't see any way that the D20 social skill system can be used at all, ever, to provide any input on play, without player intent being both expressed and considered. The counter-examples given so far fall into only a few categories: <br>
<br>
* breaking the rules ("I know it says 'helpful' but I'll make the NPC unhelpful anyway!"), <br>
* not using the rules (buzz' example about the player not expressing his intent until after the die roll truncates play before the GM makes the evaluation and anything changes in play), <br>
* or something totally outside the rules (how it is decided to what degree an NPC can help once they are willing, how to handle situations not covered by the rules like convincing armies, voters, legislators, etc.)  <br>
<br>
It's like the game text is  gone, forgotten, poof!  It's like no play could ever possibly take place in the way the rules describe it or if it does, it's just some niggling little detail, something gained from "good GMing" rather than a designer explicitly writing a chart that classifies player intents into (certainly non-exhaustive) categories and a GM of decidedly modest capabilities (me) looking at that chart and doing what it says to do.<br>
<br>
Maybe nobody other than me is playing D20 using the social system as written at all. Maybe every other GM puts their fingers in their ears and screams "LA LA LA" whenever a player says "I'd like to try to use Diplomacy to..."   After all, intent is irrelevant and paying attention to it is an aberration, so why shouldn't they?  If that's true, then just pretend that what I'm describing is "how JDCorley uses the D20 social skills system" and let's move on down the road towards solipsism. It's a nice place to vacation anyway.<br>
<br>
I notice nobody's really saying much about the other examples? D20 combat? Vampire? Come on, it's the most brain-damaging game in the world AND only swine play it! Picking on D&amp;D is so very 2001...anyone want to give the big green book a good kick in the groin?<br>
<br>
And I just said Toon, the funniest game ever written other than Ghostbusters, is pushing everyone towards the vertex of the grid where everyone thinks going to an extreme is problematic!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

My argument is that is that it's not written the way you say it is. But, like you said, we'll have to agree to disagree at this point, lest this thread spiral downward. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

As far as I am concerned, where this is true, there is no need for resolution of any kind other than perhaps a simple statistical model. Resolution happens when a choice needs to be made by a person.                        </div>

                            OK, in looking at Elliot's post, and Jason's in conjunction, I think I've found where the disconnect occurs.<br/>
<br/>
If a player is choosing an action for his character, and that action does not allow for additional intent, then it's intent-irrellevant. That is, Elliot, if we're playing a wargame RPG, and, as you say, "action = intent", then this is "intent-irrellevant." Because "intent relevant" doesn't mean "Player chose this action." It means that "player chose this action, and we're looking at some tailoring of the potential result to match some further intent on the player's part than can be discerned by the selection of the tasky action alone."<br/>
<br/>
If we're not talking about that, then Jason is right, and we're not talking about anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
But, from the beginning of this thread, it's been clear that the "problem" is that often GMs look only at the action selected, and do not attempt to discern further intent other than would be implied by the action selected (or their own guesses). The cited example is Vincent's "Safe" example. Where the player says that he's opening the safe - the "task" (or, according to Fred, the intent-irrelevant part of the declaration) - when really the player's intent is to find the documents inside, and the "task" selected is only the means by which to get there.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, using intent-irrelevant thinking, the success will not determine whether or not the things are in the safe - or even if the character finds something in the safe. That is, even if the GM has pre-decided that the papers are in the safe, he could say, "OK, you've got it open, but there are lots of papers in here - make a search roll." Or, worse, he might say, "OK, you open the safe, and find the money there." To which the player responds, "No, no, I was looking for the papers."<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, however, you'll get "OK, safe's open, now what?" Which merely requires that the player make another statement of intent, to see if the papers are inside, and then to pick them up if they are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See the difference between methods? If you're saying, Jason, that selection of task indicates intent, that's inarguably true, but not at all the subject under discussion here. Which is the difference between player intent being determined solely from their selection of a pre-set type of action, or if more is being discerned about their intent, so more can be resolved with the roll than simply a mechanical yes/no answer that only relates to the selected task.<br/>
<br/>
Any better?<br/>

<br>
Um...doesn't that apply only to the third column of games? It's my contention that the D20 social system is in the second column, not the third. <br>
<br>
(And the "Tasky"ness is a whole different axis, right? We can ignore intent just as much in scene-sized chunks as we can in smaller chunks.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I believe it's the second column. In the third column, you're not tailoring the result, you're literally resolving the result. E.g., the die roll determines if the documents are in the safe, period.                        </div>

                            Jason, the example is both down and right. Fred's point is that the term "task" should apply to the amount axis, and not to what Vincent is trying to demonstrate in the example. Which is intent.<br/>
<br/>
So let's ignore for a moment that it's farther down, and look at the column. Everyone agrees that the example involves intent, just whether or not it's second or third column. We really can't know from the example given if it's second or third column. But, if we suppose for an instant, that the GM decides to put the papers in the safe, as a result of the resolution being successful, then we're clearly in column 3. Note carefully that I'm not saying that column three is defined by establishing facts unrelated to the resolution. But if the GM is doing that, it's clearly column three.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let's say that the GM knows that the papers are not there. So the player opens the safe, and the GM says, "You don't find the papers." This is column 2. Column one here would be, "OK, you've opened the safe, now what?" even if the player stated, "I'm opening the safe so I can obtain the papers.<br/>
<br/>
Now what if the GM has established that the papers are in the safe? Well, if he says, "You open the safe, and find the papers" that's column 2. Note that if he hasn't pre-defined the fact, that this will look precisely like column 3. But often it is transparent the sort of thing that the GM is doing.<br/>
<br/>
So, to recap:<br/>
<br/>
Col 1 - Player states intent, GM ignores the intent and simply resolves stated task (which is why I think that calling it "Task Resolution" wasn't so innacurate).<br/>
Col 2 - Player states intent, GM pays attention to intent, but does not define success as getting intent neccessarily. He could define an interesting failure instead, for instance, perhaps based on whether or not he'd established the papers as being in the safe.<br/>
Col 3 - Player states intent, GM pays attention to the intent to the extent that he makes success mean that the player gets his intent.<br/>
<br/>
Again, these are example outcomes of an example situation. So don't take the techniques used as me trying to say that they're definitive, please.<br/>
<br/>
And, again, yes, lots of people play D20 paying attention to player intent beyond what the mechanics indicate. But many others do not, and those that do, I'd argue, are doing so out of a traditition of employing such techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a good example. In Hero Quest, the rules are actually ambiguous on the subject of whether or not intent matters. It explicitly says that the player should state a goal, but not whether this is actually just a task statement, or a statement of intent on outcome. I have advised lots of people to assume that it means intent on outcome, because this makes the system a lot more functional in my opinion. But this is a case of drifting what the rules say to something playable. It would be an equally far drift to say that intent should be ignored - and, indeed, many people play this way, framing the contests in terms of the tasks selected, instead of looking at the player's intent.<br/>
<br/>
(Again, I'd argue with these folks that problems they complain about stem from this reading, but that's for another debate).<br/>
<br/>
The point is that, if we're to categorize what the text supports we can't look at the exceptions, but what the most common interpretations of the texts are. And, while there's a considerable D20 population that drifts the rules to making intent part of play, I'd argue that most D20 players still don't do this, and that the rules support their interpretation. The rules for diplomacy say, "Change the target's rating" nowhere does it add "So that the target then gives the character what the player intends them to give them." If the GM decides that the NPC does give them the thing - which is logical - then he's doing so not as part of the resolution system, but as part of his general GM discretion as to what NPCs will do given a certain description.<br/>

                            Okay, we are not turned around then. I was right, I just misunderstood what you meant by 'tailoring results'.  Seriously,if looking at a list of designer-provided adjectives and deciding which action fit under which adjective (like deciding "give the key to the dungeon" is under "helpful") is 'tailoring results' then we're setting the bar absurdly low and making that first column almost nonexistent for most games. But hell, why not? In that case it makes me look totally fucking brilliant that I thought to move all those things to the second column despite all the designers apparently trying to stop me.<br>
<br>
I still don't see why we couldn't have a scene-resolution scale in the first column. "I want to find incriminating evidence on the Duke". "I want to sway the army to my cause with bribery and skulduggery." "I want to undertake a months-long smear campaign to prevent the Senator's reelection."  <br>
<br>
"Okay, you succeed, now what?" or "No, you fail, now what?"  <br>
<br>
Hell, I've run scenes like that in superhero games where the character was far more competent than the challenge facing them and I was perfectly okay with the character achieving what the player wanted without any die rolling or consulting any other resolution system other than my own sense of pacing and their character at all.  (Slightly different from the 'autosuccess' idea of a lot of games, but similar.)  At that point I was curious about what the player was up to in the sense of "oh man, I bet this is gonna be good, what's he gonna do now?" but I sure as hell didn't tailor the results in any way.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Okay, I have a question:<br/>
<br/>
(Actually, I have a lot of other questions too -- but I'd like to hear an answer on this one before I spam you with more of my confusion.)<br/>
<br/>
I'd like you to consider the following two situations.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Case <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a></b><br/>
I'm playing traditional D&amp;D and the "sewers" example above comes up.  I'll restate it a little bit for clarity:  Let's say the PCs encounter a night watchman and the Bard decides to ask him where an entrance to the secret sewer system is.  The Bard has a great Diplomacy skill and his player wants to get a roll to "persuade" the guard to lead them to an entrance.  But the DM looks at his prep notes and sees that only the 5 Wise Men know the entrances to the secret sewers and the Nightwatchman is not among them.  What does the DM do?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Case <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a></b><br/>
I'm playing Sorcerer, let's say the "Forbidden Tome" scenario from 'The Sorcerer's Soul'.  One of the players concludes that gangboss Mickey Sharpe had Matt Killian rubbed out.  His PC sweet-talks his way into Sharpe's club, where he confronts the crimelord in front of the great and the good of the city.  The PC has Boost Will, and a bunch of rollover dice from the sneaking in.  The player states his intent to shame Sharpe into confessing to Killian's murder.  But the GM looks at the Relationship Map on p71 of Sorcerer &amp; Sword and sees that, per the scenario prep, <i>Sharpe didn't actually kill Killian</i>.  What does the GM do?<br/>
<br/>
Am I wrong in seeing these two situations as pretty strong analogues?<br/>
Where, and how, do you think they differ?<br/>
What effect do different resolution systems have on GM decisions here?<br/>
Can a GM restrict player Intents and still provide Relevance?  How? (Or, why not?)                        </div>

It's a good question.  As far as I can tell, they're exactly the same.  Addressing this is why I tried to make a spin-off thread, <br><br><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1750&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>Intentions in *ANY* Resolution</b></a> </br></br></div>

I can only speak to this one, as my copy of <em>Sorcerer</em> just arrived a couple days ago.<br><br>By the book? The DM says, "The watchman really wants to help you, but he has no idea about any secret sewers."<br><br>A generous DM leaning towards the center column might add: "He has some ideas for whom you could ask, though."                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Nothing about the check says the watchman has any ideas where to look next. If the DM adds that in on the fly, we start veering into column two.                        </div>

If the watchman has a high enough intelligence to respond to the character's questions, he certainly has a high enough intelligence to make some suggestions as to where he'd go if he wanted to find out those things. (Also, as a watchman, he would no doubt have a few ranks in Knowledge(local) which would allow a check under that rule.)<br/>

Actually, you two are arguing across each other, because you are worried about what represents a "mainstream" playstyle, while Buzz is talking about what kinds of play fall into which regions of Fred's chart.                        </div>

                            Anyone else want to take a crack at my two cases?<br/>
<br/>
I'm interested to know if there is a difference between the way the "Diplomacy" scenario plays out in Task Resolution and Conflict Resolution games (if that's what they are) and to find out if I am right in thinking those situations are analogues.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?                        </div>

                            I think that in both cases your phrasing of your intentions go beyond the bounds of authority the games give you.<br><br>In neither game are you allowed to state intentions beyond what your character can accomplish. In neither D&amp;D or Sorcerer can you say "I persuade (the Night Watchman/Mickey Sharpe) to grow wings and fly," so why should you be able to say "I persuade (the Night Watchman/Mickey Sharpe) to give me information he doesn't have?"<br><br>So I don't think your example compares the relevancy of intent between the two games. Your example compares the reach of player authority. Yes, D&amp;D and Sorceror have similar player authority in that respect, but that doesn't say anything about task vs. conflict resolution.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Robert, <br/><br/>Adam is on the right track. <br/><br/>There is a difference between your examples that, again, has nothing to do with task vs conflict resolution -- the guard really doesn't know the answer and so can't be convinced to give it. The dude that isn't the murderer, however, could be convinced to confess to a crime he didn't commit. The cops get folks to do this all the time. So the question is: are you wanting to change the game to say the dude actually killed the guy, or are you just wanting to force dude to confess? Because in the second case it isn't the same sort of example at all.<br/><br/>Now, if we stay on one example and try it in "task" vs "conflict" we may get a better read on the divide between them. So let us say that we're trying to find a way into the sewers, and the GM knows that only the Five Wise Dudes know the way in. In no-clear-intent or what-the-hell-ever-we're-calling-it-now-used-to-be-task resolution it might go like this: <br/><br/>Player: I use my Gather Information to find a good Bar<br/>GM: Um... okay, roll. <br/>Player: Okay, I get a 17, is that enough? <br/>GM: Sure, you find an awesome bar. There are totally girls there, you could ...<br/>Player: No, I'm not here for that. I find a smart looking guy<br/>GM: Okay... that's easy to do. <br/>Player: Now I want to use Diplomacy to make friends with him. <br/>GM: Okay, that'll take a 20. <br/>Player: I get a 20, and I make friend with him and buy him a drink.<br/>GM: He tells you his name is Darb. <br/>Player: Cool, I ask Darb to show me how to get into the sewers<br/>GM: He doesn't know how to get into the sewers. <br/>Player: What? Shit, I ask him who would.<br/>GM: He says no one does, save the Five Wise Dudes. <br/>Player: Fine, I use my Gather Information to find out where I find the Five Wise Dudes.<br/>GM: Okay, that'll take a 25<br/>Player: Okay, I got a 27<br/>GM: So you finally come to the venerable sanctuary of the five wise dudes, where they wait for you in purple prose description here. <br/>Player: Okay, so I convince them to let me go to the sewers<br/>GM: That'll be a Diplomacy roll<br/>Player: 17<br/>GM: Good enough, they take you. <br/><br/>The big thing here is that because the Player isn't letting the GM know what his end goal is the GM can't help steer him at it until the end -- assuming the GM would want to steer the player. The player never knows which roll will end up with him at the sewers, or near the sewers, or if he can even get to the sewers. So pretty much he keeps trying different things until he finds one that will work. Task by task, no clear intent. <br/><br/>In conflict/clear intent/scene resolution it might go like this: <br/><br/>Player: I want to find a way into the sewers, I'd like to use my Diplomacy to make a local friend who can help me do that.<br/>GM: Roll your Diplomacy<br/>Player: I get a 27<br/>GM: Okay, you meet a guy named Darb who tells you that only the Five Wise Dudes know the way in, but because he likes you so much he takes you to their sanctuary where they wait for you in purple prose description here, because Darb vouches for you they show your way into the sewers. <br/><br/>Here everything happens based on the stated intent, and on success the character goes right through. It would be possible to break this down into sub tasks and still have the overall itnent resolution work above-board, vis a vis Fred's chart. (For example the GM could say, "Okay you need to make a local friend, then you need to convince him to take you to the sages, then you need to convince them to let you into the sewers.") <br/><br/>The big difference is that once the series of rolls is over the player and the GM both know where the player will be or won't be, where as in the series above its a long string of guesses as to what is going on. In our second example the player clearly knows what he needs to do, and failure points are systematized and clear. In the first example the player doesn't know, and the GM may (accidentally or deliberatly) spinning the player farther and farther out because he's not on the same page. <br/><br/>Which isn't to say the first type of resolution is always wrong. Certinaly there are more points of contact where things could go wrong, but as Mike had pointed out a group that is good with this kind of stuff can still have fun and functional times with it. In fact, someone that likes an immersive type stance might have more fun with it as it helps mirror the frustration and difficulty faced by the character in getting to the character goal, or the dawning understanding and deeper interaction with the setting as they move through it more organically (and that deep understanding of the character is the player goal -- getting to the sewers is actually secondary), and so they may not want to skip to the end of the character goal beacuse that would be missing the player's point in playing the scene.<br/><br/>Both of these are in contrast to a game where the player has the authority to change the world (like Donjon) the Player in either case could just say, "I find a hidden hole in the wall and go into the sewers" and move on from there.                        </div>

                            That's pretty much what I'd say, Brand--in practice, that's the divide.<br/><br/>But would it be excessively perverse of me to ask: what if the player in the last example says, right at the beginning, "I don't care if I go through the sewers or what, I want to find whoever's behind this whole murder thing--and murder him. What do I roll?"<br/><br/>If that's acceptible to the notional GM, I'm sure I can come up with a similar example that isn't <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So it seems to me that you're always liable to get into a situation where the GM and the player have to parse a given intent or goal into a series of resolutions, meaning that there's still a need for social negotiation or exertion of authority. And if you can solve that problem, then the "task resolution" example is tractable along the same lines. (Kind of like Steve Martin's piece on how to become a millionaire. "Step One: Get a million dollars.")<br/><br/>The game I've seen which comes closest to overcoming this issue is <i>My Life with Master</i>, but that's basically because the game maintains an overall "scorecard" that tracks exactly how each character stands relative to Endgame, and how the in-game events affect the score.                        </div>

                            Eliot, <br/><br/>I think I agree with that. In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1776" rel="nofollow">John's spin off from this thread</a> I did a bit about how in Dogs you end up doing that a lot as you push for smaller stakes. Like a player saying "I find the murderer and reform them" as their stakes isn't going to stand in a game of Dogs, but as you negotiate it down to something doable you'll probably figure out some possible paths for future conflicts to move the situation that direction.                        </div>
