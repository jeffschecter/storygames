So yeah! Go for it if your group has an easy time jugglig that!<br/><br/>I tend to think Locations are the most advanced element, requiring the most finesse to really make good use of. Objects are, often, almost honorary Needs, in a way. A suitcase full of money? Oh, you KNOW that is some plot-driving shit, right there.<br/><br/>My first Fiasco game, we played the touring rock band, and our Location was the old abandoned farm pasture, or whatever it is. We found it wasn't really central the way the other Details were, though it did finally provide the backdrop for a pivotal scene. It's taken awhile to get the hang of makig Locations a big deal in play, and some are trickier than others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
