The only time I've gone looking for Actual Play is if I wanted a better idea of how to run it. Case in point: When I first got PTA and was getting ready to run it, I was terrified of fucking it up, and grabbed every Actual Play I could find, in addition to advice threads. Sometimes, I'll read an actual play over a game I own and like just to see how other people are doing it. I treat Actual Plays as Examples of Play in the book, except I know they're real world examples. <br/><br/>I never seek them out for a game I don't own. Now, someone might point me to an actual play, which might sell me on a game, but that hasn't happened yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110823/#Comment_110823" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T16:02:28+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  4:02PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good actual play reports can push me one or two steps towards purchasing it (or away from it, if the report is negative).<br/><br/>So if I was like "Pffft!  Whatever!" about a game, a good and positive actual play might get me to "That's sort of interesting."  If I'm already at "That's sort of interesting," it might take me to "Hey, that's cool!"  If I already think "Hey, that's cool!" it could tip me directly into "Here's my money!"  And, just for the sake of completeness, if the money has already been spent, a good actual play will put me squarely in the warm glow of "God damn, that's an awesome game."<br/><br/>A good and negative actual play report might knock me down a peg or two on that same scale.<br/><br/><br/>Of course, what I consider to be a good actual play report might not necessarily match what someone else would like.  I like 'em to mix both the story of the game they played (the characters, the plot, etc.) with the story of HOW they played it (comments on the mechanics used in certain sections, comparisons to other systems, stuff that different people in their group liked or disliked); just one without the other won't cut it for me.  And on top of all that, I want it to make me laugh at least once or twice, either by being written in an especially witty way, or by being impressively cool in its own right; it might not shift my opinion about the game itself, but it will definitely make the author of the report seem more like the kind of person I want to listen to.<br/><br/>To me, bad actual play reports are the ones which aren't informative.  They might still be entertaining, but they're not going to figure noticeably into any purchasing decisions I might make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110826/#Comment_110826" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T16:05:51+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  4:05PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the pedagogical aspect of AP reports, where you can read about common mistakes and often head them off at the pass in your own play.

But that's partly because I'm a miser.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlurbs about a game are unreliable; mechanical innovation isn't a pull for me; subject matter is enticing but often disappointing in implementation.  The only thing that matters to me is what happens at the table, and in lieu of personal experience I've got to rely on others'.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only trouble with using this as a guide is that a lot of great games probably don't get sufficient attention, and therefore I (and people like me) do not buy them because there's just not enough solid AP to justify the purchase.

I was just asking because I'm wondering about trying to put together some sort of AP/Reviewing incentive scheme. I figure, with games coming out so thick and fast right now, most people won't buy a game until they've played it, and the authors are having a hell of a time getting their games played outside of the circle of people they know. I'm hoping that providing people with AP will help them make the choice to play without the convention demo experience, and encouraging them to then post their own AP shows a)that its being played outwith the writer's direct auspices and b) that there are lots of cool ideas and gameplay happening, hopefully encouraging more people to try out the game to get their own fun experiences.<br><br>More responses good - tell me more!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass" title="BigJackBrass"><img alt="BigJackBrass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/576/nNQFOT4MURTFT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass">BigJackBrass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111075/#Comment_111075" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T02:52:51+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  2:52AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2007 2:54AM by BigJackBrass.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>In my imaginary magical fantasyland, every game in existence would have mp3s available of a group playing at least one entire session of it.</blockquote>\nThere are a surprising number out there, growing all the time, although the peculiar thing is how many groups seem to end up playing the same game. My group supplies some audio for the RPGMP3.com site, which was probably the first "actual play" (prior to my involvement - I'm not bragging here) with their mammoth forty session slog through <i>The World's Largest Dungeon</i>. Generally we try some of the less generally known games (such as <i>Best Friends</i>) along with old standards like <i>Traveller</i>, but we're never going to be able to play everything and we certainly don't treat every game we play to a review session. Hal and Lindsay, who run the site, usually play <i>D&amp;D</i> or <i>CoC</i> (which gets excellent audio coverage on Yog Radio too).<br><br>I started recording our sessions because I enjoyed listening to things like RPGMP3.com and also thought it might be handy to have a full record of the games for GMing purposes. They haven't been aimed at presenting a balanced view of the games, although several posters on the site's forum have bought games like <i>Truth &amp; Justice</i> because they heard our audio. Personally I've yet to be directly influenced to the point of purchase by "actual play" audio, although one or two have made me look deeper into games of which I was only passingly aware, and I never read "actual play" reports. <br/><br/>One thing to note: Anyone interested in RPGMP3s audio can find some of it on the download page or via iTunes, but the majority is (at present) linked from the forum and that requires registration to view, plus a small contribution if you fancy becoming a Patron. I mention this merely because I know not everyone likes being pointed towards sites they have to sign up for.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111742/#Comment_111742" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T16:50:51+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  4:50PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actual Play reports have sold me on a game, but I basically never read them for games I'm not already interested in.

No one wants a bad review of their game (well, okay, some people do; MOST people don't want one, though) but people need to believe that the glowing AP reports are not there because of your incentive only, or else they'll lose their impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111750/#Comment_111750" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T17:19:03+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  5:19PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't even begin to imagine the horror of listening to an AP podcast. <br/><br/>I read AP reports only very occasionally, with an eye toward uncovering problems and how to solve them.<br/><br/>Ironically, I wrote some fairly lengthy AP threads when I was hashing out Burning Empires and Burning Wheel.
