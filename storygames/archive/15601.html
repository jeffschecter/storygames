Players will portray characters that wield supernatural powers with little or no constraint.

Your character must find their way through life, while living under a bloody shadow. What path will you choose? Your character faces a strict code of conduct and internal turmoil.</blockquote>\nI mean, aren't all rpgs set in some kind of world gone wrong? &amp;... is the "no constaint" a, like, system thing? So we're playing free-form? Or an in-game societal thing, so i should think that we're all really emotional loose cannons (which makes me think of certain anime films)? &amp;... what darkness? &amp; then so the world was saved but now it's fucked up again &amp; people are looking to my character to save it again, i guess. That's cool. The last sentence is too comical, though, because it reads as if my strict code is of both (a) internal turmoil and (b) confllict.<br/>(edit: And the coloquial saying is "inner turmoil"; "internal turmoil" makes me think it's like a digestive problem, which is decidedly not epic.)<br/><br/>I'm not trying to be snarky, so sorry if it comes off that way.<br/>First step: explain what your game is about &amp; what the players of it do, &amp; why the doing of that is fun.<br/>I'm feeling out of my depth right now, maybe other people who are more familiar with the game should comment &amp; i'll sit back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353734/#Comment_353734" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T10:02:05+00:00" title="January 10, 2012 10:02AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2012 10:17AM by Mathalus.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Give us your elevator pitch, Dave.

So, I wrote one. I set it in a steampunk era with a heavy emphasis on the 'punk. Finally, I added magic and superscience to give non-vampires a chance. The characters are mechanically able to change the world and progress towards that change is player driven.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a game about steampunk?<br/>\n  I have been toying with the idea of doing a vampire game for a while and when I latched on to the idea of setting it in a steampunk setting, that is what got my motor going.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr about vampire wizards?<br/>\n  So, the main idea is that the PCs are vampires. You can play a vampire that hasn't manifested any powers or you can play a vampire or you can play a vampire that wants to reform, but you will play a character who has the curse of the magi.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, aren't all rpgs set in some kind of world gone wrong?<br/>\n  I don't know, I thought D&amp;D was about leaving the normal world to battle dragons in dungeons. this is a more 'punk setting, so wherever you go, it will be dystopian (ideally).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the "no constaint" a, like, system thing?<br/>\n  I guess, I mean there is nothing stopping a player from having heir character vamp out, get every vampire power in their first scene and start killing innocent civilians. but there is also nothign stopping them from taking one or two vampire powers and using them to protect the innocent. The game has a major creative conecssion, you play a character with a vampire curse, what you do with that curse is up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we're playing free-form?<br/>\n  I'd say it is not rules light, but not rules heavy. Basically, if there is a conflict, you roll three dice, assign one towards achieving your goal, one to affect the character stopping you and one to defend against that opposing character. There are Action Type and character Stats that let you modify those dice, but they won't be enough to overcome a bad roll (or ruin a good one).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat darkness?<br/>\n  So, the premise works like this, you are born cursed. A Dhampir, a human who will turn into a vampire if you fall to temptation. As soon as your character is desperate enough and wanting to commit a dishonorable act, they can manifest Vampire powers and begin needing human blood to survive. I? don't know about you, but I think that is pretty dark.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the world was saved but now it's fucked up again &amp; people are looking to my character to save it again<br/>\n  Basically the idea is to have the Vampires be in a moral grey area. they are cursed because they saved the world over 5,000 years ago. Before they were cursed that had a pretty strict code of conduct, not it is an albatross around their neck. Finally, I hint at the idea that if Vampires kill a number of people equal to those saved 5,000 year ago, then maybe the curse would be lifted. So, that means that the most murderous vampires might actually be the good guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy strict code is:<br/>\n  So, I wanted the players and GM to be able to tell a good character from an evil one. I pout together the Code of the Magi, if you do something on the list you are doing good. If you do something else, it is evil.there is an alignment tracker and you can use your alignment score to give you a temporary bonus. If you can see the back cover of the book, the entire code is on the back cover (for easy reference).<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I eat a person?<br/>\n  Yes, in fact a player who insisted that they would play a hero in the game manifested vampire powers and killed an innocent miner in their first scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I build crazy steam powered stuff?<br/>\n  Yes, your character can essentially make anything that can be made with Victorian technology and then add one thing that can't be made with Victorian<br/>\n technology (like adding a howitzer to a dirigible).<br/>\n<br/>\n  By the way, I did mention that I suck at marketing. Thanks for all your help so far. I look forward to more good advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There are a ton of other cool features, mechanics and aspects to the game I want to talk about, but I don't know which ones matter to anyone but me...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354015/#Comment_354015" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T19:40:35+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  7:40PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should say that you can put a howitzer on a dirigible.

But yeah, totally change that cover. Anyway, two little comments.<br/><br/>Putting a howitzer on a dirigible sounds like it would be an awful idea in real life, but it's totally sweet. I'd do that in an RPG any day, and it would go a long way to establish the kind of tone you're trying to cultivate.<br/><br/>"I mean, aren't all rpgs set in some kind of world gone wrong?" Not necessarily. A lot of the time in 'punk settings it's dystopian, which might be considered gone wrong, but maybe not. However, there does exist a niche for games that DON'T happen in a world gone wrong - the most visible I can think of would be Freemarket. It's a pretty tight niche, but I just wanted to mention that you CAN do that if you really so choose.<br/>Also I like the phrase ideally dystopian. It just sounds nice to me. Anyway, good luck with this, I'll be keeping an eye on it <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
