It largely covered the first chapter and my thoughts on the setting.  My conclusion was that the tone of the setting was inconsistent.  That sometimes it felt like the book was describing this highly romanticized sweeping swords &amp; sorcery setting and sometimes it felt like pages and pages of describing rather mundane feudal world.  This wobbling tone lead to some pretty wonky interaction between setting elements that I\u2019m not known for spotting or caring about, so they have to be pretty darn wonky.  However, I found John\u2019s answer to the wonkiest of them on the Houses of the Blooded forum which at least convinced me that my root confusion is at best a minor one.<br/><br/>So rather than repeat everything I said yesterday let me move on to my thoughts on the system.  Caveat: I\u2019m only up to the Poison chapter.  My opinion will refine as I read more but I\u2019ve at least gotten through the basics.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s the deal.  Page 140 of the .pdf pretty much killed all my interest in playing the game.  On p. 140 the text basically admits the game is competitive.  As I was reading that was the vibe I was getting from the rules in general and then page 140 spelled it out.  If it\u2019s not admitting the game is competitive it\u2019s basically admitting that the game is designed to allow for and enable competitive players.  And I can\u2019t play competitively with this material.  That\u2019s on me though, not the game.<br/><br/>Actually, I think the game is very good.  If you were into the social manipulation aspects of Vampire, at all then I HIGHLY recommend what I\u2019ve read so far.  The game so far I think is highly functional for promoting quality Step On Up in a social arena to get all Big Model about it.<br/><br/>Let me start with the Privilege issue since I made such a big issue out of it.  The text convinced me it\u2019s a non-issue.  What makes it work for me is all the limits the text puts on the \u201cwho says\u201d aspect of Privilege.  First of all intentions are declared openly and are \u201cin character.\u201d  And while the roll does not determine the success or failure the person who wins the role is *limited* to Yay or Nay on that intention and then Wagers allow for the finite \u201cnegotiation\u201d of consequences.  Also Wagers can not be used to bypass something that would be another risk.<br/><br/>So you see, it isn\u2019t a \u201cconch shell\u201d passing game at all.  The mechanics do not simply determine \u201cwho speaks\u201d and that person can not just ramble on about everything that happens.  There is no ambiguous, \u201cnarrate the outcome\u201d   Notice that my stance on PtA is that the High Card player is limited to the *immediate* consequences of the achievement or loss of the in-character Stakes and can not ramble on indefinitely either.<br/><br/>This kind of excited me.  I was actually smiling when I saw how it all worked.  The one issue I thought was going to be the deal breaker for me on Houses of the Blooded wasn\u2019t.  And then I got to the very next paragraph and it all got ruined: The rules on lying.<br/><br/>No.  I almost stopped reading right there.  I will not play a game which allows for *players* lying to each other.  The text is ambiguous about \u201cwhy you might want to do it.\u201d  I know why you might want to do it and I won\u2019t have that at my table.  That\u2019s death of my fun right there.  Game over.  Good bye Houses of the Blooded.<br/><br/>I was very dubious back in the character creation chapter with all the secret name and secret tags and secret compel stuff (only Houses could make Aspects a WORSE mechanic for me) but the lying rules during resolution confirmed those fears.  The text on page 140 pretty much put the nail in the coffin.  \u201cHouses of the Blooded\u201d is not a game for me.<br/><br/>I will keep reading and I will let you know if that opinion changes.  This really breaks my heart.  It really does.  I\u2019ve wanted a game about Revenge for a very long time.  Revenge is a topic that interests me greatly.  But alas I\u2019m reminded of Colin\u2019s example use of Privilege in my previous thread, \u201cIt\u2019s everything I want, given to me exactly the way I don\u2019t want it.\u201d<br/><br/>Again, I want to confirm that I think the game is very very good.  Anyone who wants a Diplomacy-esq RPG about Politics, Romance and Revenge, I HIGHLY recommend it.  It\u2019s John\u2019s best work.  It just isn\u2019t for me.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172147/#Comment_172147" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T12:39:33+00:00" title="September 30, 2008 12:39PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, you're probably not going to like this answer, but you could just house rule "no lying."<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of secrets and reveals in gaming myself and would propbably make all of it open secrets between the players anyway.

In fact almost everything I'd house rule John has explicitly spelled out the very alternative I would use in text.  But those are only patches.  I really don't like Aspects, for example.  I don't like them in SotC, I like them less in Houses.  And there just comes a point where I've house ruled the thing so much that I'm not really playing the game at hand, I'm playing something else and at that point I'd rather just play something else that does work for me wholesale.<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>The lying thing puts me off because it allows for bluffing and goading at the player level.  It would allow you to do something like this:  You declare that your character is taking some action.  I decide my character would take a stand against that action so I have him step up to confront your character.  We roll, but then you lie about the outcome because you deliberately want to give me the advantage hoping that the way I trounce your character gives you the rational to have your character do something else perhaps even more grand against my character.<br/><br/>At that point the investment at the player level isn't about setting up dramatic confrontations and then waiting with baited breath to see the outcome and exploring the fallout from that.  The investment is instead in using manipulation tactics to engineer the story you want.  "If I can get player X to do Y that will enable me to do Z" thinking.  That's what makes the game socially competitive.<br/><br/>I don't know if there's a section that explicitly outlines The Cut Throat vs. The Friendly Game.  With what I've read so far the text very much feels like The Cut Throat game is the intended effect with The Friendly Game being a concession, a kind of "Well, if you must, here's another way to play."  I don't know whether that's your intention or not but the text makes me feel like I'm not *really* playing the game as it was intended in the non-Cut Throat manner.<br/><br/>Even then I'm not so sure I'd enjoy The Friendly Game anyway for the same reasons I don't like Spirit of the Century.  What would be left if you remove The Cut Throat elements is basically a celebration of already established themes as defined by the character's Aspects and Houses.  Which is not something I enjoy anymore.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172158/#Comment_172158" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T13:17:21+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  1:17PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finish reading the book, then tell me what you think.

(Presented with authority and confidence).  Then there's a side bar or a secondary paragraph with kind of an apologetic tone of, "But.... if that doesn't work for you, here's another way."  It makes the "other way" appear like the "lesser" way.  Like the designer is second guessing himself, is unsure of his own game and is making concessions to please those who don't share the intended play goals.<br/><br/>Example:  There's an ENTIRE chapter dedicated to the Invoke, Tag and Compel thing and about how they should be specific and do ONE and only ONE thing.  Repeated over and over.  Example after Example.  And then at the end one little paragraph about opening them up so that the work more like they do in Spirit of the Century.<br/><br/>They are not presented as Mode A vs. Mode B. as equals.  One is presented as "how this game was designed" and the other is presented, "for those who don't like that."<br/><br/>I believe that was not your intention but the textual presentation makes me feel that way.

I pegged it as a competitive game along the lines of Amber along the way, too, but ultimately decided that insofar as there is a designer preference for what you should be playing, it's slightly leaning towards collaborative story creation. The Aspect specificity thing, for instance, doesn't seem to me like it facilitates competitive gamism so much as reins in character power in an effort to keep the players under control. That's an important function for either of the two default modes, but perhaps more so for the cooperative story-telling one, as it seems to me that its intended to keep players focused on the limitations of their envisioned character concept, as opposed to limitless empowering.<br/><br/>As for rules coherence, it seems to me that you won't be finding it here, simply because that's not what John's written in or what he believes in as a function of the game design text. HoB does not present you with an unified vision of a social situation and tools to make an agenda work for you; it gives you lots of fiction, rules that describe that fiction and a bunch of alternative procedures that you pick and choose to build your own, specific game out of. That's just the way it is, and it'd be extremely artificial to try to force the game text into being just about your own preferred reading, whatever it is. The two alternative modes of play are just an explicit example of this sort of thing, but there's plenty more of independent negotiation you need to be doing to adapt the small details to make a coherent game out of it all. That's not such a big deal if you approach the game rules with a strong personal vision for what you think you want the game to be doing, and modify accordingly.<br/><br/>Those are interesting thoughts about Privilege. Perhaps I'll reread the game with those in mind at some point, myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172176/#Comment_172176" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T14:57:54+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  2:57PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Jesse, you're after the "Friendly Game" bit, which is, IIRC, near the end.  <em>Houses</em> is a toolbox game, not a laser-like focus game.

In fact almost everything I'd house rule John has explicitly spelled out the very alternative I would use in text.  But those are only patches.  I really don't like Aspects, for example.  I don't like them in SotC, I like them less in Houses.  And there just comes a point where I've house ruled the thing so much that I'm not really playing the game at hand, I'm playing something else and at that point I'd rather just play something else that does work for me wholesale.</blockquote>Yeah, I told you that you wouldn't care for my answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172219/#Comment_172219" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T19:17:19+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  7:17PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Really?
