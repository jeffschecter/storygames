There was a large number and broad variety of freeforms at this year's GenCon Oz, and people came from all over the country to participate in them. A large contingent of players traveled half the country from Adelaide. There are more experienced freeformers than myself that visit this forum and they will hopefully chime in here. I know nothing about freeforms in other countries, so let me just describe what they are like here;<br>\nFreeforms have been around a long time in Australia (I remember a book being published about them waaaay back in the early 1990's, when LARPS seemed to be popular in England and other places). Australian LARPing is relatively new and not as common as freeforms.  Australian freeforms tend to be REALLY rules lite (a lot don't actually have game rules, just social contracts on appropriate behaviour) - the setting and characters are paramount. Most freeforms are written with a general setting (Revolution France, outback Australia, a funeral, a steampunk airship) and characters with specific agendas. Many freeforms are "scaleable" for different sized groups, perhaps starting with a half-dozen to dozen characters with interlinked (or opposed) agendas or goals, then other characters might be added in with more related goals, or new sets of agendas that still tie in with those that have already been introduced. The idea is to create reasons for all characters to interact with each other. In preparing for a freeform you might indicate a preference for a particular kind of character ("I want to be arrogant.", "Is there someone sneaky?") and a well organised event might see you notified in advance with details of your character and (if relevent) suggestions for costumes. Some people get really into the event, costuming and the like, while others just come along as they are - there are usually no expectations about this and most freeforms have a mix of both. There might be a "central plot", but not to the point where other character's stories are relegated to the sidelines - everyone should feel like they have something to do. Here is a brief overview of a freeform run at last year's GenCon Oz, as way of example (I did not attend this, a friend did);<br>\n<br/>\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel<br/>\nThe infamous Scarlet Pimpernel is rumoured to be attending a lavish ball. The French Government wants to discover the identity of this rogue, the British noblemen want to make contact and make further arrangements. Some Frenchmen are sympathetic to the Pimpernel's cause, while some British noblemen think his capture will do them good. Some people want to escape France and need the Scarlet Pimpernel's help. Some noblemen are suspicious of their wive's or sons or friends for one reason or the other and are either trying to get to the truth, or have hired others to get answers for them, or are trying to hire others. Some women are looking for husbands or lovers. Some men are trying to hide their indescretions from their wives. In short, it is all the intrigue you would expect to find at a royal ball.<br/>\nEach player was provided with a brief background of their character, including their goals for the event. Then they were let loose in the ball room. Whatever happened next would hopefully be driven by the players keeping in character, seeking ways to further their own agendas, which would hoepfully involve talking to lots of people and having heaps of fun. <br/>\nNote that no goals involved killing, fighting or other physical conflict - just the discovering of secrets, revelations of histories and identities and that kind of thing. I think this is the key to avoiding the need for heavy-handed GM's, atmosphere breaking dice rolls and overly detailed character sheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this has helped clarify a little about Australian freeforms. I also hope someone with more recent experience chimes in to clean up any gross mistakes I have made - Vulpinoid, perhaps?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nNathan                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peril%20Planet" title="Peril Planet"><img alt="Peril Planet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peril%20Planet">Peril Planet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241560/#Comment_241560" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-11T23:52:35+00:00" title="November 11, 2009 11:52PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I just found a great link about designing freeforms.

She's actually one of the individuals in the seminar from the previous post.<br/><br/>In short, freeforms tend to be games with 20+ players. They typically have a ratio of 1 GM to every 5 players. Each player has a group of agendas that they are trying to achieve, these agendas link them to other player's characters (either as allies, or enemies...and often forcing them into moral dilemmas where they have to choose which agendas to pursue). In freeforms, characters typically don't have attributes or numbers on their character sheets at all, instead they have a page or two of personal background, possibly a page of factional background, and possibly a page of general background shared by all players. In freeforms, costuming tends to be common. It's all about story and style, and not about mechanics at all.<br/><br/>Simjames made a comment about Australian Freeforming being similar to jeepform in a thread here a few months back (he's also been involved in creating some great freeforms over the years). \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: simjames</cite>I guess I need a new word for the games I like, then. :O  It's a shame that we speak English here, or I could just use the same words in a different language and claim that it's an entirely distinct term.<br/><br/><img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Jeepform has some similarities to Aust. freeforms, but there are some pretty noticeable differences too. There are some techniques that I'd love to lift, but others that seem quite incompatible.</blockquote>\nOn the whole, Nathan got it pretty right with his description though.<br/><br/>Multiforming traditionally combines aspects of freeform gaming and tabletop gaming. Multiforming was around long before White Wolf "revolutionised gaming" with their Minds Eye Theater system, but this system could easily be considered a multiform, it's a LARP system but it's got too many rules to truly be considered a freeform in the Australian sense. <br/><br/>I've been participating in this style of gaming for almost 20 years, so I'll try to expand this further for anyone who's got further questions about this style of gaming. I think I made a blog post about it specifically a few months back...I'll see what I can find.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241577/#Comment_241577" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T04:43:32+00:00" title="November 12, 2009  4:43AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys, do you have any links to stand-alone freeforms, with characters, plot points, etc?

A badly written freeform can suffer when a single player doesn't pursue their agendas, a badly GM'd freeform can suffer when a minority of players are sapping the attention of the GMs and leaving the majority floundering...I've been in both of these situations. A good critical mass of players can rescue such a freeform, as long as the Gms are willing to run with them (rather than against them).<br/><br/>My wife and I are actually writing up a Serenity based freeform for Gencon Oz next year. The tentative premise is a festivity on one of the mid-to-outer planets, where there are still a lot of Browncoat sympathizers, as well as alliance supporters. Most characters tentatively fall on one side or the other within that spectrum. But each character will also have secondary agendas regarding criminal activities, religious beliefs, financial wheeling-and-dealing, etc. <br/><br/>We've set up a few key moments in the game when certain events will trigger to help push the storyline along if certain players aren't pursuing their goals vigorously enough. For example, if one cluster of players haven't managed to gather within the first half hour, then a certain trigger event will occur; if they do manage to gather, then they delay the interruption to the festivities. If they haven't managed to pool their resources and notify a GM that their background influences are being used in a certain way, then a nasty surprise will hit in the last half hour of the session. Meanwhile another group of players is looking for people who are trying t stop the event, so that they can perform counter-sabotage.<br/><br/>I try to have at least a dozen potential events of this nature in any freeform style game that I write, each player being linked to at least three of them in some way...this way players have too many things to keep track of. Once an event hits, I like to see at least a quarter of the room raising their fists in the air, cheering or smiling...another quarter grimacing, scowling or outright swearing...while the remaining half are saying "What the f???" and wondering what might happen later to screw up their plans. Such events should be motivators for less active players.<br/> <br/>Freeforms should have a good central premise. Some examples include a grand feast, a diplomatic negotiation, a sinking ship, the launch party for a vessel, the inauguration for a president, a blackout at an asylum...something to lure players in from the outset. The potential critical events take the plot on wild twists and turns unless players counteract them, a well written and GM'd freeform also allows for players to take the situation in their own directions. Like most games, there's nothing more frustrating than spending two hours in a freeform concocting an elaborate plot to manipulate the story with a dozen other players only to have the GM say "No".<br/><br/>On the positive side at many cons(even with the most aimless examples), freeforms are now turning into good ways to lure Cosplayers into the deeper world of roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peril%20Planet" title="Peril Planet"><img alt="Peril Planet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peril%20Planet">Peril Planet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241915/#Comment_241915" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T19:06:31+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  7:06PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Vulpinoid, that's great news about a Serenity freeform.

What do they do?</blockquote>\nMany GMs take a backseat role, offering players encouragement or providing personal scene to players who don't seem to be active in the overall session. Other GMs handle situations when a conflict develops and that conflict can't be resolved through social means. In some cases GMs will take on lesser roles within the story, such as servants or spies who might be able to give plot impetus to characters who are looking for clues to further the unfolding situation. GMs are typically marked by specific garments (red armbands...hats marked with the letters "GM"...or something similar that is made clear to everyone at the start of play).\n<blockquote>How much do people get in character? Is there crying &amp; angst, or more entertainment &amp; laughs?</blockquote>\nA freeform will typically start with a known premise...I've played in a freeform based on the collected works of Clive Barker, another based on a pair of FBI agents named Mulder and Scully investigating a surreal town called Cicely in Alaska (based on a cross between the X Files and Northern Exposure), some based on pirate ships, others based in the halls of power behind a solar-system presidential election, one based in hell where the players were all lesser demons.<br><br>The type of player typically lured to a freeform tends to be a dramatic type, so moments in the limelight are often a common scene. Players beforehand will quickly resolve a scene with the aid of a GM then they will ad-lib the scene in front of a crowd so that everyone elses agendas may be impacted by what has occured. Crying, laughing and angst are very common in this roleplaying environment, but the specific emotion varies depending on the premise for the game...melodrama is also common (though it may be welcome in some scenarios and unwelcome in others).\n<blockquote>How important is plot?</blockquote>\nSome play to immerse themselves in setting, others play to further plot through fulfilling the agendas of their own characters or factions. A well written freeform will develop storylines and plots through the agendas of the characters imvolved. \n<blockquote>If I go to a freeform and get heavily immersive, is that good or bad?</blockquote>\nImmersive play is the aim of a freeform, getting into character and forgetting that there are any rules is a very good thing. Costuming is heavily encouraged, as are accents, and background research in the setting.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242061/#Comment_242061" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T14:47:45+00:00" title="November 15, 2009  2:47PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a link a Gloranthan freeform on Nick Brooke (one of the authors) page: <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~nick_brooke/moonson/index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.btinternet.com/~nick_brooke/moonson/index.htm</a><br><br>You can get a view of the setup from this - a set of characters in conflict.

In Ascolais and Almery, lands to the west of the Falling Wall, live a group of magicians who have formed an association the better to protect their interests. The magicians of the 21st Aeon are a disparate and uncertain group, lacking both grandeur and consistency. Gathered in colloquy, they seemed an assembly of rare and wonderful birds, each most mindful of his own plumage. After a number of unhappy incidents they were persuaded to regulate themselves by a code of conduct. This code, known as 'the Monstrament', or, less formally, 'the Blue Principles', was engraved upon a blue prism which was housed in a secret place. The association included the most notable magicians of the region. By unanimous acclaim, Zilifant was proclaimed Preceptor, and invested with large powers. <br/>- Adapted from Rhialto the Marvellous by Jack Vance.<br/><br/>Once every ten years the wizards of Ascolais gather for a conclave at which they elect a preceptor for the following decade, or until the sun goes out. This election has been brought forward by the disappearance of Zilifant giving even great urgency to electing a new leader. The conclave is always followed by an extravagant festival of gourmandery. It is even rumoured that Turbosse \xe0 la Mosse will be served for only the second time this Aeon. <br/><br/>As apprentices, you are billeted in the annex of Zilifant's manse whilst the masters debate matters of great import in the Grand Library. The manse is in the wild woods where ferocious creatures such as asp, deodand and the usual hoon wander, perilous to all travellers. They are only kept from the manse by the memory of fearsome defensive magics. To wander there unprotected is folly indeed.<br/><br/>You are woken just before dawn by a great clanging bell. One of the servants is ringing the stable bell while the others are forming a human chain between the pump in the yard and the manse, which burns fiercely. Soon the conflagration is out, but the house and the magicians inside are ashes. The servants summon you to the kitchen of the annex, where, looking grave, they are about to impart to you details of a dire prophecy\u2026<br/><br/>There are 3 locations in this game. The Annex comprises two, the dormitories and the kitchens (fit only for servants). The other is the great smouldering clearing where Zilifant's manse once stood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242065/#Comment_242065" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T15:04:56+00:00" title="November 15, 2009  3:04PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here's a character:<br/><br/>1.Gollzard - Apprentice to Gilgad<br/>He was a small man with a grey face. His hands were clammy, cold and damp. His touch was avoided by all.<br/><br/>Well, he\u2019s dead but you won\u2019t be shedding any tears. After all, he\u2019s been dead for quite some time, hasn\u2019t he? Two hundred and fifty six years, in fact. Two hundred and thirty three less than you.  And this is the traditional way for the undead to go. <br/><br/>But before he went he taught you so much. You feel your master was an undiscovered genius \u2013 probably the finest necromancer of his generation. A few turns of the moon ago, Gilgad embarked upon the most ambitious magical project of his career, a ritual for which even the gathering of the spell components had taken three hundred years. Tonight, the feast marking the end of the conclave, was to see the culmination of this ritual. Gilgad would harness the little power left in the waning sun to create his own tiny world where he would reign supreme. And you? His right-hand man, of course, and a right-good princeling you\u2019d make.<br/><br/>But now he\u2019s gone \u2013 how tragic! More tragic is that his demise sets the ritual back some years. If you can discover the missing elements then there\u2019s nothing to stop you becoming Emperor of the new world in your own right. Becoming Treasurer of this miserable collection of hedge-wizards and eccentrics would be a start.<br/><br/>Who could help? There are other diabolists here, all your brothers in devilry, but you trust them about as much as they trust you, which is about as much as the kindness of a deodand. Still, they are allies in a sense. One thing you do remember is that the climax of the ritual involves the sacrifice of a magician. Gilgad crowed over the fact that Rhialto, that buffoon, that disgrace to the name Magician, was to die today. Then all the power in the world would be Gilgad\u2019s. Now this is his legacy to you.<br/>Weakness:<br/>Single-minded<br/>Drivers:<br/>You want to be treasurer<br/>You hate Rhialto and his apprentice<br/>You want diabolists to rule the roost                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242066/#Comment_242066" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T15:07:53+00:00" title="November 15, 2009  3:07PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here's a ritual<br/><br/>The Expedient Proxy<br/>This dark hex calls on the necromantic arts to fashion a synthetic replacement.
