Notable for high mortality rates among characters. An example of Situation. Term coined by Ralph Mazza, Jake Norwood, and Ron Edwards.</i><br/><br/>I think this is sort of what In a Wicked Age does. What other games do you know that fall into this category? What game mechanics are best used for this kind of game?<br/><br/>A little bit of background: I've played a game of IAWA recently and I noticed a few things that irked me. Now I'm trying to find out what I can do about it, or how other games do it differently.

Building complex, compelling, gameable situations is something some good gaming technology could help with. <br/><br/>I find it works best when I pregenerate the characters. When I set up blood operas, I tend to have lots of ties between characters that are based on blood and sex. I also try to have two or three issues that have to be dealt with, each of which has two or three different positions that people can take. For instance, on the issue "Should we continue to give service to the Imperial overlords?" people can take positions of "Yes, as we become rich while doing the service," "Yes, as revolt would be too costly," and "No, we should regain our independence." You then have different characters take those different positions. With a few issues, you can make sure that no-one entirely agrees with anyone about everything. Throw in a few personal issues ("My best ally in council stole my wife.") and let the fun ensue!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
