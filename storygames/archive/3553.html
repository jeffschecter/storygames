This idea came to me today while thinking about... I don't even know what.<br/><br/>While many indie games don't require "support" in the way of regular supplements, there might be a way to do something like it.  I think it would work even better with more "traditional" games.<br/><br/>Imagine that each sourcebook was focused on a "way to play".  This assumes a game that isn't as focused as some indie games, and is more open to going in different directions.  Less "My Life with Master" and more "The Shadow of Yesterday".  Each sourcebook would be like, "Ok, you're military types stuck on a post at war with alien bug-monsters" or "You're nobles at court, vying for rights to a recently unearthed complex full of powerful McGuffins".  Then it gives you a lovely "situation generator" to roll on, coming up with some cool elements for your characters to interact with this session (or arc or whatever), kind of like the thing in InSpecters and Grey Ranks(?).  Then the rest of the book would be material like extra rules (if needed) or stats (if needed) or just advice on neat things that you can do with the elements you rolled.  All of it would be thematically tied to the main "idea" of the book.  It might include setting material or not, depending on tastes, but it would all be "optional" and focused on the situational element that spawned it.<br/><br/>What do you think?  I'd love to see something like that for Fading Suns.  Poor game.  I love the setting, but the rules stink.  I should give it the TSoY treatment.  That would probably rock.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80098/#Comment_80098" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-08T13:17:45+00:00" title="July  8, 2007  1:17PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a great idea.

The game is about making decisions on behalf of a community and so situations are really complex packages - they involve external threats, the potential to seed internal threats, a host of strengths and powers, and a host of ramifications and consequences.<br/><br/>I'm working on what will eventually be a really tight, smooth situation generator. At the same time, I plan to do some supplements with pregenerated situations and threats. The supplements in this ideal vision of the game walk you through the thought process in constructing them, how they are meant to be played, and what kinds of campaigns they were designed to be introduced into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80365/#Comment_80365" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T07:03:15+00:00" title="July 10, 2007  7:03AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is something I planned to do for <b>Fastlane</b> a long time ago, and never did.<br/><br/>Now that it's almost time for a second printing, maybe I'll get off my butt and start making them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80366/#Comment_80366" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T07:08:56+00:00" title="July 10, 2007  7:08AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a balance to be walked here, I think ... or at least, the potential for this to appeal to different types of purchasers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhite Wolf splat-books did a terrific job of providing inspiration about situation and tension.  <i>But</i>, they did a crummy job of actually giving you a systematic way to get something from the book quickly (or at all).  You could spend a lot of time reading the book, and if that was your reward, great!  But if you were trying to <i>save time overall</i> by reading the book then you were out of luck.  An hour's reading did not make your prep-time an hour easier.  The splat-books were cool in a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast, when you're talking about situation generators, I imagine something where ten minutes of reading saves me thirty minutes of prep time.  That is cool in its own way, but it doesn't necessarily provide the same reward for just flat out pleasure-reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure these two things even, really, complement each other.  It may be that trying to get both things strongly in one book would be ... challenging.

In other words if Group A and B hate each other, it actually reduces overall tension if there is a faction in A and B that like each other.

Maybe I was using the books the way they intended - they never actually tell you how you're intended to use the supplements, splatbooks or non-splatbooks. In that case you'd be right.
