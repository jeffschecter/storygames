I started it in tandem with Blade &amp; Crown, but neither requires the other. And I've been thinking for a long time of making the wiki for my fantasy game-world public. Getting paid to develop a deep, well-maintained, self-consistent game-world? Yes, please. <br/><br/>I can't figure out how to try to fund it, though. I'm tempted to make it a Kickstarter to explicitly fund me to work on it for a couple years. Once funded, I'd upload what I already have (currently about 210 MB), then after a couple years, make everything created up to then CC or public domain. Patreon makes sense, too, but I don't know how to structure it in a way that seems fair -- per month? Per article? (But some articles are short and some are really long.) Per MB of data? (But that makes images literally worth way more than words.) <br/><br/>What do y'all think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430780/#Comment_430780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T01:24:16+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  1:24AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Per article" works even if not articles are equal.

Most of the strictly world-building kickstarters I've backed have been relatively modest (aiming for a 100 page supplement most of the time.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jiawen" title="Jiawen"><img alt="Jiawen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/292/nR08RUP20JH7I.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jiawen">Jiawen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430832/#Comment_430832" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T20:46:55+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  8:46PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, guess I'd like to aim for something surer than just "see what happens". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And yeah, it seems like the best way to be successful in RPGs is... to already be successful. But hopefully I'm starting to get my name and abilities out there. Blade &amp; Crown has been out for over a year now, and I've been blogging steadily since then. I hope to finish the first adventure for B&amp;C soon, and I've had tons of setting material on my personal website for more than a decade. So while I may not be a big name, I've been around for a while.<br/><br/>So far as I've seen, this would be a whole new thing. Kind of like Mark Rosenfelder's <a href="http://www.almeopedia.com/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Almeopedia</a>, but geared more specifically for gaming and, eventually, downloadable. And unlike a lot of Kickstarter projects, it'd be usable from day 1. (As soon as I could get it uploaded, basically.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430862/#Comment_430862" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-11T16:39:54+00:00" title="April 11, 2014  4:39PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2014 4:53PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you said it yourself, the best way to be a success with these things is to start out being a success with other things.
