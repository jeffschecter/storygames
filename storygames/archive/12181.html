One of the things that I do a lot better now I think is draw dungeons. I think I've got a better handle now on what makes good dungeons, and how to draw them.<br/><br/>The thing I used to do was to think about what the dungeon was for, in the setting, and then draw how I thought it should be designed for that purpose. Because I'm kind of obsessive, I'd draw intricately designed, symmetrical and logical networks, with easy access between important locations.  And they sucked! They might have been interesting in the sense that the players could work out the function of the dungeon from its form, and that was kind of cool, but for creating a fun game, for conveying a non-linear series of choices and situations, they were crap.<br/><br/>What I realised, after touring a few real-life underground structures, is that they make no logical sense at all. They twist to fit the terrain, are buil haphazardly and to fit a budget, and grow over time. You can basically make them any shape you like, and justify it after the fact. In fact, dungeons drawn this way are often <i>more</i> evocative, <i>more</i> compelling, because the strange shapes you draw create new ideas or suggest interpretations, and because they feel like real-life places, with idiosyncracies and oddities.<br/><br/>So you can draw a dungeon any shap you like. What's a good shape then?<br/><br/>Here's some things I've noticed:<br/><br/>It's fun to come back to where you started from a different route. You take a left hand turn, and then many twists and turns and adventures later, you find yourself coming back down the right-hand tunnel. There's something fun about that. Connecting up two parts of the map and realising that you've completed a circuit is satisfying in some strange way.<br/><br/>It's fun to bypass obstacles. Finding a impassable crevasse, and having to turn back, and then later realising that your explorations have taken you to the far side of that crevasse - that's fun. It makes the players feel clever. It's even better when the obstacle is something like big forbidding doors, keeping something out, or in.<br/><br/>It's fun to feel like you haven't seen everything. There's nothing like having unfinished business. Wondering what's behind the door you didn't take. Maybe you come back for it, or maybe it's a mystery forever.<br/><br/>So with those things in mind, I invented a kind of notation system to help me draw dungeons that would deliver these things. What I realised is that the important part of the dungeon is not the superficial details like the shape of rooms and the lengths of the corridors, but rather the relationships between the rooms - the dungeon as a network of nodes. So that's how I draw it.<br/><br/>Recognising that the best dungeons are ones that loop back on themselves, my basic unit of a dungeon is four nodes, connected as a square. I draw the nodes as dots, and the connections as solid lines. Then I mark it up with embellishments. Entrances are a series of dashes outside the node. Secret or difficult connections are dotted lines. Obstacles and barriers are a line across a connection. Finally, the most important note is "target nodes". These are things like treasure rooms, places the hostages are kept, throne rooms, or entrances to the next level of the dungeon. I draw a little circle around them. Identifying target nodes helps you plan the flow of your dungeon, working out which connections should be difficult and which easy.  Here's an example:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1164498/notation.jpg"/><br/><br/>The most direct access to the target node is blocked by an obstacle. The next node has a secret access to the target node, or else they can take a more circuitous route to the target node. This little dungeon has all the qualities I listed as desirable above.<br/><br/>Once I've drawn up the dungeon structure in notation, I can go ahead and draw it up for real, adding one or a couple of rooms in place of each node, and working out the nature of the obstacles and secret passages.  Here's the final dungeon for the above example:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1164498/dungeon.jpg"/><br/><br/>There's a main entrance chamber, with the direct route to the chapel (with treasure and a statue) blocked by some locked doors. Going to the left, there's a storeroom, with a water trough. The trough is connected to the same underground spring as the font in the chapel, a possible secret passageway. A wall of the storeroom has collapsed into a natural cavern, infested with some kind of monster. If the PCs can fight their way through the monsters, they can make it to the chapel.<br/><br/>So that's how I draw dungeons. It's led to some pretty fun games. Maybe other people can share their dungeon drawing ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272950/#Comment_272950" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T06:32:06+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  6:32AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, you should walk us through a much larger dungeon design.

Your three axioms here really strike some notes with me, and I'm quite grateful of that.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and to answer your question:<br/>I've only really done dungeon drawing for 4th edition D&amp;D (well, back in the olden dayes of yore I did bad dungeons for D&amp;D3, but you know), and in that game I've only designed dungeons as places that house scenery for encounters.  I look at what interesting terrain features I plan on using for my encounters, and then sort of have loose flow-charts that hook up the lavishly planned areas are.  But now we enter a brave new era!  I am totally trying something like you have outlined for the exploration of the innards of the zombified-kraken-city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272962/#Comment_272962" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T08:48:25+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  8:48AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this tight design methodology as I tend to run dungeon-crawl one-shots.<br/><br/>The humongous dungeons I used to design in 6th grade math classes are just too big and unwieldy.

One thing you imply but don't come out and say is important, however: these are <i>narrative</i> networks as well. That is, look at the Tomb of Horrors (PDF version from Mad Irishman <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mad-irishman.net/pubs/MI_TombOfHorrorsMap.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>):<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="tomb.png" class="bbcode_img" src="http://asteroid.divnull.com/images/tomb.png"/><br/>\n<br/>\nTake a look at room 27A. The way the network of this map works, it is (almost*) guaranteed that this will be the last node reached. It's no coincidence that the demi-lich is in this room. The network is set up to continually escalate the threat as the players proceed, and make sure they can't jump to the end too soon. Even stories that don't use dungeons do this, and can be represented on a network. It's just a lot <i>easier</i> to control the network using a dungeon, which is why they persevere.<br/>\n<br/>\n*This network actually has slight flaw on this count. Party goes to node 2. Party casts enough <i>stone to mud</i> or <i>passwall</i> spells to reach 27A. Drama short circuited.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272967/#Comment_272967" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T09:28:24+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  9:28AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay.

In fact sometimes I'll make the connection between two nodes a squiggly line, indicating that there's a maze or network of twisting passageways between two areas. I don't bother drawing those, I just make that a roll for the characters to see if they can find a way through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273042/#Comment_273042" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T18:02:08+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  6:02PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got an old AD&amp;D "Dungeon Master's Design Kit" (1988), which suggests designing all scenarios in this manner. <br/><br/>A series of nodes and joining connectors.

to design my dungeons. Basically, each dungeon starts with an inspiration, and then the shape of the dungeon is determined by the inspiration. If I'm designing a classic exploratory dungeon, I try to include at least two paths through and a partial or difficult short cut, just as you describe. But sometimes I'm more motivated by an artistic goal. So I may try to fit a dungeon into a strange shape, build it around a single interesting room, or work from a concept and try to develop it naturalistically. Oddly, I'm not sure that starting from an aesthetic goal makes the dungeon any less playable, though I'm not sure how long of a game I'd want to make out of a dungeon that has just one big gimmick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298932/#Comment_298932" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-01T09:14:48+00:00" title="November  1, 2010  9:14AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That diagram of the White Plume Mountain made me think about how maps should influence game management. My first reaction to the WPM map was that it was a "bad" dungeon. Too linear. Not enough different ways to experience it. But then I thought, how would I make such a dungeon interesting? There are basically 3 or 3.5 different nights of adventuring there (one for each linear 'silo' of the map). I think to make a linear dungeon interesting, it would have to be about "penetration." (No feminist literary criticism please. I know that what I'm about to say may spawn someone to talk about dungeons as an allegory for rape or something. But let's not go there.)<br/><br/>I would really focus the group on something interesting lying buried and hidden in the bowels of the dungeon. Getting to that "room" at the end is all that matters. Each step of the way the group would face resistance in the form of barriers, traps, and tricky passages (e.g. a crumbling bridge). It would have to be an all-or-nothing adventure where turning back meant total failure, even if it were possible. At the end I would provide some means of "escape" so that the whole thing feels like a descent into the underworld. (This is a traditional literary structure used by everything from The Inferno to Journey to the Center of the Earth ... re-treading the same ground in reverse would be tedious and pointless.) Focusing on penetration would make the linear nature of it less bothersome, I think. Otherwise, a party could dip in and out of the dungeon routinely stripping it of "treasure" by solving challenges, grabbing stuff, and gaining experience. <br/><br/>In a less linear dungeon, penetration would be less important than perspective. Imagine in one scene you cross a narrow bridge over a yawning chasm with mysterious sounds filtering up from the depths. Later you come out of twisting passageways into a ravine where something interesting is going on. After a while, you realize that somewhere above you is the bridge you crossed earlier. Same place, different perspective. This could happen simply by entering a room by a different door, or by having a site evolve so that it is different the next time you pass through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298972/#Comment_298972" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-01T14:11:12+00:00" title="November  1, 2010  2:11PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple videogame level / amusement park ride design bits, from *Designing Disney*, that could probably also apply to dungeons.<br/><br/>* Establishing shots (the FEAR guy mentions something like this with his "Observability" thing) - every narrow corridor or doorway gives you an opportunity for an establishing shot, where you go from seeing nothing to BAM!

Granted, given the presence of GM fiat, all that's needed is consistency, since the GM just says what's what and there ya go, but the only reasons for knowing exact distances are a) whether your light source can illuminate it and b) what kind of penalty you're gonna take to shoot at it. <br/><br/>As far as linear/nonlinear, I designed my dungeon so that you can gain access to levels 1 and 2 simultaneously, and level 3 moments later if you're the curious type. This felt a little spoily at first, given that the alleged Big Bad is on level 1, but putting the quest objective right in the beginning ended up giving players the option of calling it a night after a couple of hours OR holding off on the boss and exploring the whole five levels first. Or, you know, killing the boss and then exploring. It's wide open.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299418/#Comment_299418" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T05:01:39+00:00" title="November  5, 2010  5:01AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Surprised no one has mentioned <a href="http://samizdat.cc/cyoa/" rel="nofollow">this in-depth analysis</a> of choose-your-own-adventure books.
