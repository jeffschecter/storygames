It almost seems like the game is aimed at a "I want to use this ability for the next scene" style of play instead of being fiction-first. <br/><br/>So I've been thinking about just merging these abilities into half their number and just dividing the build points by two. Has anyone tried this already? Am I forgetting something that may blow up in my face? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Cheers!                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455895/#Comment_455895" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-29T23:32:24+00:00" title="August 29, 2016 11:32PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think there is any mathematical reason not to, except that what you are spotting is exactly how Gumshoe is fiction-first, in its investigative incarnations.  If I'm a forensic scientist, I'm going to intentionally seek out situations where I can forensic science up some clues. It's competence porn for all the investigative skills; not making your decisions based on what you're good at is simply not engaging with the premise of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455906/#Comment_455906" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T06:15:35+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  6:15AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had this issue with the 2nd edition Esoterrorist rules where some of the skill descriptions struck us as odd in terms of what was explicitly not covered in one area. It wasn't so much "I have forensics, so I want to use it" -- that's something we're fine with. It was more like "I have this skill that you'd think would include X, but apparently not, as it says it's only under Y."<br/><br/>If you're folding things, be aware of what is going to change. I don't mean nail down exactly what each skill does; I think you want a certain amount of overlap and vagueness. But, you want to look at:<br/><br/>* Spotlight time -- the idea is that everyone should get some time to shine. Whether this means every session, every hour, every scenario, you don't want some players grabbing all the action while others wonder if they're even in the game.<br/><br/>* You're halving the number of points? How often will players need to spend for best results? That's what the points do. My concern is that if you cut 20 skills to 10, say, and I now have 11 points instead of 22, say, the number of times I may want to make a spend hasn't necessarily gone down. It's just that the number of things I can use to make a spend has been halved, which isn't really a bit deal, and I now have fewer resources, which is. I'm wondering if you might want a reduction to 2/3 instead of a half.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455916/#Comment_455916" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T14:43:10+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  2:43PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From how I understood the gumshoe games, especially from rereading Trail of Cthulhu a couple of times, you should write adventures based on their skills.

Also, some scenes felt similar in what kind of competence porn was involved, but different abilities had to apply for reasons like "I'm out of cop talk, can I use BS detector?".<br/><br/>The thing with the build points is a good point <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> maybe just doubling the ability cap and keeping the same points is the most obvious solution.

These couldbe good examples on how toslim down the skill lists.<br/><br/>In my Dreamhounds campaign I even imported some additional Abilities (Flair from Gean Reach as the ideal Dali social skill, and Network as Contacts from NBA). I now think of the skill list in Gumshoe as strong good suggestion,but if you feel adjustents for the game or the group of characters will emphasize your own style more, you shlould do it. And the system will still work.<br/><br/>When i start a Trail of Cthulhu game again the general skill list will be very slimmed down probabaly (folded in half).<br/><br/>I want to also mention that the investigative skills not only work for uncovering a ready-made plot,they also work as build points. Want some element in the game? spend from an ability agreed on by the table and its now part of the emerging story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
