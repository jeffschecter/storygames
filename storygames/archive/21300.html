So when I came across an open call for players, no experience required, for something called 'Paranoia: High Programmers', I signed up thinking "might as well." Turned out it wasn't really a regular Paranoia game. Turns out it uses mechanics and techniques - player secrets, hidden rolls, tables the length of your arm - that I'm very cautious on.<br/><br/>And turns out it was the best damned time I've had with a game in a long while.<br/><br/><br/>I've thought quite a bit of why this game works as well as it does and I would love to talk about it in near ludicrous depth, but given that I expect very few people have actually played it, I'll introduce the basics of the game first and see where we go from there.<br/><br/><br/>In HP, you play High Programmers, as they try to solve or paper over multiple urgent crises brought to them by Friend Computer, a deus in machina that keeps dropping you into trouble. Except you won't be doing that, because you get no in-game reward for actually solving any problems.<br/><br/>You do, however, get that reward in the form of sweet sweet ACCESS - which doubles as spendable supercurrency and hit points - by completing the secret directives of one of the Service Groups. Service Groups are the major movers and shakers in the Complex, and their powers and responsibilities are described by their function - R&amp;D does research, Central Processing does paperwork, IntSec snoops. In theory, they're all working together for the betterment of the complex, and it's important to maintain that image, but in reality, all of the SGs are always scrambling to shift blame or steal resources to and from another. So, the SG directives are exclusive - if the Armed Forces win, IntSec loses, and so on for every SG.<br/><br/>Every player controls at least one Service Group, and every Service group will have a couple directives to them, usually having to do with different crises of the day. This means that every player is guaranteed to have a rival, which brings in a lot of fun conflict. But it goes further than that - all of the Service Groups have fairly narrow specializations, and you will often be unable to accomplish anything without the help another Service Group. So you need allies, too! But because every single player has multiple goals in play, so you might find yourself being the ally and rival of the same player in the same session, sometimes even at the same time.<br/><br/>There are also a few additional fun wrinkles I'll only get into a little detail here - if you do not fulfil your SG's directive, you actually lose ACCESS. Because the game is zero sum and alliance-based, you will often find yourself unable to complete some of your directives. In that case, you can try to complete the requests of one the illegal secret societies. That will bulk up your reserves and add an additional element of randomness into the play for everyone at the table. I've once received accolades from Friend Computer for successfully test-firing the Mark IV Warbot bomb that I assumed was an R&amp;D fault at the time, but at the end of that session, I found out the bot had been sabotaged by two independent secret societies.<br/><br/><br/>Okay, this is not new, exactly - though it might've been when the game was first published. At its heart, this is just setting up an (organizational) relationship map and priming it for a downward spiral into bloody conflict. Brilliant, works like a charm, bit of a twist, but not unique to HP in the broad sense. Well, I agree that it's brilliant and it works like a charm, but there's two more things that make me love this game, both, as far as I know, unique to it - the simplicity of its resolution mechanic and the creative way in which the mechanic is framed in the game.<br/><br/><br/>To perform a task in the game, you need to have the appropriate skill (Sabotage), see what attribute it is associated with (Subterfuge), and roll under your character's stat on a d20 to succeed.<br/><br/>Except your character, the High Programmer you are playing, can only have the attributes, and never the skills, which means they can never actually affect the world around them, double except through...<br/><br/>Minions!<br/><br/>Every Service Group has a unique menu of minions. In the fiction, they can be anything from a single especially competent clone commando, or an entire ad agency, or a bunch of literal pencil pushers. A minion will always have a goofy name, several associated skills based on their service group, and an 'activation' cost in ACCESS for the duration of that particular session only.<br/><br/>So, remember all the difficulties we outlined earlier in terms of getting and keeping ACCESS? The only way to get directives accomplished is by doing stuff, the only way you can do stuff is through minions, the only way you can get minions is by spending ACCESS. While Friend Computer does leave a small sum to be used for the greater good by High Programmer consensus (good luck), playing the game always means making a wager against yourself - if you spend more on Minions than you get in in completed directives, you're making a net loss. Get into negative ACCESS and your High Programmer status is stripped away from you, meaning you effectively stop being a PC. This makes you want to avoid spending more than you have to - so you will inevitably find yourself trying to think of some damned way to fix a nuclear reactor leak with Subliminal Messaging.<br/><br/><br/>Finally, the way all this is framed is amazing.<br/><br/>Every time you want something done, you call one of the minions in your roster through the secure line in the situation room. I usually play this online, where the excellent Logan Senjov has created an entire system for managing these calls (aside from just generally taking the initial rules text of HP and molding it into the experience I have been gushing about today. I've also ran this face-to-face where we put an old rotary phone in the middle of the table. Unless interfered with other High Programmers, the minions always do as they are literally asked. The minions will grovel and whimper when you ask them to do something obviously suicidal, they puff up when you congratulate them, the phone lies rings with no answer when they're dead, and most of them, thanks to our excellent GM, have memorably, highly idiosyncratic voices. For example, we can never hear what our hazmat team is saying through their masks, so we'd had to develop a communication system based counting grunts.<br/><br/><br/>You feel powerful and important when talking to your minions, you feel paranoid and giddy when dealing with other players, and you feel fearful and crafty whenever Friend Computer asks you to explain your actions to it. You're confused when something unexplained happens, and hide a grin when you're the one who made it happen.<br/><br/>The emotional range I as a person travel through these games is honestly feels broader and deeper than in any other roleplaying game I played, even though there's certainly no cohesive narrative to speak of at the end of these sessions, just a jumbled mess of people messing with each others' plans. Neither is it a game about immersing yourself in a character - you might adopt a few new mannerisms or patterns of speech, but at the end, you're just being your problem-solving self in a situation where you treat your game partners as problems.<br/><br/>And that feels like a wrong thing to say, but in this game, it works completely, and I'll dig into why.<br/><br/>P.S. You should check out<a href="https://noneofthisismyfault.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"> Logan's blog</a>, and if he does open HP games again, join up! Life outside roleplaying games has taken him for now, and a big reason why I'm making this post is an attempt to help capture the magic of his games for my own.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466551/#Comment_466551" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-25T21:47:49+00:00" title="September 25, 2017  9:47PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post; this kind of game sounds quite appealing to me.<br/><br/>On the surface of it, it sounds almost exactly like Diplomacy in terms of playstyle, except with some roleplaying thrown in by having "NPCs" (the minions; are there others?).<br/><br/>Has most of your experience been playing this online or in person?

The plethora of helper tools Logan has made really helps it shine there.<br/><br/>Paul, you're mostly right about how the experience of this game goes. It's a group conversation that gets interrupted all the time by public calls to the minions, or calls from minions reporting in, with a dollop of semi-secret (you pay to have the call be secret, other people who match the price can listen in) calls to minions, and quite a bit of private messaging between the players themselves.<br/><br/>It's bit more chaotic experience than Diplomacy, and not just because Diplomacy has highly formal boardgame under all that negotiation. In Diplomacy, the turns are sharp, sudden and deadly, but in HP, it's more about managing the constant feeling of being out of the loop. More than once, you will find yourself ignoring what's happening right in front of your face simply because there are too many plates spinning.<br/><br/>At the same time, the experience you get has fairly predictable and reliable flow to it session to session, even when in-fiction events vary wildly.<br/><br/>We start the session with Friend Computer outlining the issues to tackle, and we end the session with Friend Computer tallying how the problems were solved or not, and, crucially, who is to blame if the problems weren't solved. There is an art to blame-shifting, and a lot of the game is about setting up the right scape goat and using verbal gymnastics to justify failures as successes.<br/><br/>After the initial setup, we start out by learning more about the problems at hand (personally, I like to have a monopoly on the SGs that can do Investigations easily, as I can keep the right things under wraps through mere lack of effort). People will buy their first minions, negotiate how much they can take from the common pool, and make tentative efforts to solve the crises. This is the windup phase - no one really knows each others motivations are mostly trying to set their minions up for the future or are making a genuine effort to not get shot by Friend Computer.<br/><br/>We'll start encountering our first issues there - either because conflict between different High Programmers' agendas becomes apparent, or because Friend Computer's directions are woefully out of touch with the reality on the ground. It's a high energy phase, and you'll often have long series of calls with each one an attempt to stop the preceding minion's efforts. We spend most of the game in this phase.<br/><br/>At some point, the attempts to undermine each other will reach a fever pitch, and the GM will ask for a short break as he attempts to make sense of all the secret and public orders that have come in at that point. This is the deciding point of the game, usually - winners and losers for directives will be established, and something that makes one or more of the crises permanently unsolvable will happen.<br/><br/>With most of the beef with HPs settled, the rest of the game is a wind down - we solve whatever outstanding issues with the crises that we can, and do our best to set up scape goats, explanations, or "letter and not the spirit" solutions to the unsolvable crises.<br/><br/>Then Friend Computer comes, possibly executes someone for abject failure (death isn't permanent, but it is a major ACCESS loss), we end the game and see who completes what directives.<br/><br/>And, while it's not officially part of the game, I absolutely love to stick around and talk to other players to see what their perspectives were. In some ways, it's my favorite part of the whole night, as you can stop trying to second-guess everything and relate to each other as people making sense of a weird thing they've all just been part of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466581/#Comment_466581" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-26T16:18:54+00:00" title="September 26, 2017  4:18PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds really interesting.

The best part of those is the experience of playing a traitor. HP feels like that, only everyone gets to do it.<br/><br/>High Programmers: Where everyone's the traitor!<br/><br/>Having read the rulebook, I feel most of the game is local invention, which is why I keep referring back to Logan rather than the designers of the book. Not that it's a bad book for its time (2010) - it's great for setting the tone of the game, the art is magnificent, and all the design ideas and mechanics are there. It's just that there a lot of special cases, a lot of suggestions how to play the game without clear guidelines on what you must absolutely do to play the game, a lot of it feels like cruft, and it's peppered with bits of GM fiat. Whoever runs it from the book needs to use their own judgement on what to cut and how to make things work together.<br/><br/>But the version I played absolutely works.<br/><br/>Oh, and this brings me to the point I really wanted to discuss. What I really found refreshing about the game of High Programmers is its social structure. Party-based roleplaying games where both every character and the group as a whole matter a lot are really good at creating tight-knit, highly invested groups with a strong game schedule. Also cliquishness, weird pecking orders, and an out-of-game pressure for your characters to get along in-game. A lot of Story games have gotten really good at providing you with a good experience for the one evening you play them, but often, they're honestly not that great a return on effort for the person who's running or facilitating the game (unless learning new systems is a pleasure in itself for you) - you're putting in serious work for what'll likely be one evening of play.<br/><br/>All the games of HP we played were open sessions, with at least one new player in most of them, along with a bunch of semi-regulars who were present for most games, but not all. It's really cool seeing a newcomer taking to the game like fish to water and undoing all your plans while you're simultaneously trading quips with the frenemy you have six sessions worth of history with, or having someone you helped out on a whim come to your aid when the chips are down and then betray you the very next session.<br/><br/>But the game still cares a lot about maintaining player investment. While there is loose narrative continuity (we have launched ourselves into space by accident, currently settling in on a comet), most of the sessions are fairly self-contained. The game maintains long-term investment primarily through the abstracted ACCESS mechanic and allowing the players secret projects. You naturally progress from having just enough scrape by and nearly getting erased or demoted, to having enough to be able to survive a few deaths, to spending mental effort and resources on your vanity project alongside dealing with the issue of the day.<br/><br/>The game helps create a social setting that is continuous without being oppressing and open without being fleeting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
