Ran a great Werewolf game during the lunch period, and all we bothered reading was how to make a character and how to fight things, and everything else was improvised.<br>Nowadays, I try to avoid games where my mind automatically says "this really needs a set of house rules," mainly because if I try playing it, inevitably I'll try to write a completely new version of the game (I have, at various points in my life, completely rewritten Silver Age Sentinels, RIFTS, Star Wars, Hong Kong Action Theater, etc.) It drives my friends nuts (except for those few times where it works).<br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DeBracy</cite>The old Mutant Chronicles rpg (I don't know if it was released anywhere else than Sweden) was awefully terribly flawed </blockquote>\nOoh, I remember this one. I had import copy I got from Britain (I think...was in English, and had better production values than most American games at the time). Yeah, rules were pretty crappy, but I LOVED the artwork.

The entire scenario was played purely free form with everything adjudicated by DM fiat.  In the end the Druid was a bazillion levels and through us in the dungeon where my friends amused themselves by torturing my character to death for kicks.

The PCs were 10cm high faeries trying to clear the humans out of a building so that they could make their home there.  Apparently every time he runs it it dissolves into chuckie-esque violence ("syringes full of drano") as the tiny, impotent fae become more and more desperate to hurt the giant implacable humans.  Another friend looked up the issue of Dragon in his collection, only to discover that the article wasn't a game at all, just a review - they had been playing a cargo cult version of the game from just the details in the review, and didn't even remember.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268038/#Comment_268038" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T07:50:52+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  7:50AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Y'know, if you put some marketing behind this theory, I think it could get a real foot-hold, maybe a logo and a flashy catch-phrase.<br/><br/><i>Playing wrongly with JD Corley!</i></blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/macro/heavyfrown.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268039/#Comment_268039" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T08:00:12+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  8:00AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before I knew there even was a hobby called RPGs I ran free form scenarios mostly based on Final Fantasy 9 including random encounters with turn based battles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268060/#Comment_268060" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T09:32:38+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  9:32AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was 1979. I was like 10 years old. I had gone to some summer program where my friends got to play in some short D&amp;D game. I heard about it second-hand and it sounded really, really cool. That was the first I ever heard of D&amp;D or role-playing.<br/><br/>I mentioned this game to a friend, and he said he had the books or something. It turned out that he had B1: In Search of the Unknown, which is a very odd module. He didn't have the rules though. He'd call me on the phone and we'd "play" through that module. Mostly stuff like: "There's a passageway here. Right or left? Right? That takes you to a room full of monsters!" No fighting or anything. It was still kinda fun.<br/><br/>One of the summer program counselors was a good friend of the family. She bought me the D&amp;D Basic Set for my birthday. We opened it and tried to play it, right then and there, no prep. I think we expected it to be playable with the ease of a board game and in as much time. We managed to create some characters and then we called it quits. My dad somehow had been selected as the DM, but he had no interest in the game after that initial session. I read the rules and tried to understand them, and eventually that counselor, her fiance, my dad, my brother, and I tried to play again (or for the first time). I was the DM. It was a disaster, but I was intrigued.<br/><br/>Eventually, my brother and I and that B1 friend figured out the rules well enough to get by. We played D&amp;D for many years.<br/><br/><br/>[At this point, I think JD can just post "..." in a thread and we'll all know what he is thinking.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268136/#Comment_268136" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T13:45:05+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  1:45PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first time I ran Lady Blackbird, I thought you only got one (1) pool die per action, rather than "as many as you like".
