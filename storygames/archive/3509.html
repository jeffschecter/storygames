But I think you and I have talked exhaustively about postmodernism in storytelling and I think we both know that I'm a little tired of the THREE ACT model. [DIE HARD IV sucked btw.] I am a huge fan (instead) of a story like camus' the plague or zola's germinal or anything by flaubert (not relevant). Stories about more than just ONE stereotypical mage/paladin/rogue/paladin that makes every character in the setting look like a chump. History was not forged by ALEXANDER. It was forged by all the men working for him and all the men that opposed him as well. And perhaps there's a way to tell all of their stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don't want to get into a debate about theory here, because plenty of people thing something like firefly is groundbreaking. But I think ENSEMBLE stories have NEVER been adequately reflected in gaming. You could never play LOST for instance with a typical gaming group, because you'd only get FOUR or FIVE perspectives on the island and GILIGAN'S ISLAND probably isn't great RPG material.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could never tell the MARVEL CIVIL WAR story in a typical RPG without ignoring 80% of the supers in there, unless you wanted to play for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there's something here worth exploring. But I'd rather not waste time if I'm the only person who would ever play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79159/#Comment_79159" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T15:49:06+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  3:49PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it sounds like you're saying that you want to create a mulitiplicity of viewpoints -- sort of a cubist RPG.<br/><br/>Have you read Cannery Row?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79163/#Comment_79163" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T16:01:57+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  4:01PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cannery Row the book? or is there an RPG called Cannery Row?<br/>\n<br/>\nand yes... if cubism could be distilled down for an RPG, that would be in intent<br/>\n<br/>\ni've done this for dnd, vampire, and my own new creation now ... and the idea works... but it might not be for everybody<br/>\n<br/>\ni'll bring my ideas to the game (not on the 4th, but the 11th, i presume) and you can tell me how lame it is then<br/>\n<br/>\n:)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/voicestovoices" title="voicestovoices"><img alt="voicestovoices" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/voicestovoices">voicestovoices</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79166/#Comment_79166" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T16:06:04+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  4:06PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like this idea (haha, maybe because I'm in the process of trying something similar).<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, of course, "more" isn't necessarily "better", but "different" quite often is, and it's a very different approach.

The number of named characters (those who could be involved in a conflict) were limited by a hard number, but exceeded the number of players about 2:1 or 3:1 depending on the complexity of the game. Further, anyone could play a character for "colour" and could invent them on the fly. it was certainly nothing like Ars Magica.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was cool, no question about it, but there were issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nLack of player motivation, like noclue said, was one. Without character ownership, there was little need to invest in making that character's motivations come true, and therefore little need to work towards conflict. This was especially true for at least half our group, who felt their fun was severely impacted because of this. I don't think that's necessarily a negative commentary - I think it's just what people are used to. If you invite a Chess player over for a game of "tactical wargaming" and proceed with hauling out your Warhammer 40k army, s/he might have some issues with that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue of player motivation could be helped by making all characters belong to the players who initially made them, and make them all part of a faction. Then make players fight for their side rather than through a character. That's not what the game I played did, but it seems to be what you're going for (competing villages, etc). However, if the player motivation is coming from rewarding the player directly rather than through the character (with faction dominance, "story points", finger waves, nachos, whatever), the game diverts from what many players know as "roleplaying". In that case, you need to clearly define your game on the first page of the rules - otherwise roleplayers will misunderstand it for a roleplaying game and might be disappointed when it doesn't play like one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think might help is include some sort of "prop" to make the game clearly something different than a PnP tabletop roleplaying game. For example, if the game involves conflict over resources, include rules for creating a communal map where the conflict takes place. This will take the game further into boardgame territory, which will separate it some from the RPG assumptions. The game we played had charts and maps that drove the conflict and paced the story. This was cool, and should have been played up more - in retrospect, I think we misunderstood them for "character sheets" and "tables".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81504/#Comment_81504" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T12:42:07+00:00" title="July 16, 2007 12:42PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with shreyas and Jonathan.

And I think as we get more different games there will be more people interested in playing them.<br/><br/>I can see that as right rocking way to play Burning Empires. Capes and Universalis is like a light version of your idea.<br/>For a game about creating ancient Greek city states or middle ages kingdoms that would rock out too.<br/><br/>To me what would make this work and keep people interested is if they are interested in the group or what the group is doing.<br/>In Burning Empires you are the factions working to control, save, or enslave the planet. Or you are interested in forming Alexander's empire.<br/><br/>Capes is similar but different in that it gives you in game resources that can be earned with any character you play and then spent with any character you play. Also outside of these player resources character themselves do not mechanically advance making them interchangeable in the game.<br/>In Universalis the default form of the game is no one has a set character but everyone shares a group of them.<br/><br/><br/>Having a figur head character with additional abilities that can pass those abilities on in some fashion would help alleviate the no character no interest problem while maintaining a group focus.<br/>I can just see BE limited scenes being split amongst various parts of the group.

I'm hard pressed to find a story that I found to be both "an enjoyable and/or engaging experience" and "something which I could not personally identify with in a deep way." Typically that identification works through strongly identifying with one or more characters (but usually you identify with one character per scene at least) or through anthropomorphizing some other element of the fiction so it functions like a character. I don't think this is at odds with freeform gaming as long as there is something for a player to identify with in the experience. I don't find it particularly sad. I think this may be just the way fiction works.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite><br/>But WHAT ITS DOING seems to be the same thing every decade.

There seems to be stuff in there about power gaming and twinkism that, while I am sure happens, seems tangential to this discussion and completely at odds with the responses your getting. <br/><br/>I don't see anyone saying "How many XP?" or "Where's my +5 holy avenger" in this thread. Instead, the discussion seems to be focussed on player involvement in the story and in the characters and their narrative. I see give me engaging characters in interesting situations and let me care about them and I will dig your game. That's different from I want a cookie or I'm taking my toys and going home.<br/><br/>The game idea may have tons of merit and it may be fantastic to play, but I don't think it can get there simply because its about many rather than one character per player. That's only a technique or a mechanic for getting at what the game is really about. What's the game really about? Sell me that, and I'm sold.<br/><br/>The chess example above is an apt one. Chess is about one player playing many characters, but each character is wooden (pun intended) and their choices are rigidly determined. Chess is not about story. Its about tactics and strategy. If your game is about story, the collective story of this group of characters, then I want to care about them and to care about what happens to them. The game has to encourage that level emotional involvement from me. The alternative is that I don't care about them, and then I might as well play chess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81684/#Comment_81684" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T09:36:05+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  9:36AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2007 9:36AM by jim pinto.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i realize it's a little tangential, but it's only relevant to the extent that a game the emulates group/troupe play is at odd with egocentric play because egocentric play is 99.9% of gaming out there and the mere idea of something else being brought into discussion won't work because it's not THIS.<br/>\n<br/>\ni'm not sure a troupe play game does need to do what you're saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nby definition, it's already different. it's already about THE VILLAGE.<br/>\n<br/>\nif you really wanted to roleplay chess, you could... you could give personalities to each pawn and rook. you could set goals before the game that the king has to be checkmated in a certain square and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nyou can add<br/>\n<br/>\npeople just don't want to. because PLAYERS (as opposed to GMs) have been trained for 20+ years to not doing any work. to just show up and be entertained. and group/troupe play (and a lot of the free form stuff) requires people to show up and actually play actively rather than passively react to the plot<br/>\n<br/>\nand if my idea isn't going to work that is the reason why                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81689/#Comment_81689" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T09:50:03+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  9:50AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2007 9:51AM by lachek.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really not trying to be confrontational, but that is a rather convenient "out":<br/>\n<br/>\n"if my idea isn't going to work [bad, lazy players are] the reason why"<br/>\n<br/>\nI love your idea, but as I mentioned above, I have also had a not-so-great experience with multi-character play. It had nothing to do with "just wanting to show up and be entertained", it had to do with the game writer not clearly hammering into my head what the objective of the game was, how to get to the fun bits, and how to recognize you were having fun when you got there. As noclue states, identification with a fictional character is a big part of traditional roleplaying. When the fictional character makes a great achievement despite external obstacles, we feel some of that excitement. In an appropriate setting and mindset, we will even derive some excitement from the emotional lows our character may face when they suffer a setback. If we do not identify with the character, these highs and lows are much harder to achieve. If your game does not emphasize character identification because it tells the story of a much larger group of people, you need to compensate for this. The players that find your idea worthwhile - and I believe there are lots - will happily compensate for it as well, if you tell them how.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a professional game designer I don't need to tell you this, but writing rules is the easy part. Writing rules that are fun to play with is hard. Writing rules that automatically generate a certain kind of fun, when your players expect a different kind of fun, is impossible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81700/#Comment_81700" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T10:11:18+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 10:11AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some questions:<br/><br/>Does each player control a single group?

It does feel like you are equating my desire for strong personal identification with the fiction to a twink's desire to hang glowing goody goombah's from his belt. I guess both are equally egotistical on some level, as they derive from the player's conscious desires, hence his ego. But, I don't believe this is the heart of the issue with your proposal. It reads like you came here expecting everyone to shoot the idea down, but so far everyone has been at least nominally encouraging based on limited info available about the game itself. I am growing a little concerned that the game might be about convincing me and 99.9% of gamers that we are selfish, egotistical and lazy. That's not gonna be my cup of tea.\n<blockquote>i'm not sure a troupe play game does need to do what you're saying.</blockquote>\nCool. Lead me to the promised land. I've actually forgotten what it is that I am saying at this point, so I read my post again. The basic premise is "if the players do not have a PC to care deeply about, you are going to have to give them something else to identify with in order to drive the story." By that I don't mean that it is up to <em>you</em> to <em>give</em> me something to identify with. Maybe I should clarify and say "If the multiplicity of characters renders them as 2 dimensional beings which I don't feel connected to, I'm unlikely to really dig the narrative we are building unless there is something that I do care about." I was not trying to take a passive role, just speaking in a casual tone about what the game needed to be able to handle.\n<blockquote>by definition, it's already different. it's already about THE VILLAGE.</blockquote>\nCool. I'll care deeply about the village then and the problem is solved. I didn't say that I had to care about the characters I said I had to care about something. I think a village in this context is likely the "Character" of the story in any event.\n<blockquote> if you really wanted to roleplay chess, you could... you could give personalities to each pawn and rook. you could set goals before the game that the king has to be checkmated in a certain square and so on.</blockquote>\nInteresting notion. Mating in a certain square is just more tactical complication and I find chess challenging enough as is. However, giving personalities to the pieces might be interesting--if its more than just speaking in a funny accent as I move my rook to king's pawn 4. What if the pieces get to make real choices with consequences? One of my pawns could convert to the other side, or my bishop could give up his frock and become a knight? Maybe one of my knights is a coward and won't advance on the enemy infantry? Can my queen poison her husband in his bed? Of course, we're not really playing chess anymore.\n<blockquote>people just don't want to. because PLAYERS (as opposed to GMs) have been trained for 20+ years to not doing any work. to just show up and be entertained. </blockquote>\nPeople react passively to all kinds of entertainment. It really isn't limited to gaming. I guess it depends on what level of success you would settle for. I don't see Polaris as passive entertainment, but its done pretty good. Don't Rest Your Head comes to mind as a game that demands the player to actively create as well. I can tell you feel passionately about your position. But, I don't see the gaming hobby as broken, nor do I think it needs to be in order to justify a game that goes against the current.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82058/#Comment_82058" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T13:12:56+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  1:12PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hey noclue,<br/>\n<br/>\ni love this discussion and i appreciate that it hasn't resorted to name calling, yet.<br/>\n<br/>\ni am probably projecting into your points more than you are making them.<br/>\n<br/>\ni'll try and post something more poignant later                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82084/#Comment_82084" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T14:41:20+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  2:41PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Matt Machell is working on a game where you played people from parts of a city, and the mention of playing a group of characters rang a bell with that.

I appreciate that this is something you feel strongly about and if my post is comming off angry, then I need to modulate my tone. I don't agree with everything you have posted, but I'm not at all upset. <br/><br/>To be concise - I don't believe fiction is broken or all of gaming is in a state of disrepair. I don't feel the need to be rescued from stories with strong protagonists, but I would welcome a game based on troupe play provided the game enhances my experience (however we define that), rather than hinders it.<br/><br/>I sense a certain level of dissapointment with the state of gaming, which I do not share. Your individual complaints are valid. The gripes you list do occur among the community of gamers. But, the fact that some people find fun doing things you and I don't appreciate or value, is not surprising to me or evidence of social decay. They've always been there. Will your game sell 1000s of copies? I got no clue. Is it because there are some power gamers or gognards or twinks out there? No. <br/><br/>Again, I do not intend anything I say to cause offense.

Just without any framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce done, this TOOL of a game can be used in conjunction with anything... VAMPIRE, HERO, STARGATE, maybe even DOGS or BURNING WHEEL... although that last one would probably cause people to explode... imagine creating 50 characters for BW.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now I'm losing my point and this thread as become thick with my opinions and has nothing to do with the original post any longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in the process of writing and laying out three books before GENCON.

In some campaigns it's easy to play 2 characters simultaneously, or have a pool of characters to pick from, and depending on what the mission is choose one of them to use, or have split groups of characters taking place in the game on separate fronts at the same time, with the focus going back and forth as the GM or the story permits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what is being touched upon here though is - how do you play lots of characters at the same time, or let yourself go from one character to the next in a quick fashion, without any real regard for what the next character is. This has been touched upon by us in two different types of campaigns, Cthulhu, and Zombies. In a Zombie campaign, just as with Call of Cthulhu, death comes easily should the campaign be pushed in that direction. Unlike Cthulhu, where it is a slow buildup of mystery and suspense with a gripping climactic conclusion, Zombie oriented campaigns typically involve a lot of death, and a lot of people. What we've done is created a character template that is nameless, and backgroundless, but contains various skill sets and stats dependant on whatever system you're using to play the game. Then, at the beginning, the GM assigns each template a name and history within the town. The PC's play their character until it dies, whereby the template is reset to full health, and a new name / history is given and immediately incorporated into the system. If your cop just got his head torn off by a zombie in a field, your template instantly becomes the horrified neighbor watching the bizarre scene from the window. A campaign set up like this tends to remind players that their characters are mortal, and that they have to take every precaution they can if they want their template to begin to get more powerful and not be reset - but also reminds them that it is not about their own character's journey, but is about the bigger picture and the grander scheme of things. It might take 40 villagers between your party, but dammit that zombie infestation is going to be taken out. The same thing can hold true in a war campaign, such as, say, storming the beach at normandy. When one template quickly and instantly dies trying to climb the hill to the pillbox, the template just switches over to the next closest character. It's interesting, and it certainly works, but for very heavily character driven non combat oriented storylines it's useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, if none of you have tried something like this before, it's worth it to give it a whirl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare" title="devilmaycare"><img alt="devilmaycare" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare">devilmaycare</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85586/#Comment_85586" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-04T22:37:58+00:00" title="August  4, 2007 10:37PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that it will help if/once you focus the mechanics with a setting. Just giving rules for playing a group/troupe/community may not make the possibilities click for many people as much as creating a definite setting like battling mob families, noble houses, or tribes. One thing I really enjoy about indie games is how many of them are content to do one thing and do it well. So, I would find it really nifty to have a game that helps me play a mafia family trying to take over a city, with appopriate detail and color. I think it's more likely to grab casual readers than a fascinating mechanic for a new style of play (which is what I look for, but I'm weird). Clever players will quickly adapt the rules to their own worlds, but it does help to give people the initial push. Yes, people like to identify with characters, but historically, they seem to like identifying with groups (religious, political, social) even more. I think with the proper pitch, it will sell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
