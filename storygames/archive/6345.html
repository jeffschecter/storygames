Enlist an assistant to hand you stuff and speed things along, because you're racing against the target time listed on the procedure sheet (which may be wildly inaccurate).  Scissors = scalpel, post-its = sutures, and paper clips = clamps.  That's all you'll need.  Thanks!  Getting a read on how long these take will be really valuable to me.

Maybe I try too much to find a physical sense / meaning and/or don't have enough background. What I think I understand I should do is:<br/>1. cut the superior thyroid artery's junction with the common carotid artery.<br/>2. make two cuts in the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">common carotid artery to (functionnaly) remove a section and clamp the loose ends (blocking the artery)</span> <span style="color: #333333;"><b>edit:</b></span> it's the superior thyroid artery that must be cut and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">clamped</span> sutured (note to self: must learn to read.)<br/>3. re-attache the superior thyroid in place<br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">which makes no sense to me.

I started cutting between <i>teres minor</i> joined <i>teres major</i> (left of the sheet, middle of <i>teres major</i>) by pinching the paper to create a crease and scissoring the crease. I proceeded along <i>teres major</i> down to the tendon and then around it. I removed the tendon before setting it back in place. I then sutured it and sutured all the incisions, using 7 sutures strips. These were thin strip of post-it, all 17 mm (8/12") long and varying in width from 2 mm (1/12") to 4 mm (2/12"). I used them like adhesive tape, running the strips along the incisions and completely covering them on all their length.<br/><br/>For <b>Arterial ligature</b>, I taped the two sheets together on the four corners. The procedure took me approximately 2:30 (min:sec). I creased JM01a and cut the crease with scissors, then used the slit to create two radiating cuts which gave me a flap. It was insufficient, so I gave another cut to create a second flap. I plunged into JM01b, creased and cut the superior thyroid from the common carotid. I then two times creased and cut the superior thyroid, as if I was pruning a tree. I sutured the two cuts with smallish pieces of strips (something like 1 x 1 mm (1.5/36")) which I had to custom cut at the moment. I sutured the two arteries together again using a slightly bigger strip. Then I closed the JM01a flaps and sutured them with 22 thin strips (17mm long and 0.5-1 mm large (8/12" x 1-2/36") which I used like real suture strips : perpendicular to the cut. I had to stop and start again after the 5 firsts because I stopped holding the flaps flat on the table and they sprang back open, tearing the strips away.<br/><br/>For the two procedures, I was really careful to do very careful cuts and I did not cut anything I did not intended to. No damage done to other organs or tissues. This was difficult for JM01b (arterial ligature) because my scissors were really too big (each blade is 13 cm long, 2 mm wide on the top and 6 mm high at the smallest point before rounding to nothing (5" long, 1/12" wide at the top, 3/12" high) where I was trying to do 1mm (1.5/36") cuts in creased paper. Making the crease precisely where I wanted it was also difficult. Smaller scissors would have helped, a x-acto (and a cutting mat) would have reduced the difficulty even more and would have been really appropriated.<br/><br/>I always accessed  the lower paper sheet (JM01b) totally through the flaps in the upper sheet (JM01a), except for creasing the lower one the third (=last) time where I slided my hand from the side between the paper sheets.<br/><br/>The heads on the two pages of arterial ligature do not align properly and are not at the same scale. (And we're working on scale models here.)<br/><br/>It would be easier and more comfortable if the images were a bit larger and, above all, with more contrast, especially JM01b where it is difficult to read the labels and to know were you are operating when the first sheet throws shadows on the second. (Lighting was not perfect, but it rarely is in playing rooms, contrary to operating rooms.) Of course, you might do this (low contrast) to voluntarily augment the difficulty, but I would prefer more difficult procedures with no \u201cartificial\u201d obstacles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140761/#Comment_140761" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T04:25:27+00:00" title="April 22, 2008  4:25AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow Ajax, thanks for trying these out.
