He went to Bry to find out what happened, and she pointed out he should get a shower because he was kind of bloody. He didn't remember anything about what happened the night before, so he showered, and when he went to eat the granola Bry put out, it tasted like wet cardboard (but hey, it's granola.  It's always gross, right?)  Then they went to school, and Isaiah was a little weird with his girlfriend.  Kind of standoffish.  The girlfriend, Amanda, was a little fussy because Bry mentioned he'd been drinking the night before.<br/>\n<br/>\nBry, meanwhile, was dealing with her "stalker," a nerdy A/V kid named Steve.  He tried to park his car next to hers every day, so every day she had to find a new parking spot.  Today she parked all the way out by the football field and walked in.  When Steve saw her, he was kind of obnoxious and she blew him off (like she always does) so she could go to class.  Part of the day passed, but Isaiah and Steve were both in Bry's art class, so there was another kind of weird situation where Steve came up to talk to her, to ask her about a project.  (Bry's a painter.)  He asked her if she was doing a painting, and she said she made a video instead.  Then Isaiah came up and basically ignored Steve to ask if Bry had finished their project for history, which she did.  He still looked pretty hung over.  Steve tried to get in on the conversation, but Isaiah shut him down with a mean comment about being obsessed with Bry (giving Steve the condition: In Love with Bryony).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt lunch, Isaiah sat with his football team buddies and his girlfriend, and Bry sat with her art friends.  They were making fun of her because of Steve's crush on her, and she threw french fries at them (in that friendly passive-aggressive teenager way).  Isaiah meanwhile was still being standoffish with Amanda, and then he got up to talk to Bryony and made eyecontact with another girl, Kelly who dropped a note on his tray.  Then he had a little fight with Amanda about that, and then they went to History class to deliver their project on aqueducts (only Isaiah was late because of his fight with Amanda).  He gave a really great speech (that Bry wrote), and Mr. Grey, the history teacher started looking at Bry in a really creepy way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen some stuff happened, Bry bought beer from a shady liquor store, Isaiah almost killed a kid at football practice for no good reason, Steve came over to Bryony's house to harass her about whether she liked Isaiah, and a really weird, awesome car drove past her house and she had a strange vision and went to start painting it.  Then her mom came home and got mad because she wasn't laying down (she told her mom she had PMS to get excused from school).  Oh, and Isaiah went to see Amanda, and then told Kelly to meet him at the football field, and he kissed her and then was really mean to her.  Later that night they went to see the boy in the hospital and found out the car belonged to the owner of a strip club.  Then they got to the hospital, and Isaiah ate the boy and his dad and Bryony faked more PMS to keep the nurses from watching the security camera feed.  They shot her full of morphine for the pain, so when Isaiah drove her home, she was trying to comfort him while he was having a breakdown.  (Isaiah also hypnotized the security guard to give him the tapes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat night Isaiah couldn't sleep, so he just laid in bed all day staring at the ceiling.  The next day at school there was a vigil thing for Mike (the dead kid).  Everyone was talking about how his surgery got botched and he died.  Bryony turned in her painting, which she added to after Isaiah dropped her off at home, and she got a really good grade on it but the teacher said it was disturbing.  In history class, Mr Grey was really creepy, and basically spent the whole class talking only to Bryony, who was trying to hide behind her book and pull her sweater around her.  After school Isaiah went to Bryony's house, and she told him all about how he ate the people, and then he remembered doing it.  He also had a feeling he needed to go to the church.  After dinner with Bryony's parents, they went out and first they went to the strip club, where they tried to meet the owner, but he left when they got there.  Then they went to the church and Isaiah found out he was a vampire and there were a bunch of other vampires in town who met at the church.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsaiah was trying to get them to let Bry into the meeting too, and they wouldn't, but then Bry said "I'm like his Renfield," and they let her in after making her agree to someday let someone into a building (and she made them *promise* not to follow her or try to kill her or anything).  Isaiah and the pastor (who is also a vampire) had a talk about being a vampire, and Isaiah found out that there was magical vampire tea he could drink so he wouldn't feel awful during the day, but he didn't want to talk to the pastor or anything so they left.  And that was where the game ended.<br/>\n<br/>\n**<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.  First off, I should just say, I LOVE MH.  We talked about a bunch of stuff we kind of want to explore in the game, and I think it's already going really well.  One of the themes for Bryony (being a fae) is that she doesn't actually know why people get attracted to her, they just do, and it's always a little weird (like Mr. Grey).  Both Bryony and Isaiah started out not knowing about their "monsterselves" so finding out more about that is going to be interesting!  I think the game flowed really well, and we have a lot of good stuff on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a lot of social stuff we want to bring to the forefront (status issues, vampirism as religion, how vampires and alzheimer's patients are alike, what happens when you find out you really WERE switched at birth, why high schoolers take dumb abstinence pledges...), but our MC (who has never run a game quite like this before) is handling it all very subtly, which is amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yeah.  Basically, this is the best game ever.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367153/#Comment_367153" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T10:44:48+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 10:44AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing, that was a great read.

They definitely flowed the easiest from the narrative, and at least for me, felt very in character.  I actually really like the idea of the shut-down as a social move, because sometimes you really just are socially intractable and nothing's going to change your mind.  Especially when you're 17 and moody!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a few turn-ons, too, but only in Isaiah's case were they deliberate.  One of the things I'm exploring with Bryony is "sometimes you don't know that you're turning someone on" so I made a few meta-textual calls when I thought it might be appropriate in situ...  And I'm hoping my MC will make calls for it instead, when I describe her behavior in the future.  I think the only issue with that is that I don't know it was "meant" to be used that way, so I may be playing a bit out of the design parameters with that. (That's terrifying to write.  If a mob shows up with torches, I am so not home. ;) )  The Mr. Grey thing was the big one for that meta-textual call.  (He's apparently the pervy teacher.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIsaiah's player also make a really interesting choice with regards to Vampirism too, so...during the daytime his powers don't work.  It was funny because at one point he was going to try to hypnotize someone during history class, and then he got reminded that he couldn't and was all "damn, that was a bad choice on my part."  It totally worked out, but I think we're both really grooving on the fact that there's enough definition in the playbooks that the ideas are concrete, while still giving us ways to expand on the myth and make our game different from someone else's.  (Although thank god he didn't go through with his original threat to play a Twi-pire.  I would have cried.  And not in a happy, fun, this game is kicking my ass way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBryony's "visions" are Abyss gazing, which I've been playing as sort of an art-kid trance thing.  You know how they do, just stare off into space.  Notably, none of them were successful, so who knows if the visions were real or if they were complete and utter trash generated by her subconscious.  (Hey, maybe the abyss IS her subconscious...  Uh, anyway...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368192/#Comment_368192" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T20:01:41+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  8:01PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm totally on board with "non-deliberate turn-ons".

Describe your character\u2019s pouty lips, how the sweat rolls off their strong brow, and how they look silhouetted against the pale moon. Unlike other basic moves, this one can be triggered without a specific action being taken. If the player describes how arousing the scene is, without their PC actually doing anything other than standing around and looking sexy, the move can still be triggered.</i> (final edition PDF, pg. 20)"<br/><br/>So, yeah. Having Bryony not understand that she's super sexy is awesome, and totally in-genre. Make sure to communicate this goal to the MC and other players. If you want the MC to say, "Alright, you should probably roll to turn them on," without your character really understanding what is going on, you should make sure to ask the MC for that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: princess_r</cite>There were a quite a few shut-downs (Bryony blowing Steve off, Isaiah and Kelly, Isaiah during his fight with Amanda, Bryony failing against her mom).

It's Monsterhearts day!  We get to play tonight, so excited.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my favorite situation resulting from a "shut them down" so far was actually a failed one on Bryony's part.  She was trying to end an argument with her mom, only she didn't succeed, so her mom, who is the school librarian, was now arguing with her all overconcerned parent style in front of everyone in the library.  About whether or not it was okay to go to the strip-club.  It ended with the words "If I ever hear you've gone there again, we'll have to have a family meeting," which, of course, led to some teasing and remarks by her friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was also a pretty good one between Isaiah and Steve that led to Steve giving Isaiah the condition "Bully" and Isaiah giving Steve the condition "In love with Bryony" which made it apparent to the school that Steve had an overwhelming crush.  The "Bully" condition on Isaiah is interesting though, because it happened after he became a Vampire, and definitely reflected that change in his behaviors.  I think it's also lending to some really neat interplay between Steve and Isaiah (even though Steve was originally created to be "Bryony's" NPC) because they keep crossing paths.  Like now Steve is on a thing about how Bryony must be interested in Isaiah because she didn't stop Isaiah from being mean to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.  More AP after game tonight I'm sure!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
