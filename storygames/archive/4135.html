I've noted that many of the games on this and similar forums are focusing on what I would consider 'party games', where a group of people ge together for an evening of fun, then go back to their normal lives.<br/><br/>Personally, the one game I've actually written all the way through is designed to be played as a limited run campaign, because I feel that not enough campaigns I've played in have come to meaty conclusions. (that one game was a 24-hour effort called Going Home, and its still very much in the early stages - and has been for quite some time!).<br/><br/>Now, on the other subject, well, I'd like to think that once people have played through their story, they would like to run it for others. However I know full well that gamers tend to do a thing and consider it done with, so I don't expect much. Still, it does happen. As for the Party Games, well, depends on the group, doesn't it? I know I'll always pull up a chair to Dust Devils, and I've only ever played that as a one-shot. But a lot of people only see those sort of games as convention filler material, or else get the feeling that once they've seen the 'trick' to it, that's all there is, no more need to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92778/#Comment_92778" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T12:18:30+00:00" title="September  3, 2007 12:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Panty Explosion: Yes. I hope that player will return to the game again and again to explore the relationships and agendas of their students.<br/><br/>Classroom Deathmatch: Also yes. Classroom Deathmatch makes for a good multi-session game. I don't expect the same play group to play more then one multi-session game in a row, but I've seen several cases where one person really enjoys the game his group played, and goes off and recruits a new group to try another Classroom Deathmatch.<br/><br/>As Ben says, this all kind of hinges on the players interest in the subject matter. If your only a little interested in the themes and ideas that Panty Explosion (high school, peer pressure, relationships, rivalry, stress and supernatural phenomena) and Classroom Deathmatch (murder, betrayal, friendship, sacrifice, morality, survival) present or how the games present them then I wouldn't expect you to play them more then once.

If by "instance" you mean "one character until he or the mountain witch dies" I agree. But there's this false notion floating about that TMW is meant to be played through in one session. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd agree that PTA gets "abused" in that it often ends up just producing pilots. Then again, how like real life is that? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe real culprit, I've found, is Inspectres. It's fun as a single session, one mission game, yes. But it really shines in campaign play where the franchise rules produce long-term effects, and characteristics pile up on the characters. People are missing out if they're thinking of Inspectres soley as a one-shot game. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Life with Master... you actually have to rig the starting levels to get it to be a one-shot, or even start characters with Love. It's hard-coded, for most set-ups by the rules that are reasonable, to take three or more sessions, usually no more than 6. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes 5 games constitute a "Campaign?" Or playing more than once?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are actually several issues at hand. <br/>\n1. Is the game a "one-shot," meaning that it can be played in a session to completion? <br/>\n2. Does the game have an "endgame" to it, that drives players towards the game ending (in however many sessions that takes)? <br/>\n3. Does the game play the same way every time (few to no RPGs actually do)? <br/>\n4. Can the game support indefinite-length play? What people usually think of as a "Campaign." <br/>\n5. Is the game set up specifically to be serial or episodic? That is, does the game expect that plots will be ongoing between sessions, and resolve organically, or that there will be one plot each session that will be resolved (even if there are other ongoing sub-plots)? <br/>\n6. Are there character termination mechanics that can cut short a character's run suddenly - like character death mechanics (ones that require death as an outcome, rather than those that allow it)? Or like another game I read recently where your character could, at any time during play, be whisked off to his own personal Nirvana? <br/>\n7. Replayability - that is, you finish playing the game entirely (however that occurs for the actual play in question), and then come back to play it again later. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost games are somewhat agnostic on some of these, meaning that they don't specifically promote one or the other - even indie games are this way. For instacnce, Dust Devils makes an excellent one-shot, but there's absolutely no reason it couldn't do ongoing episodic play, or even indefinite serial play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the question that the original poster is asking about is really only about the last question, replayability. But the thread has spawned other considerations. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/michael-cloud" title="michael-cloud"><img alt="michael-cloud" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/michael-cloud">michael-cloud</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94622/#Comment_94622" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T06:20:16+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  6:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i hope that people who buy Psi Run will play out many many stories of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nChris &amp; i designed the game for accessablity  &amp; immediacy of play in mind. we sought to design a game which demanded little to no pre-game prep. further i feel that Psi Run offers the possibility of many distinct stories within the over-arching situation of the game.  we did not wish to create a one shot [disposable] game.<br/>\n<br/>\npersonally.., i won't buy a game unless i feel confident that i will actually play it quite a bit more than once. the exception to this rule is  my buying a game as a resource or as a source of inspiration. <br/>\n<br/>\nit is my wish that people would find Psi Run a game that they would wish to play, not just own.  i personally hope that  who ever buy's Psi Run will play it many many times with their friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
