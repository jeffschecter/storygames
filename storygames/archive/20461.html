Girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, wives, dependent parents, children, that sort of thing. We all, or mostly all, have them.<br/><br/>I was thinking of having each player either make up 3 or roll a d6 to see how many they had, then detail them.<br/><br/>But, I'd like a benefit to having them also. I think several horror games have given a mechanical benefit to having relationships, but none of them are games I know well. My thought, for those who know Cthulhu Dark, was perhaps letting a PC burn a relationship to offset an increase to Stress, representing them slowly getting more isolated. You though may have better ideas, and if you do I'd love to hear them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449856/#Comment_449856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-02T17:44:11+00:00" title="December  2, 2015  5:44PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could let the PCs roll an additional d6 if an action involves one of their relationships (directly, via flashback, motivation, etc) but if that d6 rolls highest, the relationship is somehow put at risk (similar to Insanity/Stress).  Once the relationship level rises to 6, then the relationship is shattered--through real or imagined slights or dangers.  Bookkeeping becomes more complex, since each relationship will have to be tracked, but I like the idea that as the relationship scores rise, we can see the relationship getting worse.  And, in order to highlight the importance of the relationships, perhaps don't use the additional dice for traits.<br/>Mel                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449857/#Comment_449857" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-02T17:46:38+00:00" title="December  2, 2015  5:46PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing that comes to mind is that each Relationship comes with some kind of interaction (like spending a romantic evening with a boyfriend or girlfriend) which allows the character to reduce their Stress level.<br/><br/>Combine that with threats to the Relationships, and you potentially have an interesting game.<br/><br/>If you wish, "burning" a Relationship could mean that spending time with them no longer reduces your Stress - the character has hardened and no longer feels a connection to them, though they may keep up the motions, if they wish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449858/#Comment_449858" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-02T18:08:24+00:00" title="December  2, 2015  6:08PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing that comes to my mind is, why on earth have the player create their own relatives when it's so much more player-activating and realistic to have the other players do it for them. Just tell them that everybody gets to spec up one NPC for each PC if they want to (including their own I guess), and if you don't get any takers, maybe your character is so boring they're doomed to loneliness <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(The received wisdom is that a player will care more about NPCs they created themselves. I think this is not true, though, and the fact that it's so widely accepted has something to do with passive-aggressiveness and GMs forcing things on players. I'll lay my bid on the Czege principle in this matter, rather.)<br/><br/>But that's not the topic, so onwards: I like the idea of burning, and as Paul clarifies, it's obviously about the character losing their attachment and not about the NPC relative literally disappearing somewhere.<br/><br/>The way I'd do it would be to have relationship scenes recover stability, while a higher stress rating enables the GM to burn relationships; allow the GM the freedom to do this stealthily (the player never thinks about it, but when they next go to call their wife, they realize that it's been three weeks since they even told her where they are; the relationship died while you weren't looking) or smack in the middle of a social scene (you're with your wife when you suddenly realize that you no longer love her). Probably wise to allow a player to contest this sort of thing by accepting even more stress (I don't think Cthulhu Dark has any lateral resources that one might draw in here), where they desire to retain the character's emotions, or maybe just roll dice for it.<br/><br/>The goal here is obviously to leave the GM enough elbow room and enough antagonistic power to make up some real psychological horror; it's just more scary when it's the GM thinking up which of your character's relationships are the most precious to you, and deciding whether to have Deep Ones eat them or if it'd be nicer for the character to simply lose connection with them. By leaving the pace and targets up to the GM, the outcome is likely better than if the player was coolly calculating whether they'd rather choose insanity or forgetting their wife.<br/><br/>As for when exactly the GM could make these emotional attacks, I suppose once each time Stress rating goes up would make some sense. Been a while since I've meditated on Cthulhu Dark, so what do I know. Also, a character should probably have the option of trying to reconnect at later date, assuming they're sane and not haunted by a were-lounge-lizard or what have you. Not that this needs to be successful, but a dash of hope makes for a better horror game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449859/#Comment_449859" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-02T18:56:42+00:00" title="December  2, 2015  6:56PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all,<br/><br/>The idea of using the relationship for an extra die is nice, but not I think where I'm already adding in three traits/skills which give an extra die. Also, for the scenario I have in mind I just don't see how the PCs could credibly call much on loved ones to help.<br/><br/>By burning a relationship I totally mean losing the connection emotionally, the relationship failing, not the person getting eaten or whatever which isn't nearly as bad oddly enough (I mean, in real life it would be much worse, but in a game not so much).<br/><br/>Tracking relationships though, that's tempting. It's potentially a lot of bookkeeping, but the idea that time spent with them might improve the relationship, neglecting them worsens it is nice. You could have it that time spent with improves the relationship if you roll over the score (so if you have relationship 2 it's nice and stable and fairly easy to improve with some quality time. If you're on a 5 the trust is largely gone and it takes more than a fancy dinner to get it back).<br/><br/>The reason I have PCs create their own relationships is twofold. Firstly, it's faster, secondly my group's not really into the whole storygame shared creation thing. Your character is your character, their relationships are yours too, subject to events in game. It's trad, but it works for me. I make no claims to any universal truth for it.<br/><br/>Eero, stealth is nice, I'd have to keep track myself of how the relationships are doing but the benefit is the payoff that you don't know what you had til it's gone (cue sad music).<br/><br/>Reconnecting later is probably outside the scope of my additional plans, but I can see it would make sense but perhaps the relationship next time would end on a 5, not a 6. You can fix it, but the cracks always show.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449861/#Comment_449861" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-02T19:50:21+00:00" title="December  2, 2015  7:50PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2015 7:50PM by Paul88.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The idea of using the relationship for an extra die is nice, but not I think where I'm already adding in three traits/skills which give an extra die. <b>Also, for the scenario I have in mind I just don't see how the PCs could credibly call much on loved ones to help</b>.</blockquote>\nHey did you miss Mel_White mention flash backs... e.g " I remember my mother hugging me"\n<blockquote>You could let the PCs roll an additional d6 if an action involves one of their relationships (directly, <b>via flashback</b>, motivation, etc)</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449872/#Comment_449872" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-03T16:56:27+00:00" title="December  3, 2015  4:56PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2015 5:02PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I generally agree with most of Eero's observations about gaming, but in this instance I have disagree:<br/><br/>* In my experience, players DO invest more strongly in NPCs they define themselves. (And I certainly do myself, simply because, I think, when I come up with an NPC concept, I've already invented/created lots of ideas about them in my mind, in the process of creation.)<br/><br/>At the very least, it's easier and quicker - fewer brain-to-brain interactions to produce the emotional connection necessary, in a sense: one player gets the idea AND forms an emotional connection to it, tells the others, and we play. The other way around requires more back-and-forth and could fail more easily, in my experience.<br/><br/>The way to make a little more twisted is to allow the player to define the Relationship (create the conceptual NPC), but then give the GM the "last word" by being able to add an unpleasant detail or otherwise transform the concept slightly.<br/><br/>For example, the player says that the PC has a young sister, Lucy, who is dependent on him to get her through school, which he is paying for. The GM adds the detail that she is a drug addict and developing schizophrenia. Or perhaps that she used to be his brother but underwent a sex change. (Adjust appropriately; sometimes very subtle changes or additions are best, but for other games such drastic changes may be just great.)<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>As for the idea of creating Relationships and making it possible to lose them, the obvious next step is:<br/><br/>* You need your Relationships to lower your Stress.<br/>* You can lose the emotional connection to your Relationships in play.<br/>* The way to fix those emotional connections is to take desperate actions, which require great Stress/Insanity (like using occult Mythos material to re-connect with your loved ones).<br/><br/>This feeds back into itself nicely and creates some nasty choices for the players, I think.<br/><br/>This way, losing Relationships and then trying to fix them just makes you more and more desperately dependent on them, while also likely to drive them away, whether you succeed or fail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
