I think a "festival" is a really neat atmosphere to design in, and you can bet we'll be talking about this process as the festival continues. I don't think there is a lot more for me to say, so, check it out!<br/><br/>-Tayler <br/><br/>Let's Playtest and Play Out Loud presents...<br/><br/>Hot Visions: Summer of Design is a game design festival beginning July 1st 2013 and culminating on September 21st 2013 with the Technicolor Dreams interactive gaming convention.<br/><br/>What you will do:<br/>During the course of this design festival you will design two kilogames: each one thousand words or less. Each of these games will be designed to particular themes, which will be announced at specified times.<br/><br/>To participate join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/567808166594493/" rel="nofollow">facebook group</a> and/or G+ community so we can all communicate real easy. All future announcements will be made in those spaces, including the announcement on July 1st. (G+ is still coming!)<br/><br/>You do not need any experience in order to participate. If you've never done anything like this before then you are extra welcome to take part.<br/><br/>About your game-to-be:<br/>Play Out Loud features non-digital story games, theater games and pervasive games. You are encouraged to design within those mediums, but you are allowed to stray should inspiration take you elsewhere. However, the non-digital element is mandatory.<br/><br/>In fact, many of these rules are guidelines for a starting point. If you are truly inspired and deviate with purpose, then go ahead! This is a festival, not a competition; there is no disqualification.<br/><br/>Games produced by this festival will be featured at Technicolor Dreams if you feel they are ready for that kind of attention. You\u2019re encouraged to bring your works in progress to Let\u2019s Playtest and Ready, Set, Game PDX events in the meanwhile if you are in need of playtesting and are unable to arrange playtesting sessions on your own.<br/><br/>Timeline:<br/>Monday July 1st: The first theme of the design festival is announced. <br/>Saturday July 20th: First playtest session. Draft of first game due.<br/>Saturday August 10th: Second playtest session, second theme announced. Begin work on your second game.<br/>Saturday September 7th: Third playtest session. Draft of second game due.<br/>Saturday and Sunday September 21st-22nd: Technicolor Dreams. Show off your work!<br/><br/>Each of these pre-scheduled sessions are for your benefit - they are not strictly necessary. You are encouraged to seek out playtesting outside of these scheduled events.<br/><br/><br/>Show us what you see in the heat July 1st! Until then, you are welcome to ask questions and start talking on facebook and G+!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417128/#Comment_417128" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T10:16:28+00:00" title="June 25, 2013 10:16AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not in Portland but still want to participate? No Sweat! Obviously you probably wouldn't be at the events (but maybe you could still show up at Technicolor Dreams?), but you can still do the process, be present in the online groups and etc., and still get your game played at Technicolor Dreams (if somebody wants to run it for you, which seems probable to me). So don't let a little thing like location stop you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
