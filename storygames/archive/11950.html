Your first level D&amp;D thief is killed by a mundane trap.  Your character for an emo one-shot dies whenever it packs the most dramatic punch.<br/><br/>2) High-investment characters don't die... at least not without severe social discomfort.  If you're in an extended campaign, and you've been playing some character for months, and some confluence of GM action and player action and luck of the dice conspires to kill the character, then things get screwy.  Maybe the GM changes the world so that didn't happen, or the player changes the character's action, or someone re-rolls the dice.  Or maybe the group refuses to do any of that, so the character dies, but now everyone conspires on resurrection, even if they generally don't like that.  Or maybe the group won't budge and the player whose character died just is sad and alone.<br/><br/>This might sound pretty obvious.  What's less obvious is how "character death isn't really an option" gets communicated.  Often, I've found the answer to be "poorly".  I've played a lot of games where a lot of players who were attached to their characters used "fear of death" as a <i>primary motive</i> for what they did with their characters!  But then whenever they got down to 2 Hit Points, the GM had the badguy run away!  It just seems like a waste of mental energy -- I find <i>some</i> death-fear to be fun, but usually I find play benefits more from extending "out there" into the setting/plot/etc. rather than covering your ass diligently.<br/><br/>So, my current thinking is that, even in immersive, character-POV, dangerous play, everyone can benefit from some pre-game agreements like "no, you will never suddenly be killed by an innocuous object".  You can still dig into the paranoia when you <i>want</i> to, but the rest of he time, you know that you don't <i>have</i> to.  Does that sound like too much self-brainwashing and mental gymnastics?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266955/#Comment_266955" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T14:24:48+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  2:24PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I first played Morrowind, I was a thief.

I didn't steal stuff just after a shop keeper had seen me come into the shop. I had a great time being this super-skillful sneak-thief.<br/><br/>Turns out, you don't have to do any of that.

It was the most traditional (in the sense of the "what traditional gaming means to me" thread) game I've been in in a loooong time. At the same time, I was introducing him to games like InSpectres and Darkpages and my games.<br/><br/>The interesting (and thread-relevant) thing: my first GURPS character was very much a new-character-to-the-party (occult FBI investigation, for this game) as vehicle for new-player-to-the-group thing. He was fun, but I didn't have a ton of traction with him, and it had come up in conversation with my buddy the GM that he felt that the game was getting away from the grittiness level he wanted because characters never died. I said "hey, I'm not super attached to this character, if you want to kill him go ahead." <br/><br/>What was cool was that we didn't explicity state how anything was going to go down - it wasn't play-before-play. We just had agreed that if my character was in a situation where he could die, I wouldn't have a problem with it happening, and the GM wouldn't hold back on his end.<br/><br/>So, in the end I actually ended up volunteering my guy as a kind of sacrifice in order to make this race of alien beings back off of another players character (who my character viewed as kind of a mother figure), and agree to leave our planet.

If you just go out senselessly, killed by a mook with a lucky roll it kind of sucks. If there's the option for that to happen, then you almost want to go only with the low investment option. I liked what DL5A had where if you got reduced to zero cards your character was incapacitated but not dead. Some enemies would choose to finish you off (say like the Drow in surface raids), others would leave you or capture you. The straight kill off option would be known in advance when you're facing certain enemies, and that would create some significance. I rather like that set up, where 0 hit points or the equivalent is incapacitated and helpless - completely susceptible to a coup de grace, but have it understood that most enemies won't coup de grace. Reign also goes with the game world excuse where if you kill someone in cold blood after they've surrendered, their ghost will haunt you. I think something like that is useful, I know after playing for a while I don't care so much if my character dies, but when I first started playing it bothered me immensely, as well as other people I played with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267074/#Comment_267074" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T07:25:49+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  7:25AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think more important than character death itself is the attached implication that "you don't get to participate anymore", even if it's just for a short while.

The part of any sensible rule zero formulation that says changes should be made to make the game more fun for the group...well, that part just sailed right over our heads, <i>because we never thought about what would be more fun</i>.<br/><br/>We made changes because we thought they would be more realistic, without thinking about whether realism was more fun.  And so we ended up thinking about encumbrance rules and the volume of a backpack and calculating the water displacement of a three-masted ship.<br/><br/>We made changes because we thought they would be more challenging, without thinking about whether succeeding at that increased challenge would be fun and worthwhile.  And so we ended up stripping out important safety nets (like <i>Raise Dead</i>) and letting our fun go SPLAT on the floor.<br/><br/>We made changes because the rules of AD&amp;D made no goddamn sense and...hang on, those are actually changes I still agree with. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><br/>My point, such as it is, is that the real problem and the real evidence of our stupidity wasn't that rule zero failed us or that some evil DM hijacked it, but rather that we -- all of us, DM and players alike -- never stepped back and took responsibility for our own fun.  We didn't evaluate our gaming experience and say "How do we make this better?" or even "How can we avoid this sucky part?", we just kept bashing away at meaningless details and hoping for the best.  And when we had a bad experience, we just chalked it up as something that happens, without wondering why it was bad or whether it was something we could have avoided.  Gross fucking stupidity, really.

My second died because one of the other characters ordered him to embrace Shub Niggurath. Both deaths were meaningful in the context of the game but neither was low investment. In a game such as Trail where people matter, it's rare that death is belittled and if anything it encourages the others to struggle that bit harder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267264/#Comment_267264" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T08:07:20+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  8:07AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>I like the idea of a Death Flag, where all sorts horrible things beyond my control can happen to my character but death isn't one of them...<i>unless I want it to be.</i>Maybe I get some kind of mechanical bonus for raising the Death Flag, or maybe it's just a way of saying, "you know, if this scene turns out the be the end of my guy's story, I'm cool with that."</blockquote>\nThe wuxia system I wrote, Rivers and Lakes, handled this by having players explicitly state at the start of a conflict what they were prepared to risk in it (modulo sensible limits given the circumstances). The more you risk, the better the dice you roll. By putting that decision in the hands of the players, you can pretty much guarantee that character death will only occur when there's dramatic potential. Of course, it helps the believability of the system that cutting down an enemy when they've surrendered is not within genre for wuxia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parke" title="Parke"><img alt="Parke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v97/mikker/Zoosmell.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parke">Parke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267368/#Comment_267368" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T18:26:35+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  6:26PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>We're playing Graham's post-apocalyptic Trail of Cthulhu campaign at the moment.

In other words, all the players know going in that their characters might die. In other games / settings I think that level of expectation can vary from player to player, and if the GM expectation (or the rules allowance for death) is different from a player's, than someone will be unhappy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267438/#Comment_267438" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T08:49:39+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  8:49AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2010 8:50AM by Daniel H..">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>We made changes because the rules of AD&amp;D made no goddamn sense and...</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>My best guess is because AD&amp;D was so unrealistic and haphazard (and certain things ended up being way too easy) that the design philosophy as well as desires of players was towards realism, directed rules and core mechanics, and difficulty (particularly when it comes to death).<br/><br/>If AD&amp;D had been less unrealistic and more cohesive, it's quite possible people wouldn't have wanted that nearly as much.</blockquote>\nGuys, I'd love to see this hypothesis explored in its own thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
