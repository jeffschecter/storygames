It all went smoothly, even in the second game, when someone else was the announcer, and I forgot to tell them to end the game if the Mafia ever reached the same number as the innocents. We had a weird ending where only one innocent person remained in a group of mafiosi. But, hey, it was fun anyway.<br/><br/>However, it got my game design mind working. Here's the challenge for you:<br/><br/>Figure out a cool way for the dead people in a game of Mafia to remain involved. <br/><br/>Normally, there's nothing to do. You sit there, and you aren't even allowed to talk.

Let's break it down:<br/>1) Can the dead wake up at night; or moreso, stay awake all night (i.e. see the Mafia and Angel)?<br/>2) Can the dead communicate in any way during the day?<br/>3) Can the dead vote on lynchings?<br/><br/>It strikes me that you can't say Yes to 2 or 3 if you say Yes to either element of 1. And if you have only 1, there's not much point--that's what you get anyway, if the dead players stick around to watch.<br/><br/>So, what do we get with 2? Well, full participation, of course, with the number of living villagers and Mafia being, basically, a score. Note also that dead Mafia could continue to play and misdirect, even as dead villagers still try to figure out the remaining Mafia. SO, the key to this latter point is NOT to reveal someone's nature after a lynching--it SHOULD be moot after a night kill, as the Mafia can't get "unanimous" vote to kill one of their own number. That said, I've heard of games where that was done to give the mafia the win (totally throw off the villagers), so you can play totally no reveal and let anyone dead be a "ghost" and participate in all daytime activities.<br/><br/>I don't think you get much with 3. A vote here or there rarely swings the decision (I've found) because, invariably, folks begin to vote unanimously as their numbers dwindle, if only to get through the damned daytime in a reasonable amount of time. So I'd say, on the surface, not to let the dead vote, either for the night kill or the day lynching.<br/><br/>So, basically, let the dead be ghosts with no votes. For added fun and thrills, don't allow them to use language--they can pantomime and grunt and laugh and groan, but not speak words.<br/><br/>I haven't given enough thought to this to decide how it would skew the Mafia:villagers numeric ratio, but I bet you'd find you added a third and fourth Mafioso at lower villager population levels, to keep the game in balance.<br/><br/>OH, shit... the Angel. OK, the Angel would probably have to stay dead, no communicating. After all, he or she might know all the mafia, having only gotten "accidentally" lynched (or self-sacrificed to reveal a couple of them). So if the Angel could still communicate in any way, they'd be able to really skew it in favor of the villagers. Then again--no reveal of role upon death means smart mafia could insist that, "no, *I* am the Angel, ignore that lying shade!" (In fact, I think that's how the self-kill happened: a Mafia was trying to convince the villagers that two of them were Mafia, in a no reveal game, and then they night-killed the fake Angel, to "prove" the Mafia was called out--of course, the two innocent villagers "protest too much" and get lynched in short order.)<br/><br/>Can you tell I love the game? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ElectricPaladin" title="ElectricPaladin"><img alt="ElectricPaladin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayStressed.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ElectricPaladin">ElectricPaladin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186342/#Comment_186342" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T13:50:11+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:50PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn.

Or not. Or distorts it for his or her own gains. Hmmm... that has legs, actually.

I wish that thread would resurrect. We were getting REALLY close to a freeform, player-agency, Fan-Mail-driving-acting system to augment normal Mafia play, and it dropped dead. Maybe I need to just write it up on my site and call it (yet another) work in progress (or free RPG, no warranty stated or implied, YMMV).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ElectricPaladin</cite>There I thought this was a challenge to create a roleplaying game that incorporated themes of the mafia and being a werewolf.</blockquote>\nIsn't that game already made? Werewolf: The Apocalypse. I mean, aren't the septs basically powerful families that control territories and spend most of their time fucking with each other or fighting off the better-connected powers (Vampires as cops, basically)? Maybe that should be a new thread, though? I'm keen on this one staying focussed on what the dead can do, as I run quite a bit of Werewolf at conventions, and new players often don't "get it" if whacked too soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186644/#Comment_186644" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T13:30:48+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  1:30PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ElectricPaladin</cite>Damn.

This design challenge is tricky enough without side chatter about <i>Werewolf: the Sopranos</i>.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H</cite>Are you open to other outcomes other than death by lynching?</blockquote>\nWhat do you mean, exactly?<br/>* Day death by some other means of dieing?<br/>* Elimination of day death, in favor of some other means of reaching the zero-sum result of a full game?<br/><br/>I mean, sure, one could do a lot of drifting of the rules, but one wouldn't be playing WW/Mafia anymore. The game is about (to quote; can't recall who) "an uninformed majority versus an informed minority," and the steady elimination of (almost always, barring tricksie werewolves) the majority and an irregular but desperate elimination of the minority. Remove day death completely, and the minority WILL win, always. Even skipping one lynching (which I've forced on a recalcitrant, argumentative town) can seriously skew the game balance. Do it, say, three or four times, and I'd put my life savings on the wolves winning any given game (all other things being equal--yes, extreme luck can happen).<br/><br/>-----<br/>One option I've wanted to try but couldn't see working well (without some other factors to balance it) is "body snatchers." Basically, no one isn't killed at night; rather, one is converted to the side of the WW/Mafia; the Moderator taps their shoulder to inform them that they are now a nightstalker, they look up to see who their new allies are, then go back to "sleep" so that all rise at the same time come "morning."<br/><br/>You still have day deaths--lynchings--and no reveal (how can you tell who's really a doppleganger, even in death?). But I think you get a vicious cycle, as more and more players coordinate to misinform the remaining villagers. But maybe the newly converted would be easier to recognize, if they were making sudden (or even subtle) shifts in their argument tacks. I haven't had a chance to playtest the idea with a large enough group (I'm SURE it would take a village of at least 15, including WW/Mafia).<br/><br/>That only eliminates half the deaths, though; the lynched are still out of play. So it's but a partial solution.<br/><br/>Body Snatchers AND Ghosts? Could be confusing as all hell, though--you'd have WW/Mafia ghosts misdirecting like mad, while the vicious cycle builds the informed minority into a majority.<br/><br/>Damn... this is a tough one.

Day trials are to "test" a subject. If they are found to be innocent, they continue to live. If they are found to be a Minority/infected/Mafia/Werewolf, they die, and another "test" may immediately be made.<br/><br/>2. During the night, the Minory/Mafia/etc choose one victim to infect/convert. <br/><br/>So, there are no nighttime deaths, and daytime deaths vary. I may try this sometime.<br/><br/>I wonder if a simpler solution that doesn't change the rules as much might be possible, though.<br/><br/>With no reveal on demise, a lot of options are possible. For instance, maybe a majority among the ghosts can change a villager's vote, or something like that. <br/><br/>However, in that case, I wonder how easy it would be, logistically. Could be a lot of people talking at once... and how to handle that physically--two circles? Ghosts standing and living people sitting, or vice versa?

Here's my suggestion:<br/><br/>The dead stay in the game and they're awake throughout the night, able to see who's Mafia and who's not. After the Mafia's turn is done, there's the Righteous Dead. These are the people killed by the Mafia. The Righteous Dead cannot speak or make noises, but they get up and move during their turn. They have access to a marker and a whiteboard, which serves as their means of communicating. Each Righteaous Dead gets to grab the marker and write a single word on the whiteboard. Then they go back to rest.<br/><br/>After this it's time for the Vengeful Dead. These are the people killed by the villagers. No matter their previous allegiances, the Vengeful Dead win if the Mafia wins. They seek revenge and want to destroy the village for murdering them. Each Vengeful Dead gets to choose between either erasing a word already written or writing in a new word.<br/><br/>After this is the daytime. The dead cannot communicate during the daytime, only listen. The villagers try to interpret the writings of the dead and then erase the board so that new writings can appear the next night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344736/#Comment_344736" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T08:05:22+00:00" title="October  3, 2011  8:05AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I designed a mafia-style game a long time ago themed on John Carpenter's The Thing.

During the days, I had all the dead people (ghosts) go into another room and gave them an easel and some markers. They could each, in turn, either write a handful of words or draw a picture on the easel. Using people's names was not allowed. Mafia ghosts got to go last, after the Villager ghosts.<br/><br/>Each morning, after a murder, the living players were presented with the easel: the latest message from the ghost world.<br/><br/>This was incredibly fun, and seriously entertaining! Everyone had an amazing time, like Mafia but up two notches in terms of the actual fun level. <br/><br/>However, it biases the game in favour of the Civilians quite a bit, so consider introducing some extra mafia if you play this variation.<br/><br/>The second variation was:<br/><br/>2. The "Alien Infestation" variant.<br/><br/>One of the villagers was an "Alien". Their goal was to take over the group. The others were trying to find them before they did.<br/><br/>Each night, the Alien "infects" another civilian, who then also becomes an Alien.<br/><br/>Each day, the civilians may "test" one subject. If that person is an Alien, they die from the procedure, and another may be tested.<br/><br/>If a regular human is tested, they survive the procedure, and the day is over.<br/><br/>This variation was also fun, but it just felt *really* different from regular Mafia. The design goal of letting everyone play through most of the game was hit full-on. But it's such a completely different game that some people didn't enjoy it as much. One big comment was that people who turned into Aliens felt sad, like they were letting down their team, rather than hankering to win, as they do when they play the Mafia in a regular game.<br/><br/>It was also too biased towards the Alien in our group (which had seven-eight people at the time). So you need either more people, or you need to allow TWO tests to take place per day.<br/><br/>Either way, the second variation was fun, but not as much of an instant hit as the "Blood on the Wall" variation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
