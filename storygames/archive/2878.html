Your second dozen will suck less. By your third dozen, you might consider asking money for it.</b><br/><br/>And if you are really good or really lucky, some of your first two dozen designs may be worth publishing - but they will still suck, especially in comparison with what you can do later. To put this in a possibly more positive sense, each time you design you will get better at it, and your designs will be better. Just because your newest design is better than all your previous ones doesn't mean that you've achieved your pinacle, it means you are going in the right direction.<br/><br/>This is why my first and most important piece of advice on how to make your game better is to design a few others first, and go back to your magnum opus later. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65310/#Comment_65310" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T11:23:07+00:00" title="April 25, 2007 11:23AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't say I disagree.

More effort on designing a game does not necessarilly make the game better. The major problem is that after a very short while, revisions to your game will be random as far as the effectiveness of the game - because even with lots of playtesting you won't know what to look at because everything is seen through the context of that one game. If you spread your development and playtesting across multiple games you begin to see the bigger picture. Which lets you make better decisions in your design.<br/><br/>To put it another way, one of the most important rules of design is to have reasons behind your design decisions. This means, being able to ask what about your design goals for this game compel you to make these decisions (whether it's mechanical, setting, or even social context). With only a handful of games the main reason to make the decision is "because that's what RPGs do." But when you've encountered that decision before and taken other paths, you become better able to make those judgements. <br/><br/>Game design is a skill. There is a limit to how good you can become at that skill by working on just one or two instances. You need to diversify and experiment. Certainly reading diverse games and listening to diverse game designers can help. But there is quite a bit that isn't immediately obvious in a particular design or that can't easily be related. And ultimately you can't know if you've understood the concepts until you've tried to use them, and that requires test designs. <br/><br/>On another note, there are always outliers. Those we often see published. But here's the thought, if someone's 8th game is that good, there is a decent chance that by the time game 28 comes around it will be truly worthy of the term "awesome". <br/><br/><br/>Ryan, I mean playably (although perhaps not well) completed whole designs. Not individual design decisions or components. One of the really important things is to work with differing design goals. <br/><br/>    - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65450/#Comment_65450" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T07:48:03+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  7:48AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, I'm not really including myself in this rule. For one, I've developed a separate skill at high speed game design. And two, I'm fairly sure I'm nearly on my fifth dozen. So, in other words, given my design pace, I've scaled it down to the dozens rule. <br/><br/><br/>Tony, as I said above, the key is different design goals. If you changed design goals and completed it, then it would be a new game, even if you called it the same thing. Likewise, renaming the design you've been fidgeting with for years doesn't make it new unless you've changes the goals significantly too. <br/><br/><br/>I know this rule sounds off-putting, but it's ultimately positive. Most of the published games these days are late first dozen to early second dozen. Imagine how much better those games could be if they were third dozen. The critical point is that they really could be that good, and we can learn how to design that well.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65467/#Comment_65467" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T09:06:55+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  9:06AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I wouldn't limit it to completely finished, unique games.

Hard work can improve your presentation of your setting or premise -- but the overall power of the setting or presence is determined by inspiration, not perspiration.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65575/#Comment_65575" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T14:51:25+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  2:51PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the major advantage that experienced developers have over new hands is that they know the mental terrain:  When they've got rules that seem 99% done, but then suddenly something comes up in playtesting and they have to break <i>the whole damn thing</i> down and rebuild it from pieces ... well, that's a catastrophe when it happens in your first game.
