Specifically, I would love to read some real game examples of illusionism, railroading and how they have affected the game. I am interested in GMing again after a long, long time and have experimented with 'being in charge' by explaining and rules-facilitating Universalis (to the best of my ability). I am, however, still interested in old fashioned GMed games and in particular analysing my first and second edition D&amp;D experiences in the light of my old age and through the lenses of the new and exciting games I have discovered since returning to RPGs.<br/><br/>I think I know what illusionism is, and I think I know what railroading is, in theory, but I wonder about *how* to avoid accidentally being an illusionist villain if I GM an old module. I have unearthed a cache of ancient Dungeon magazines I had in the loft and I have had fun reading them but sometimes have found it difficult to work out if a scenario even was just a railroading disaster waiting to happen or not. For example, I re-read 'The Castle of the Blind Sun' in which the opening has an elf lady cast a spell to entangle sleeping pcs in wild plant growth with no chance of them avoiding the scene. Is this bad? Or just co-opting the players into taking on the quest? The elf then drops a hint that the pcs should go to a wizard's tower to get help. No-one says they HAVE to go, but to get into the climactic location, the castle of the title, they need a magic music box they can get from the tower. I am still trying to work out if I could referee this scenario and allow players not just to feel they were making meaningful choices but actually be making meaningful choices.<br/><br/>This actually has been keeping me awake at night and quite possibly is the oldest chestnut which will provoke scorn and derision from the assembled throng, however, here goes anyway... The characters reach a fork in the road and could go left or right. If they go right they will meet a mysterious old man who gives them the magic key to the treasure chest. If they go left, they don't meet the mysterious old man. Oh dear, they choose to go left. But the players don't know that the old man is only to be found to the right, so... oh, they meet a mysterious old man, etc etc. if no one knows but me, is this A Bad Thing? If I am the only one who knows the 'reality' of the world-in-potential does it matter? Is illusionism just a figment of my own imagination?<br/><br/>In the case above, if I just didn't bother with the fork in the road and stepped through scenes one by one, does it matter? If I present scenes sequentially, by providing clues for the players to work their way from one scene to another in the 'correct' manner,  is this awful GMing? Have I played many games like this and not even realised, or have I even *thought* I was making choices that had an effect on the outcome of the game, when in fact they didn't?<br/><br/>What I want to do is run a game where the players DO make choices that matter. I want to present exciting situations and cool locations and interesting fantasy gubbins but to allow the players to feel that they are not participants in a kind of Truman Show, but actually thing do exist in the world and it is not all just a construct around them like Squidward's TikiTiki land. Sorry for the low rent analogy. Or is that impossible? Is it all just a cardboard construct around them?<br/><br/>Please feel free to scorn and ridicule, however, in trying to drag myself of my dysfunctional eighties gaming history I feel I need help with this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412570/#Comment_412570" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T14:02:20+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  2:02PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Get ahold of either Dungeon World or Apocalypse World.

Let them tackle them in order and see how they do. Play till the last scene ends. <br/><br/>It sounds like this is what you've been doing so far.<br/><br/>You might, however, also try:<br/><br/>b) Ask the players what sort of game they would like to tackle, then prep up a number of NPCs and grabby situations that relate to that. Let's say they want to be robin hood heroes. Open by giving them a problem: there's a peasant being harassed by the town guard. Ask them how they react, then let that happen. Then, ask yourself what each of your NPC would do about it: the Captain of the guard, the peasant's brother, the local cleric, etc. Play your NPCs strongly, but allow them to die if it comes up. Play to find out what happens.<br/><br/>There's a lot of good advice in Apocalypse World about this style of play.<br/><br/>You could also try:<br/><br/>c) Ask the players to give you in advance a strong, grabby problem they will begin with and whose consequences need to be dealt with - the moment their previous life changes irrevocably. One character might be on the run from a local lord and has just found the lord's signet ring. Another might have just killed a mugger, only to find it's a werewolf. etc. The players should also give you a number of NPCs their characters know well. Spend some time before the game linking together these problems and NPC relationships. The local lord from one might have a werewolf son, for example. Hit the players hard with urgent problems and see what they do. Eg another werewolf comes looking for the one that died. Play to find out what happens. Play until the initial situations get resolved.<br/><br/>There's a lot of good advice in sorceror about this style of play.<br/><br/>You could also look at other games, for example the mountain witch, for even more styles of player-driven play. I hope that's helpful. The methods above have always worked for me at least.<br/><br/>I should also add that the methods above work far, far better when the system in question supports them. So Apocalypse World, Sorceror and the Mountain Witch are built from the ground up to facilitate the play you want and really are worth a look.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412572/#Comment_412572" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T14:42:42+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  2:42PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2013 2:58PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What I want to do is run a game where the players DO make choices that matter. I want to present exciting situations and cool locations and interesting fantasy gubbins</blockquote>That sounds like a solid statement of intent to me!  My opinion is that there is no general, all-purpose way to achieve this.  Instead, it depends on the specifics.<br/><br/><i>In what way</i> do you want the player choices matter?<br/><br/><i>In what way</i> do you want to excite them with the GM content you provide?<br/><br/>I bet if you answer those, then we can figure out a way forward.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>1) If the player choices are more about choosing how to <i>use</i> info than choosing how to <i>find</i> info, and the GM content is exciting because it provides them <i>tools</i>, then you should have the mysterious old man simply accost them wherever they are.  In that situation, you are declining to offer them any choices related to finding the man, because those aren't the choices that are meaningful in this game.  Instead, you're efficiently giving them the materials they need (magic item) so that they can make the choices that <i>are</i> meaningful ("how best to use this item?").<br/><br/>2) On the other hand, if the key player choices are all about what leads to follow and what opportunities to pursue, and the GM content is exciting because it tempts the players in multiple directions, then you should put the mysterious old man on the left fork, and a tower with a music box on the right fork, and a sign at the fork giving the players some info about what lies down each path, and a reason why they can't simply do both.\n<blockquote>I think I know what illusionism is, and I think I know what railroading is, in theory, but I wonder about *how* to avoid accidentally being an illusionist villain if I GM an old module.</blockquote>\n<b>Railroading:</b><br/><br/>When used in a negative sense, Railroading means denying players choices they wish they had.  In Example # 1 above, handing them the man with the magic item <i>is not</i> railroading, but controlling play such that they must use the magic item in a specific way regardless of what they want <i>is</i> railroading.  In Example # 2, handing the players tools to extract the old man's items and the tower's music box <i>is not</i> railroading, but controlling play such that they arrive at a certain destination <i>is</i> railroading.<br/><br/>If that definition sounds incoherent, then here's a less-used but simpler one, "<i>Railroading</i> is when the GM advances play without player input.  <i><b>Bad</b> railroading</i> is when the players wanted to have input (often because they were led to believe they would!)."<br/><br/><b>Illusionism:</b><br/><br/>"Illusionism" simply means hiding railroading.  This makes the problem harder to see &amp; talk about, but it's a popular habit because it can mean the group gets to keep playing instead of stopping to address a problem they might not believe is fixable.<br/><br/><b>Modules:</b><br/><br/>If you want to run a railroady, illusionist module, then you'll have your work cut out for you to make it not-railroady and not-illusionist!  I wouldn't try this, but if I did, the first thing I'd do would be to tell the players, "There are moments in this scenario where fake choices are presented, but there are real choices too, and here's what the real choices will be about."  And then in play, the second the players start investing in a fake choice, I'd jump in and say, "Sorry guys, this one doesn't actually matter, just pick something so we can move along."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412582/#Comment_412582" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T16:05:03+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  4:05PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe try something completely different like Polaris or Archipelago.

Don't start doing that or you'll end up doing bigger and bigger versions of it, all the time telling yourself the old man example was fine, so so is forcing them to do so and so (GM) plot element you've decided on. If you must have them encounter him, don't set him on one path, then move him to another, just be honest with yourself with the fact you're going to drop him in their path regardless. And indeed tell the players that - sometimes you have set pieces that you drop in at occasional times. Rather like bangs.<br/><br/>Next, you need characters with life goals (build/save an orphanage, become rich, become a lord, get revenge on the man who wrecked their life, woo a lady, etc).<br/><br/>Most GM's feel they have to entertain because nothing would happen otherwise - and when it comes to PC's without life goals, they are right! PC's without life goals do nothing. Then the GM thinks that to entertain they have to make things happen - but they have this pesky PC choice that gets in the way of that (even if the PC choice is to just stand there and go nowhere). So that GM who thinks he has to entertain then resorts to railroading.<br/><br/>Ask for characters with life goals. If all the players hum and harr about making one up (you can't even get one player who's character has a life goal), the hard bit is simply declining to GM for them. Because part of play is on their shoulders (that, or just cave in and railroad their lifeless characters around).<br/><br/>Edit: Forgot to say, also you don't write plots for characters with life goals - instead it's that as GM you follow the PC, rather than the PC follows the GM's plot - you just write up set pieces that might be possible to use along the way and make up alot of other stuff to fill in. Even just incrementally advancing the PC towards their goal is entertaining to the player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412606/#Comment_412606" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T19:39:00+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  7:39PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Illusionism is "what I do in my game when I GM"<br/><br/>Railroading is "what you do in your game when you GM"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412628/#Comment_412628" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T00:19:10+00:00" title="April 25, 2013 12:19AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                              Pandelume "if I GM an old module"<br/><br/>  This is where my interest was piqued. Nothing wrong with the new systems mentioned by others but if you're already comfortable with, say, old school D&amp;D and its Hack/Slash/Loot premise, I think you could make an interesting, non-railroading adventure from most Modules without a great deal of work. The trick is relationships.<br/><br/>  Those old Modules were often just a laundry list of encounters (Gygax was notorious for this). But what is a dungeon if not a physical version of a relationship map. Take the encounters you like most and draw non-physical relationship lines between them (turn them into corridors later, if you want). <br/><br/>Here are three old school encounters:<br/>1  thaumaturge: 11 hps; spells: detect magic,charm person,lightning bolt!<br/>2  10 goblins: 3 hps each; 50 coppers and a silver pendant<br/>3  owlbear: 20 hps; no treasure<br/><br/>  Now,relationships: <br/>  The Thaumaturge re-created the "mad wizard" experiment that created the very first owlbear, but his got away from him and is nesting in another part of the dungeon.<br/>  The Goblins were hired by the thaumaturge to steal the silver pendant but they expected treachery and kept it (or they just forgot; they're GOBLINS!).<br/>  The Owlbear fears the thaumaturge because it instinctively knows it's maker can unmake it.<br/><br/>  Here's the good bit: give each player a personal goal for their character to complete.<br/>The Fighter: retrieve a (mostly) intact owlbear pelt. 300 Xp and 100 gp<br/>The Magic user: learn the somantic component to the Lightning bolt spell (the instructions in your spell book aren't clear). 300Xp and Lightning Bolt!<br/>The Cleric: the silver pendant promised to you by the local Temple was stolen by goblins! Find it. 300Xp and a magic pendant.<br/><br/>  Here's the gooder bit: each Player has to keep their character's goal a secret until it's achieved otherwise they have to share the Xp/rewards with the whole party. <br/><br/>  To the left, a corridor with magical Glyphs on the walls; to the right the unmistakable chittering of goblins. Go right? 10 goblins with nasty rusty cleavers surround an angry owlbear! Stand back and watch? Save the owlbear (pelt)? The goblins? Only the goblins know where the pendant is hidden (but maybe the thaumaturge can put his "detect magic" on a scroll). Decisions, decisions.<br/><br/>  Do the characters parlay with the Thaumaturge for info on the goblins/spell/owlbear or provoke him into casting Lightning bolt for the Magic User to see how it's done? Will the Unmaking leave the pelt intact? What if the thaumaturge wants the pendant first before he helps? Wouldn't that 30 foot pit make a great owlbear trap? Decisions, decisions. Fortunately for you, you're just the GM; you don't supply solutions - only questions.<br/><br/> These are only three basic encounters found in any old module and this isn't even the main quest! You don't have to tie a complicated knot for the player's to unravel. Just give them the rope and they'll either make a noose or a suspension bridge! Don't believe me? Here's one more encounter:<br/>  5 orcs: 6 hps each. 200 sp a magic scroll and a partial map of the dungeon.<br/><br/>  Oh, and there's 3 barrels of highly flammable oil nearby ...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412682/#Comment_412682" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T13:03:13+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  1:03PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My post on <a href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/illusionism-and-wandering-monsters/" rel="nofollow">Illusionism and Wandering Monsters</a> has a play example and comes from a specifically old-school viewpoint.

If it says there is something interesting in room 1 and something deadly in room 2, you're obliged to play out the consequences of the PCs choosing room 2.<br/>- the GM has lots of room for adding details to these hard facts; you can and should give lots of "as you approach the door of room 2, it smells like death" because you want the player's choice to be meaningful, which requires that it is at least somewhat informed<br/>- modules are often situated in a sandbox, so that if they are like "room 2 sucked, lets' clear out of here altogether" you know that further down the road is another module you placed as part of the objective reality<br/>- the GM is encouraged to add connections between elements; that road might see regular traffic between the inhabitants of the two modules, and capturing one of these guys might give info about the setup<br/>- random tools help fill in the parts of the sandbox you haven't planned for; here "a 6 means you encounter an ogre" is the objective reality and "hmm let's say this ogre is offering a reward for minotaur heads, since the players killed one" is the kind of illusionism I talk about in that post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pandelume" title="Pandelume"><img alt="Pandelume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pandelume">Pandelume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412691/#Comment_412691" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T14:06:56+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  2:06PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2013 2:14PM by Pandelume.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for all this - I think I am one step towards working out what I meant in the first place and what I was actually asking about, and that's a good thing. I have a Bad Work Day tomorrow and so I am not yet processing all the info but I will get back to this as soon as I clock off tomorrow...<br/><br/>The first thing that I clung onto reading the above was this:\n<blockquote><br/>2) On the other hand, if the key player choices are all about what leads to follow and what opportunities to pursue, and the GM content is exciting because it tempts the players in multiple directions, then you should put the mysterious old man on the left fork, and a tower with a music box on the right fork, and a sign at the fork giving the players some info about what lies down each path, and a reason why they can't simply do both.</blockquote>\nThis makes sense to me and is EXACTLY what I was fumbling about trying to express - I initially was thinking that what I WANTED was to provide this kind of dilemma or necessity for the players making choices that had repercussions - they chose one thing and that meant they couldn't choose another thing and that would make for agonising oh what do we dos and that in turn would be exciting.<br/><br/>This is what I mean by meaningful choices: somewhere in there being the idea that the players would need more information in order to evaluate the choices they were going to be presented with.<br/><br/>On reading point 1 again, yes - I want to do that too. What I understand by that point is that the LOCATION becomes irrelevant - whether it is down the right fork or the left fork is not important, just that a thing is presented to the players that they then have to decide what to do with that thing. Maybe, to put it in the context of my old school module setting, the old man provides them with the magic item, but do they use it to rid the kingdom of the magic plague or do they use it to steal money and valuables. I am thinking maybe I have to provide the players with more information than I would be accustomed to, in order to contextualise the decisions they will be asked to make?<br/><br/>I was not, in actual fact, asking about how to bend old modules to a new purpose, not really, but as this has come up, it has interested me. I suppose I was asking about a better way of presenting scenarios, in general, rather than the upbringing I have received in old 1st and 2nd edition D&amp;D. And I still do like the old school dungeon tropes. A PDF copy of Dungeon World has been purchased. I think maybe something I had in mind was that I might use the situation or setting or basic setup/problem of an old school Dungeon Magazine scenario, but just use that as a jumping-off point to create something that would better achieve what I was trying to achieve.<br/><br/>Biffboff's post is VERY interesting, and this is another aspect of what I was trying to clear up in my head - I like this description of a situation/scenario/dungeon where things are all interrelated, the motivations and wants of the characters are having a REAL effect on what they choose to do and the dungeon is there, tailored with the desires and needs of the characters interwoven into what is currently going on in there.<br/><br/>This is only scratching the surface of what has flicked through my mind on skimming the above posts. I am going to have read of the illusionism and wandering monsters post now and sleep on it. I need to come back to this and further work out what it is I actually want to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412703/#Comment_412703" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T15:14:25+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  3:14PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>  Pandelume "if I GM an old module"<br/><br/>/.../<br/><br/>...I think you could make an interesting, non-railroading adventure from most Modules without a great deal of work. The trick is relationships.</blockquote>\nGreat post. I was going to write that the problem lies in the adventures, because they got a railroading structure. What you wrote is similar to the <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2" rel="nofollow">fish tank model</a> that responds on the players' actions. I will expand on what you wrote to perhaps clarify some things.\n<blockquote> Here's the good bit: give each player a personal goal for their character to complete.<br/>The Fighter: retrieve a (mostly) intact owlbear pelt. 300 Xp and 100 gp<br/>The Magic user: learn the somantic component to the Lightning bolt spell (the instructions in your spell book aren't clear). 300Xp and Lightning Bolt!<br/>The Cleric: the silver pendant promised to you by the local Temple was stolen by goblins! Find it. 300Xp and a magic pendant.</blockquote>\nIn other words: always give the characters goals so the players have something to strive for. Otherwise, it will feel like they are herded from one place to another. You want to make the players taking initiative.\n<blockquote>Save the owlbear (pelt)? The goblins? Only the goblins know where the pendant is hidden (but maybe the thaumaturge can put his "detect magic" on a scroll). Decisions, decisions.<br/><br/>Do the characters parlay with the Thaumaturge for info on the goblins/spell/owlbear or provoke him into casting Lightning bolt for the Magic User to see how it's done? Will the Unmaking leave the pelt intact? What if the thaumaturge wants the pendant first before he helps? Wouldn't that 30 foot pit make a great owlbear trap? </blockquote>\nWhen different goals are colliding, problems occur. It doesn't have to be just the characters' goals that collide, but also the NPCs' goals. Let say that the PCs wants to capture the owlbear alive but the thaumaturge needs it to free his child's soul. When they fulfill their goal, that will create a consequence when the thaumaturge tries to retrieve the monster. If you look at the big picture, this means that the players are taking initiative by following their goals, and the adventure responds in form of consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412715/#Comment_412715" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T16:29:35+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  4:29PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The danger of latching onto the extremes of illusionism (players have no choice, but think they do) and railroading (players have no choice, and know they don't) is that you risk besmirching legitimate tools as well. It's perfectly fine for the GM to have something prepped for an indeterminate area, and then to throw it where the players go. The biggest alternative is to have every possible route mapped out--which isn't possible. Likewise, the GM is allowed to have some say over the constraints of the characters' actions. Saying "after losing the fight, you're arrested and locked in the dungeon, with your gear in another room" isn't railroading, and can be a setup to further adventures.<br/><br/>So keep that in mind. All GMing is a spectrum, and the most important rule is this: <b>be a fan of the players; let them take chances, make mistakes, and get messy</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412733/#Comment_412733" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T21:35:14+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  9:35PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2013 9:36PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I initially was thinking that what I WANTED was to provide this kind of dilemma or necessity for the players making choices that had repercussions - they chose one thing and that meant they couldn't choose another thing and that would make for agonising oh what do we dos and that in turn would be exciting.<br/><br/>This is what I mean by meaningful choices: somewhere in there being the idea that the players would need more information in order to evaluate the choices they were going to be presented with.<br/><br/>On reading point 1 again, yes - I want to do that too . . .

The promises and threats can be vague, just as long as they're concrete enough to be compared against each other.  Threats especially can be vague.  The importance of time pressure varies.  By far the most important of the three is the promise.  If you can offer the players multiple paths they genuinely do want to pursue, you're already off to a good start.<br/><br/>I'm happy to discuss this more!

My personal definition of railroading is akin to Callan's, in that I define it as a false choice, or series of false choices during play: a choice that the GM (or the game's system for GMless games) gives the players that ultimately doesn't matter. How this manifests during play can vary slightly based on the group and the system, but here are some examples I'm familiar with: <br/><br/>1. "Cut Scenes". AKA "My NPC stops you from doing that with a blast of telekinetic force. No you don't get a roll to avoid it, no you can't spend xx bennie to avoid it, no you can't suffer a consequence to avoid it....etc etc. These are situations wherein the gm or the game system forces the players and their characters onto a particular path with nothing they can do to avoid it. It's important to note that games with defined "end conditions" or stages don't fit this definition unless there's no player control over which end condition they receive, or the terms of that end condition. <br/><br/>My Life With Master, for example wouldn't fit this definition because while it has several predefined endgame conditions, which one a player's character achieves is dependent on their actions. Old school "sandbox" D&amp;D with pre-defined dungeons also doesn't fit this condition, because while the contents of the dungeon are predefined (traps, creatures, terrain), the outcome of various actions is not. <br/><br/>There's nothing stopping player characters from allying with the lizardfolk in Area B to wipe out the Drow in area C and then trading the pillage from area C to the Dwarves in area D in order to gain an amulet that will let them avoid the traps in area T as opposed to Killing the lizardfolk, the drow, and the dwarves, and stealing the amulet. Or sneaking past all of them and braving the traps without the amulet. Indeed, for sandbox game play, seeing how players interact with the predefined geegaws you've put in place is a great part of the fun. <br/><br/>2. "Choices That Do Nothing" AKA "Letting the players talk to the barkeep for 3 hours, without anything interesting coming of it." In this sort of set up, players are free to have their characters act, it's just that their choices don't have any repercussions, positive or negative unless they do the one "right thing" that moves the scenario forward. This can also come up in GMless games to, when the game system demands a specific type of action in order for the game to progress and that type of action runs counter to what the players signed up for (if they're alright with having that sort of action mandated, then it's Participationism). <br/><br/>3. "Unfairly Punitive Choices" AKA "You do what!? Okay. Rocks fall, everyone dies." This is when the GM or the system creates a punishment for actions outside the "planned" flow of play that's hugely disproportionate to events in the fiction. Like with "Cut Scenes", there's often no chance to avoid these punitive measures, or it's so difficult as to be impossible for the characters to achieve. <br/><br/>Common to all forms of railroading is an insistence that things go as "planned", and a willingness to disrupt or undermine player agency in order to see that things go as planned. The simple solution to preventing railroading is to avoid prepping events. Instead, prep brewing situations that change as the players and their characters act in response to them (AW and it's derivative games call these "Fronts"), NPCs with strong motivations and goals, and locations. <br/><br/>Another sure way to avoid railroading is, as other posters have suggested to make sure that players and their characters have strong, identifiable goals for the game and are willing to act in a dramatic manner to achieve those goals, and to give the players a hand in creating the setting and situation. This can be as simple as players bringing in Bangs and Kickers or (to use an "old school" term, Hooks) from their back story, or as complex as giving players full authorship alongside (or instead of) the GM, with many stages in between ( like players being able to establish facts about the setting by spending bennies or successful rolls).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pandelume" title="Pandelume"><img alt="Pandelume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pandelume">Pandelume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412851/#Comment_412851" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T05:45:39+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  5:45AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2013 5:46AM by Pandelume.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been thinking about this and I have a few things to add, which yet again might be just flailing around in the dark...<br/><br/>I appreciate the concrete examples, posted by johnthedm7000 \u2013 and what I think I am aiming for is a situation where I avoid laying down situations to players where their choices don\u2019t ultimately matter. I think the \u2018choices that do nothing\u2019 was also a point that I was troubling me when I was thinking about all this: it seems to me like the computer games I have played in the days of yore, when you were required to hit one little acceptable response to move forward.<br/><br/>An example from my own experience of being a referee (many years ago) is that I used to massage the story by changing dice rolls \u2013 either \u2018ow, the NPC miraculously rolls badly and misses you! Hey, if that had hit you would have died, lucky, eh?\u2019 or \u2018OK, you missed your perception roll\u2026ok, um, have you got the investigation skill? No? um\u2026ok give me a luck roll\u2026 you made it? Excellent, I can tell you the next bit of the scenario now\u2026\u2019.<br/><br/>I read Illusionism and Wandering Monsters and this made me think about things in another way. I very much like the idea of the \u2018oracular power of the dice\u2019 (can\u2019t remember where I heard that phrase being used) \u2013 but as explained in Tavis\u2019s blog post:\n<blockquote><br/>\u2018Basically, everyone at the table is working to interpret the events that are generated through play and fold       them into an integrated narrative.\u2019<br/></blockquote>\nI like this idea very much and I think it takes the whole thing away from the DM-doing-illusionism thing a bit, and I think it might include random events, or events suggested either by DM or players. I think this is a far less aggressive view of things. This post also made me want to know more about Sandboxes, as I am aware of the term but not *really* what it means.<br/><br/>One thing that did also catch my attention in this thread was the idea of an objective reality \u2013 I think that this makes sense to me in terms of running an old D&amp;D module \u2013 as everyone round the table is saying, including the DM, here is a real place we are going to explore, and it is run as it is written, even though the DM is the only one that knows what that reality actually is. The idea of augmenting the base facts with as much supplementary information as is practical sounds good to me.<br/><br/>To go back to David_Berg\u2019s comment \u2013 the idea of providing promises of what the players might face or receive is interesting. I think I would like an illustration of what this might look like in \u2018actual play\u2019 terms. An example would help me see how this works more clearly.<br/><br/>I have been attempting to remember examples of Dungeon Magazine scenarios that I thought either were, or were not, railroady in one way or another. I remember a scenario which I enjoyed reading although I have never played. The setup was a dungeon constructed by an ancient magical college or guild of some kind which was a \u2018test of champions\u2019. The players could choose the path of might, of nimbleness, or of thought (or something similar to this). Thinking about this now, might this be an example of providing players with information before they embark \u2013 they knew the kind of think that may happen if they went down one path or another? The subsequent branches of the adventure were set sequences of rooms, but that seemed like it would be interesting for players as they had kind of signed up at the beginning for whatever challenges were down the tunnel they had chosen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412861/#Comment_412861" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T09:22:10+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  9:22AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2013 9:47AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good discussion. There have been a few threads on S-G recently which went through various modules and analyzed for "railroady-ness". You might want to take a look! (You'll also notice that people don't necessary agree on those threads; everyone's personal line for "railroading" falls in different places--hence Jason's comment above that "railroading" is just a term for GMing you don't like. I don't agree with that--but he's right in that "railroading" is not something we can necessarily define meaningfully and agree upon.)<br/><br/>Here are a few "basic" principles which are helpful to a GM looking to avoid railroading habits in a game:<br/><br/>1. Are the events of the game scripted, or do we get together to play the game so we can find out what happens?<br/><br/>You need to be honest about the answer to this question, both with yourself and with the group. Even a strong expectation on the GM's part that things will end a certain way ("Of course the PCs won't die in this scene! Then they wouldn't get to see the monster I designed in the next room, would they?") can change the way you play the game, which rolls you call for, and what modifiers you assign, etc.<br/><br/>If you want things to be truly open-ended, let people know, and watch yourself for bias. (You can ask the players for help here, they're natural allies since they want their decisions to matter.)<br/><br/>If there is something which MUST happen or take place, then let everyone know (including yourself!). <br/><br/>"Hey, guys, I have a great idea for an adventure. There's going to be a creepy guy in a tavern, and you'll be playing the people who agree to investigate the mystery he's talking about. Does that sound interesting? Ok, make some characters who have a good reason to investigate this mystery--otherwise we don't have a game."<br/><br/>"Ok, we're going to play [some game] tonight. I've got special plans for a scene in the throne room. So you guys can do anything you like during the game, except for one thing: I want to make sure that all the characters end up in the throne room at the same time at some point. Does that sound good? Great, let's go."<br/><br/>"I've got a scary game to play tonight. You'll have total freedom most of the time, but there's also this cool plot which involves your characters being mind-controlled once in a while. So occasionally during the game your character will do something or make a decision against his or her will. This will allow me to tell a different kind of story; I've got some surprises in store for you. Are you cool with that, or would you rather play a different game?"<br/><br/>2. Are the choices the players are making meaningful or not?<br/><br/>Ask yourself this every step of the way. Illusionist GMs often get into a habit of offering choices which aren't really choices. (Like going left or right at a crossroads, but whichever way they go, they encounter the dragon.)<br/><br/>If you don't want to railroad, remove those choices or tell the players upfront: "It doesn't matter which you choose." This helps speed up gameplay, too. (Why bother asking them if they go left or right? Just have the dragon sitting at the crossroads if it doesn't.)<br/><br/>If you DO want the choices to be meaningful, add some kind of pressure. "Ok, you can go left or right, but there's not much time so if anything delays you, you won't get the chance to try the other road."<br/><br/>3. Dice and randomness. Are they making a meaningful difference in what's going on, or are we just rolling for show?<br/><br/>Each time the dice are rolled, ask yourself or the group: why are we rolling the dice here?<br/><br/>Usually the purpose is to control how resources are accumulated or spent (e.g. "How many hit points do you lose in this scene?") or to decide between different fictional outcomes ("Does the ogre die before he reaches the tree, or does he manage to get there and set off the explosives?").<br/><br/>Think about the range of outcomes for a die roll: if any are unacceptable, cut them out. If the ogre MUST reach the tree, the players will be frustrated if you go through a whole elaborate process of rolling dice and counting numbers when the outcome is already decided. If a character dying cannot happen in a scene, be honest with yourself about it and communicate that to the group, too.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>Every time the dice are rolled, consider the range of possible outcomes. If any are unacceptable, change the rules in some way so that those are not possible, or do not roll.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>* You're playing low-level D&amp;D, but as a group you are invested a story which relies on the characters not dying. <br/><br/>Have a chat about what conditions justify death for your group. Maybe never: "If you reach 0 hit points, your character won't die. Instead, his fate will be out of control for a while. I'll tell you where the character ends up and under what conditions, and then return control of the character to you. Maybe the character is simply captured, or her soul travels to the underworld, or maybe he comes back to life as an undead and regains free will a little later." Maybe only sometimes: "Characters die when they decide to put their lives on the line. At any time, you can say, 'I'm prepared to risk my life on this!' When you do, you temporarily gain 10 extra hit points, but from now on if you reach 0 hit points your character is dead for good."<br/><br/>* You're playing some kind of mystery, a game where the characters discovers clues and uncover a mystery. You're rolling to see if they manage to "investigate" a certain clue, and you realize that if they fail the game will grind to a stop, so you'll need to find another excuse to get them the clue.<br/><br/>This roll is very likely pointless. Just give them the clue! Not giving them the clue would be like not allowing them to meet the dragon in a "slay the dragon" game: it's a prerequisite for play to continue at all.<br/><br/>If you want a roll there, have one, but be clear on what it's about. What are the possible consequences, and how are they meaningful?<br/><br/>For example, maybe the game/group is concerned about which investigator is the smartest. In this case, you could have everyone roll, and the character with the best result is the one who figures out the clue (and associated bragging rights).<br/><br/>This kind of thing allows you to play "fudge-free": you can roll all the dice in the open and never worry about the results "ruining the game". Of course, the flipside is that you need to be honest with the players about the rolls: what are they about, and what are the possible outcomes?<br/><br/>"The ogre is forcing you towards the cliff. Do you want to keep fighting? If so, there's a real chance your character will be pushed off the cliff: if that happens, falling damage is 1d6 per 10 feet, and the cliff looks like it's maybe at least 100 feet up. As you can see, the risk of losing your character is very real here. What do you want to do?"<br/><br/>"Ok, we're going to roll your 'Investigator' skill. You're going to get the clue no matter what you roll, but if you fail I'm going to include some misleading information in what you discover as well."<br/><br/>That's a starting point, basic-principle-wise. As you can see, there is a real range of what can be fun and what is acceptable, and it really depends on the group, on your goals, and what kind of game you're playing.<br/><br/>I hate railroading as a GM. But as a player? If someone said they were going to run a game and were upfront about it being a pre-written story (i.e. "on rails") I would play and enjoy the game. (It only bothers me when someone lies to me, by pretending that things are open-ended when in fact my choices have no meaningful consequences.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412862/#Comment_412862" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T09:28:00+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  9:28AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's some more good advice about giving the PCs agency in a dungeon exploration mode: <a href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/13085/roleplaying-games/jaquaying-the-dungeon" rel="nofollow">Jaquaying the Dungeon</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412866/#Comment_412866" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T09:47:15+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  9:47AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, two more things which are really helpful:<br/><br/>1. Game design.<br/><br/>Playing with rules which work for your needs is really eye-opening, too. I like to use <a href="http://www.randomordercreations.com/rpg.html" rel="nofollow">The Pool</a> as a good free game you can quickly learn and play. You can see fairly easily that it's impossible (and frustrating) for the GM to try to run a railroad adventure using this game. The players will win rolls and narrate outcomes they care about, and throw off the GM's plans. You'll be forced into a more collaborative style of play. (It's also a very slick little game. I would even remove the "GM dice" in order to remove GM influence over the odds altogether.)<br/><br/>Lots of games are designed to give or deny a certain level of agency to the players (or the GM) at various levels. Try some and you'll see a range of possible interactions between the players in the group! Reading up on "conflict resolution" (a somewhat outdated concept at this point, but still a very useful thing to be aware of) can completely change the way you run a game if you're used to doing things like calling for rolls until you get the outcome you wanted in the first place. <br/><br/>One useful key concept is establishing what a roll is about before the dice are rolled. Make sure both outcomes are possible and both meaningful (in different ways). The most obvious example is "If you win this roll, your character gets his way. If I win, mine does."<br/><br/>In a lot of railroading/Illusionist practices, what happens is that one side of that equation is missing. Instead, what's really happening is, "If you win, your character gets his way. If I win, mine <i>doesn't</i>." So the outcome is effectively rigged.<br/><br/>It can even be fun to disclose both outcomes upfront before every roll. This is sometimes termed "setting stakes", and can be a really useful process. In the process, you may discover that what you're rolling for is not what you actually care about.<br/><br/>"Ok, let's roll to see if you win the fight or I do."<br/>"Wait! I don't care if I win or lose. I just want to look righteous in front of the Princess!"<br/>"Oh, OK. So if I win, I kick your ass and leave you humbled in front of the court. But if you win, I still kick your ass, except that you impress the Princess with your righteousness and I look like the bad guy."<br/>"Great! Let's roll."<br/><br/>We set out a few possible directions the story can go, and make sure they're all interesting to us. None are dead ends. Then we roll to pick which path to follow.<br/><br/>More recent games have gone away from this model, but it's a valid way to play and a lot of fun!<br/><br/>2. GM Prep and Tools<br/><br/>GMing is often construed as a process where one player masterminds the whole game experience, controls outcomes, setup, and all the details. This places a lot of strain on the GM, and power corrupts.<br/><br/>Try some tools which force you to follow the players' lead instead. It often makes the game more interesting and much easier to run!<br/><br/>For instance, here's one I really love (and use in every game I run whenever possible):<br/><br/>* As GM, set yourself some guidelines for what you can prep, what you can introduce to the game. Create some constraints on yourself which help you prep or play in response to the players' actions.<br/>* My favourite is to tell myself: "I will not prep anything that <i>doesn't come from the players' character sheet</i>."<br/><br/>For instance, I will try to only use NPCs, locations, items, events, etc, from the character writeups. Instead of plotting an elaborate mystery and then lead the players to it, I will use the NPCs they've created and come up with ways to use them to create conflicts (which don't have to turn out a certain way). <br/><br/>Maybe before I thought of an epic story which involves a mafia kingpin and drug trade. But the player came up with a character who works in a hospital and tells me that his lover's body has disappeared from the emergency room. Ok, now we're playing some kind mystery-kidnapping romance! Great. I'll come up with stuff which is relevant to that, instead. Now the resulting story is closer to 50/50 my stuff and his stuff. If I wonder what kinds of trouble he might be into, I'll look at his background, his skills, his other relationships, etc, and build stuff that interacts with those bits. It says in his background that he's a former swimming champion? I'll see if I can set the next scene in the middle of the Hudson River, or have a rival from his swim team reappear in his life. (But first I'll ask him: "Who were the most significant people on your swim team? Any lovers, rivals, friends? Who do you still feel most strongly about? Why?" Then I'll build on that.)<br/><br/>That's a good one, by the way:<br/><br/>Apocalypse World's (and Lady Blackbird's) "ask questions" is a great GM practice to try, too. If you're not familiar with Apocalypse World, take a look at Lady Blackbird, it's a free game and a wonderful one. (Also a very short read.)<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaser" title="kaser"><img alt="kaser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/686/nMCJHMAE3CEJS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaser">kaser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412868/#Comment_412868" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T10:05:14+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 10:05AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great posts, Paul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412878/#Comment_412878" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T12:02:34+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 12:02PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2013 12:13PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One thing that did also catch my attention in this thread was the idea of an objective reality \u2013 I think that this makes sense to me in terms of running an old D&amp;D module \u2013 as everyone round the table is saying, including the DM, here is a real place we are going to explore, and it is run as it is written, even though the DM is the only one that knows what that reality actually is. The idea of augmenting the base facts with as much supplementary information as is practical sounds good to me.</blockquote>If the players come to a moment where they're sick of having no choices, or of making choices that turn out not to matter, then the agreement to run a module as written can mean they blame the module instead of the GM.  So this does solve an interpersonal resentment problem.  But it doesn't make the game any more fun.  Same deal with an objective reality.  It can be nice, but it never <i>in itself</i> solves the problem of whether meaningful player decisions are supported.  <br/><br/>If you've found a module that you think does support such decisions as written, then go for it!  But if not, there's more work to be done than merely adopting objectivity.\n<blockquote>the idea of providing promises of what the players might face or receive is interesting. I think I would like an illustration of what this might look like in \u2018actual play\u2019 terms. An example would help me see how this works more clearly.</blockquote>Having finished your last mission, you get to the "adventurers wanted" sign in town.  The sign lists "The Curse of Brookvale" and "Assault on Ethelthorp".  You go to ask about these missions.<br/><br/><b>Worse version:</b><br/><br/>The people who posted the signs tell you about how children disappear from Brookvale and monsters keep trashing Ethelthorp.<br/><br/><b>Better version:</b><br/><br/>The people who posted the signs tell you about how children disappear from Brookvale and monsters keep trashing Ethelthorp.  The imperial army wants to know what's causing monsters to flood a certain spot (Ethelthorp), and will value such info very highly.  Brookvale is in Duyker County, and Earl Duyker is known as a good guy who actually helps peasants and adventurers.<br/><br/><b>Best version:</b><br/><br/>The people who posted the signs tell you about how children disappear from Brookvale and monsters keep trashing Ethelthorp.  The imperial army wants to know what's causing monsters to flood a certain spot (Ethelthorp), and will value such info very highly.  Only very powerful magical phenomena could be responsible, things which no one yet understands.  Brookvale is in Duyker County, and Earl Duyker is known as a good guy who actually helps peasants and adventurers.  Rumor has it that he was once an adventurer, and has much useful stuff &amp; knowledge left over from his glory days.<br/><br/><b>The point:</b><br/><br/>In the first version, the player decision is about whether they feel more obliged to save a smaller number of kids or a larger number of random people.  Maybe the players find that meaningful!  But, depending on the game and the point of play, they might not.<br/><br/>In the second version, they decide whether to pursue the goodwill of the empire or a noble.  Assuming they have some idea of what they can get out of such allegiances, this is a meaningful choice about what advantages to pursue.<br/><br/>In the third version, they also get to decide whether they want to pursue dangerous and useful knowledge which they might sell to the empire or keep for themselves, or whether they'd prefer to angle for a retired adventurer's secrets.  Most groups will find this decision fun, because it's a choice of what they want and also the likely efforts required -- diagnosing magical phenomena vs winning the trust of some cool guy.<br/><br/>If your group wants things even <i>more</i> concrete, you can always say, "The Earl is offering his deck of augury cards.  The empire is offering 20 shillings and honorary ranks in their army."<br/><br/><b>In the dungeon:</b><br/><br/>It's hard to turn the "left fork or right fork?" decision in a dungeon into this type of choice.  Sometimes signalling different threats is the best you can do.  But if you decide a given fork is really important, you can find a way to attach promises to each branch.  The left path has the burned corpse of an adventurer, his gloves covered in diamond dust.  The right path has a numbingly cold wind bringing the sound of distant chanting, and scraps of parchment with strange symbols litter the floor.<br/><br/>Hopefully this allows the players to choose something like, "Should we battle badass fire monsters for awesome treasure, or steal the magical secrets of a cult?"<br/><br/>If not, then here's a key technique: <b>add details until they get it</b>.  "And then you notice a ruby glittering behind the dead guy."  "The strange symbols are similar to the ancient script on the magic sword you saw earlier, which might have imbued it with its power."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412881/#Comment_412881" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T12:40:58+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 12:40PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on, Dave.

This thread has really helped me to organise thoughts concerning my enduring love of D&amp;D, which are, I admit, embedded in nostalgia.<br/><br/>The examples above help because they allow me to see how this might look in real prep or at the table at the beginning f a real session. I haven't considered giving the players this amount of information before, or considered how the information I give could affect the decisions made.<br/><br/>I have been thinking a lot about the possibility of setting stakes as described by Paul_T, after having read a post about this same subject on 'anyway.' some time ago. Why has game design moved away from this approach?<br/><br/>I have also been mulling over the premise of having up front the understanding that PCs wouldn't die unless they stated, as suggested above, that there was something they were prepared to risk their life over, and that failing something would introduce further complications rather than just drain hit points.\n<blockquote>Have a chat about what conditions justify death for your group. Maybe never: "If you reach 0 hit points, your character won't die. Instead, his fate will be out of control for a while. I'll tell you where the character ends up and under what conditions, and then return control of the character to you. Maybe the character is simply captured, or her soul travels to the underworld, or maybe he comes back to life as an undead and regains free will a little later." Maybe only sometimes: "Characters die when they decide to put their lives on the line. At any time, you can say, 'I'm prepared to risk my life on this!' When you do, you temporarily gain 10 extra hit points, but from now on if you reach 0 hit points your character is dead for good."</blockquote>\nThis concept puts power in the hands of the players and I think that's what I am looking for. I am interested in games, such as Universalis, where there is a currency, a resource to be managed, so that players can choose which conflicts or issues they WANT to win or enforce their version of events on.

Virtually <i>zero</i> similarity to the experience of playing a D&amp;D module, though.  If you're looking to combine features of both, several games layer metagame currency on top of old-school resolution of tasks.  Like, in the case of D&amp;D combat you could say "players earn tokens, and each token can be spent at any time for a +5 to hit or a +5 to damage".  I think Fate Points in FATE work like that, but I haven't played so I'm not positive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412908/#Comment_412908" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T16:53:37+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  4:53PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (If you're interested in fudge-free play and old-school D&amp;D, go no further than <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18249/the-osr-in-vivid-colour-an-actual-play" rel="nofollow">this thread!</a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412909/#Comment_412909" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T16:56:54+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  4:56PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for stake setting, I think it's a very powerful and effective approach.

Sometimes signalling different threats is the best you can do.  But if you decide a given fork is really important, you can find a way to attach promises to each branch.  The left path has the burned corpse of an adventurer, his gloves covered in diamond dust.  The right path has a numbingly cold wind bringing the sound of distant chanting, and scraps of parchment with strange symbols litter the floor.</blockquote>\nI've considered this - but actually I think a blind left/right choice has it's place. Once you've gone through a series of left right choices, even though it's arbitrary, basically this causes a 'were not in Kansas' effect, in that it's clear that the GM has not pre decided any encounters you'll have because you're at some really random branch of the dungeon.<br/><br/>That's assuming you don't have to do every single room in the dungeon. And it has the downside that requires the players leave a fair number of rooms unexplored when they finally finish with the dungeon. So that's alot of material skipped (and about the time you start googling random dungeon generators).<br/><br/>I think there can be merit with the blind left/right choice, when done multiple times. After a few times, it shows the players the GM just isn't in charge of their experiences any more. It's a spooky and exciting feeling.<br/><br/>Unless the GM shifts encounters around behind the scenes to ensure players run into it. Which just poisons that feeling, in the end.<br/><br/>Also, that said, I'm inclined to say this doesn't make up for characters who have no life goals (even just 'get rich/powerful' counts as a life goal (and as such it's very sad that it's been maligned by 'real roleplayers' for so long))                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412930/#Comment_412930" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T22:41:50+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 10:41PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think there can be merit with the blind left/right choice, when done multiple times.

(I have an axe to grind here, because Adventurer Conqueror King and especially <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/autarch/domains-at-war" rel="nofollow">Domains at War</a> are focused on providing this support.) <br/><br/>Talking to guys like Michael Mornard who were part of the early campaigns in Lake Geneva and the Twin Cities, it was clear that Chainmail set their expectations about the risks and rewards of becoming wealthy and powerful. Being a cleric was attractive in part because you got a discount on your stronghold and followers, and required fewer XP to get there (which also meant amassing less treasure because this was the main driver of XP). Reaching that point meant that you got to participate in the grand campaign where your actions would decide the fate of kingdoms. <br/><br/>Without support like this, having the goal of being wealthy is like saying you want to be good at talking to people in a bar (to use the example of meaningless choice above). Saying "my goal is to end slavery" clearly plugs you into a relationship with the setting; it's easy for the GM to see what challenges and role-playing opportunities are going to flow from that goal. In later editions of D&amp;D where wealth is directly applicable to tools for you to better take on the existing combat challenges, spending money on the setting is as contrarian a choice as choosing feats for flavor instead of effectiveness. <br/><br/>When you do have a system that supports large-scale enterprises like building strongholds and ruling armies, though, the GM has lots of tools for seeing what challenges "getting rich and powerful" is going to generate (both in the setting and as a game) and what relationships with NPCs are going to be unlocked by a wealthy character.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MrPurple" title="MrPurple"><img alt="MrPurple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MrPurple">MrPurple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412955/#Comment_412955" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T10:13:36+00:00" title="April 28, 2013 10:13AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The danger of latching onto the extremes of illusionism (players have no choice, but think they do) and railroading (players have no choice, and know they don't) is that you risk besmirching legitimate tools as well. It's perfectly fine for the GM to have something prepped for an indeterminate area, and then to throw it where the players go. The biggest alternative is to have every possible route mapped out--which isn't possible. Likewise, the GM is allowed to have some say over the constraints of the characters' actions. Saying "after losing the fight, you're arrested and locked in the dungeon, with your gear in another room" isn't railroading, and can be a setup to further adventures.<br/><br/>So keep that in mind.

Basically, the players are told what the PCs have to do and what the outcome has to be. This doesn't fit the world. It probably doesn't fit most of the PCs that they've been told to generate. It's completely unnecessary. And, at least once, the GM is told the PCs must accomplish something tricky enough that I'm not sure how one does it and given no guidelines on how they might do this. It isn't illusionism, though, as the players will be all too aware of how they're being railroaded.<br/><br/>An example of odd railroading is what happened in my Kerberos Fate game. The players had figured out how to break a curse, which meant, technically, there'd be no attack of monstrous Martian tree creatures. As folks were disappointed, I noted that I'd statted out the creatures, and one could handwave details and say that the tree creatures would attack in a last desperate attempt to keep the curse from being broken. That wasn't the railroading, you understand, just the catering to my players.<br/><br/>No, the railroading, as one of the players pointed out after the fact, is that this was a battle we all knew the PCs would win. Indeed, they had to win it. It wasn't an easy battle, as I'd made the tree creatures very tough, but I also chose not to spend fate points on their behalf, even though the rules of Kerberos Fate allowed me to spend up to nine, based on the number of players and the importance of the scene as a climactic battle.<br/><br/>I didn't cheat. I didn't make the creatures idiotic, and I didn't fudge die rolls, which were all made out in the open. But, yes, I did keep an eye on how the fight was going, and I didn't pile on extra difficulties.<br/><br/>Again, this was not illusionism, as we were all completely aware of what was happening. It was railroading, as, No Matter What, the PCs were fighting tree creatures, and they were going to win. But, it was railroading we all chose -- do we call that buying our train tickets in advance, I wonder?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413322/#Comment_413322" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T19:06:13+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  7:06PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Participationism.
