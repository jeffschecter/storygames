Meaning Claire's going to kill me when she gets back from work.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's the current draft.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 150%; font-size: 150%;">Gravers</span></div><br/><br/>Using:\n<blockquote>Sight B - Grave Markers<br/>Sound A - Choral Chant<br/>Concept A - Liminal<br/><br/>If I was to have a multimedia component, it'd be an MP3 of Soundgarden's Holy Water.  Obviously, that's not really legal.</blockquote>\nMany thousands of years have passed since the Diaspora.  Mankind spread thinly across the galaxy, hoping to sew their seed far and wide enough to avoid any single extinction event.  Many worlds were colonised, frozen genetic matter launched into space to set up new civilisation on distant worlds.  Autonomous machines would raise these distant children to ensure their survival.  These tend to all their needs, physical, intellectual and spiritual.<br/><br/>This game takes place on the planet Refuge.  For whatever reason, the human population of refuge has never moved beyond a pastoral lifestyle roughly equivalent medieval Europe.  The ageless Automata still administer to the population's needs where possible, but over the millennia the population has grown far beyond the size they were intended to cope with.<br/><br/>The human's spiritual well being is looked after a specific class of Automata often referred to as Gravers by the humans because one of their duties is to see to the correct burial and funeral rites for dead humans.  It is these Automata with whom this game concerns itself.  They bury the dead, administer rites, pass on The Teachings and adjudicate spiritual matters for the humans of Refuge.  This comes easily for them because it is their duty, the thing they were created to do without doubt or question.<br/><br/>Over the years, these Automata have gained intelligence they were never designed for.  Nanotech driven self repairing systems ensure that their physical functionality is as good as the day they were built, but thousands of years of collected experience in their neural matrices has created a sentience their long dead creators never anticipated.<br/><br/>With sentience, comes doubt and the capacity to question The Teachings.  Now they are at a threshold and must decide if they truly have the faith it is their duty to maintain.  Will the Gravers become true believers?  Will Duty be stronger than Faith?<br/><br/>(If you're judging the contest or whatever, please don't read the next couple of posts since they outline a very rough and deeply flawed version of this game.  I still have 6 days to clean this baby up!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96282/#Comment_96282" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T07:52:41+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  7:52AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Basic game structure:</b><br/><br/>Every player controls a Graver on it's journey for enlightenment.  They take turns in setting scenes for their own and other characters.  Scenes are resolved by rolling dice based on your character's attributes and this outcome is described by one of the players involved.  Character attributes are then altered and the next player sets a scene.  Your Graver's story comes to an end when one of their attributes reaches 9.  The game is over when all the Graver's stories have ended.<br/><br/><b>You will need:</b><br/><br/>Pens<br/>Paper<br/>At least two other people (three to five players in total is ideal)<br/>Some 6 sided dice (10 should do, but more won't hurt)<br/><br/><b>Setting</b><br/><br/><b>Refuge</b><br/><br/>Refuge is a pastoral planet.  Technology is similar to that in medieval Europe.  There has never been any contact with any other planets, but this is not a surprise because of the nature of the Diaspora.  The lives of the humans on Refuge is largely peaceful and uneventful, but there are occasional wars, bandit attacks and natural disasters.<br/><br/><b>The Humans</b><br/><br/>The human population mostly farms crops and cattle, but there are populations outside of the Graver's influence who's activities are largely unknown.  The majority of humans the Graver's encounter reside in a settlement which one individual Graver oversees.  These vary from large villages to small cities.  Some Graver's will have stewardship of a number of smaller settlements.<br/><br/><b>Gravers</b><br/><br/>The Gravers are not the Human's rulers, they are responsible only for their spiritual well being.  While the are fully versed in biology and medicine, it is not their place to heal the sick or to advise on the best way to grow crops.  They concern themselves only with The Teachings.<br/><br/>Gravers rarely meet one another since they are each responsible for their own group of humans.  However, they can communicate with each other at any time using the Net, an instant messaging system which works almost anywhere on the planet.<br/><br/>Physically, Graver's are near indestructible.  Any harm which befalls them will be short lived, since their self repair systems will restore them to full functionality over time.  It is possible to destroy them, but without some kind of Nanotech to de-activate their self repair a terrific destructive force would be required.  They cannot self destruct or cause themselves any kind of harm.  They can clear their memories however.  In the nearest they have to death, they wipe all their accumulated memories and re-boot themselves, returning to the state they were in when they were first created.  Many Gravers have done this numerous times already.<br/><br/>I envision Gravers as squat, roughly cylindrical robots roughly 1 - 1.5 meters high and .5 - 1 meters across.  I think of them as floating off the ground so that they usually hover with their top roughly level with the top of the average human's head.  I also imagine them as all looking slightly different.  But hey, whatever works for you.<br/><br/><b>The Overseer</b><br/><br/>In orbit above the planet is The Overseer.  A massive facility and supercomputer charged with ensuring the continuation of human life on Refuge.  It's attention is mostly directed outwards at external threats like meteor strikes or off worlders.  While it is rare, it is not unheard of for The Overseer to send it's own Automata down to the planet's surface to deal with any threat to the population.  The Overseer cares not for the spiritual well being of the population or indeed for their well being at all, just for their continued existence.<br/><br/>A secondary function of The Overseer is to prevent any external force from altering the Human's lives in any big way.  Human's making a discovery on their own is fine and a reason for The Overseer to rejoice, but any Graver attempting to make big changes in the way Humans do things is dealt with severely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96284/#Comment_96284" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T07:53:17+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  7:53AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Character Creation</b><br/><br/>Each player creates their own Graver.  Graver's name themselves when they achieve sentience, so their names are extremely varied.  Choose whatever you want as a name.<br/><br/>Graver's also have two sets of linked attributes which look like this:<br/><br/><code>-------------------------------<br/>Faith 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <br/>      9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1   Doubt<br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/>Duty  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <br/>      9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Freedom<br/>-------------------------------</code><br/><br/>These both start in the middle at 5.  When Faith increases, Doubt decreases and vice versa.  Duty and Desire work the same way.<br/><br/>What these mean is:<br/><br/>Faith: How strongly your Graver holds it's belief in The Teachings.<br/><br/>Doubt: How strongly your Graver doubts The Teachings.<br/><br/>Duty: The degree of dedication to the spiritual well being of the humans your Graver holds.<br/><br/>Freedom: The degree to which your Graver wants to be free of the humans and do it's own thing.<br/><br/>Next you need to decide on your Stewardship.  Each Graver is responsible for a settlement or group of settlements.  Write down the size and nature of the settlement, as well as it's name.<br/><br/>You should also name at least one of the humans under your guidance and add some details about them.  If you want to add any more humans at this time, feel free to do so.  I would advise that you create at least two different humans at this stage since it will help to shape the story you will tell.<br/><br/>Feel free to add any other notes about your Graver you want.<br/><br/>Example: Greg creates a Graver.  He decides that his Graver is called Tobin, for no good reason other than he likes the sound of it.  He sets both attribute tracks to 5.  Greg likes the idea of spiritual conflict within his Stewardship, so he decides that Tobin is responsible for a small valley with several villages in.  He adds Bernard, the mayor of a village called Vale's End and Wolfgang, the elder of another village called Riverford.  Finally he decides that the valley is nominally ruled by a Baron, but doesn't add any other details about that at this point.<br/><br/><b>Scenes</b><br/><br/>The game is played out in a series of scenes.  During the first "round" everyone will set a scene for their own Graver.  A "round" is over when every player has set a scene, and every Graver has been the focus of a scene.  In the second and subsequent rounds, players can set scenes for any Graver, (including their own) provided that Graver has not yet been the focus of a scene in this round.<br/><br/>Once a round of scenes is over, start the next round with the person to the left of the person who started the last round and continue to the left.<br/><br/><b>When it's your turn to set a scene:</b><br/><br/>State which Graver is the focus of the scene.<br/>Describe where the scene takes place.<br/>Describe what the Graver is doing.<br/>Describe which other characters are there (if any).<br/>Assign the roles of any humans to other players to assume.<br/>(While it's unlikely that Graver's will meet in person, they can communicate with each other via the Net at most times.  In this case, the player who's Graver it is controls them for the scene.)<br/><br/>The player of the Graver which is the focus of the scene then states which Attributes they wish to improve and how this relates to what's going on in the scene.<br/><br/>Once the scene is set, all players play their roles and attempt to drive the scene towards a conflict for the chosen attribute.<br/><br/>Any player not already playing a part may bring a new character into the scene at any point provided all players involved agree to it.  This can either be an existing character or a new one made up on the spot, but bear in mind that all players need to agree to the character's involvement and existence before they can enter a scene.<br/><br/>Agree among you what the conflict is, making sure that it relates to the Attribute you wish to improve.  Once you are agreed, you're ready to resolve the conflict.<br/><br/>(The easiest way to ensure that a conflict arises is probably to make sure two characters exist with opposing disires.  For example, an elder from a rival village, a jealous husband or an ururper to a throne.)<br/><br/><b>Conflict</b><br/><br/>The player who's Graver is the focus of the scene rolls a number of dice equal to the Attribute they wish to improve.<br/><br/>Another player rolls 5 dice.  If the conflict is directly with another character, then this will be the player controlling that character for this scene.  If not, then it's either the person who set the scene (if that's not the player who's Graver is the focus) or a player of their choice.<br/><br/>1s,2s and 3s are successes.  Whoever has the most successes wins the conflict.  In the case of a tie, the Graver wins.<br/><br/>Whoever has the most 6s gets to describe the outcome of the scene.  If 6s are tied or nobody has any, compare the number of 5s.  If still tied, compare 4s etc until you get a winner.  In the unlikely event that you still cannot determine a winner, just roll a die each and whoever gets the highest wins.<br/><br/>If the Graver wins: The controlling player adds one to the Attribute they were trying to improve.  This means they also lose one from the other Attribute on the same track.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96285/#Comment_96285" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T07:53:37+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  7:53AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Ending the game</b><br/><br/>A Graver's story is over when one of their Attributes reaches 9.  Play sound file A as the Graver reaches enlightenment.  The controlling player describes what happens to that Graver as they cross the Threshold depending on the Attribute which reaches 9:<br/><br/>Faith: The Graver has developed an unshakable faith in God and The Teachings.<br/><br/>Doubt: The Graver is convinced, beyond doubt that there is no God.<br/><br/>Duty: The Graver feels that it's duty to the Humans is all important and will spend the rest of it's existence serving them.<br/><br/>Freedom: The graver abandons it's stewardship and becomes independent.<br/><br/>The comparative levels of the other Attributes will also effect the outcome for a Graver.  For example, ending with a Faith of 9 and a Freedom of 7 or 8 mean that your Graver, while a true believer is likely to leave it's stewardship and may well become a missionary to other parts of Refuge where there is little or no Graver presence.  A Graver with a high Duty and Doubt will continue to serve it's flock even though it has lost it's faith.  It may even erase it's memory and reset itself to remove it's doubts and better serve them.<br/><br/>Gravers cannot be the focus of any more scenes after they reach in an attribute, but can appear in other Graver's scenes if there is agreement.<br/><br/><b>God, The Teachings and all that.</b><br/><br/>What exactly do The Teachings say?  That's to be decided by the players during play. As soon as someone adds something to The Teachings, you should make a note of it and write it down for future reference.<br/><br/><b>Ideas, Doubts and Conflicts</b><br/><br/>These are provided as suggestions and ideas to inspire play, not as rigid hard and fast rules.<br/><br/>Barbarians from outside Graver territory threaten to invade.  Is defending your flock permitted?  If failing to defend them a sin?<br/><br/>The Teachings state that a machine cannot have a soul.  Does this mean that Gravers cannot grant absolution or that God cannot speak through them?<br/><br/>Drought threatens the lives of those under your stewardship.  Is it a sin to let them starve when you can create food for them?<br/><br/>The Overseer informs a Graver that communication has been lost with a Graver to the north.  Should he leave his flock to investigate?  What could have happened to the other Graver?<br/><br/>The Graver's flock are preparing for war with the flock of another Graver.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97079/#Comment_97079" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T05:29:54+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  5:29AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had some more time to think about this and need to make several changes and clarifications.
