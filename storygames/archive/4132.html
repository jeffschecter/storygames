The shiny thing is what the thief came for, and she has picked it up clutching it, thus upping the ante  - her scream attracting possible others thus putting thief under time pressure and her holding object forcing his hand on choices (we know he's a thief, how far will he go - framing scenes establishing character as well as situation to follow - the situation is either the thing, the woman or some combination)<br/><br/><b>2.

Her lips curved in a satisfied smile. (a reversal of roles of predator/prey)<br/><br/>In a non-fantasy story, it's the revolver she has dropped onto the table.  Lying on the floor of the room, on the other side of the desk at first obscured, is the body of the man she has just shot and killed, one of two who broke in, the other having already made off with the same object the thief is here to obtain - the safe standing open in an obvious sign it's gone.

The shining thing is a lamp, and there are important documents on the table in the pool of light it casts. The woman knows what the thief is after, and is willing to make a deal. She's probably in a seductive evening gown, and there are sounds of a cocktail party from downstairs. "vell, hello, meesterrr zpy, ve meet again..."<br/><br/>2. She rolls out some witty quips and takes him down, because the woman is the main character and this is her introduction. And she's not a stereotypical russian vamp, but rather an exciting, sassy heroine.<br/><br/>3. For cool, all of the above, but with cyberware and ninja. For clever, this is the end of the book, and the shining object is a symbolic item that represents the man's way back to the real world from within a shared delusion, with the rest of the book written cleverly enough that this isn't a cop out ending. That last bit's the hardest; sufficient foreshadowing without blowing the plot takes a very steady hand at the helm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steven" title="Steven"><img alt="Steven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://sjhhanlon.wordpress.com/files/2007/10/tinyphoto.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steven">Steven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92768/#Comment_92768" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T12:00:25+00:00" title="September  3, 2007 12:00PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>Just so I can master my own impatience: when do we get to know where you're going with this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92772/#Comment_92772" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T12:13:30+00:00" title="September  3, 2007 12:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2007 12:33PM by Graham.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Give it a day or so more?<br/><br/>Or, Steven, if you whisper to me, I'll drop you a hint.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92865/#Comment_92865" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T23:26:05+00:00" title="September  3, 2007 11:26PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

Looking at the answers, there's <i>some</i> truth to it (although, unfortunately, some of you are such good storytellers that your cool ideas are, actually, cool).<br/><br/>There's a fuller explanation over on the journal.<br/><br/>Thanks very much.

Clich\xc3\xa9s from TV shows &amp; movies you admire.  To remedy this, Mamet proposes holding-off until a 2nd or 3rd idea suggests itself.   This is at-odds with the Impro advice Graham advocates.  <br/><br/>Mamet's second pitfall is this: Given a chance to choose What Happens Next in a story, the mind will race to devise something "interesting". (Unexpected, clever, flashy, unique.) The problem with this--  is that the actual goal should be-- to find a solution that is ESSENTIAL to the story.  Not novelty-for-its'-own-sake.<br/><br/>As an example, Mamet rejects a scene in which the concept "a student wants to impress a teacher" is depicted via the student leaping-up to catch the teacher's prosthetic arm, when it falls off in class.   Again, Mamet suggests waiting for more ideas, and choosing the un-interesting one; which gets the job done minus grandstanding.   This is partially at-odds with Graham's Impro philosophy, because it relies on multiple suggestions.  But partly in sync, because a simple, direct, even clich\xc3\xa9d solution is prized.<br/><br/>In both the above cases, Mamet is talking about pre-production: when the writer, director, and actor have heaps of time to weigh their choices and choose wisely.<br/><br/>But in the crunch of live performance, when the scene is in-progress and even a scripted performance has an improvised aspect-- Mamet's advice is more fully in-sync with Impro &amp; Graham.   That's when Mamet advises that artists shouldn't try to eliminate their anxious confused stagefright fear.  Because that would lead to hesitation which kills live spontenaity.  Rather, he proposes that the artist should ride-along at the speed of one's bad feelings and incorporate the negative junk into the energy of the onscreen/onstage fiction.  To avoid further hestitation distractions, Mamet advocates choosing the most direct, obvious, simple solutions available when last-second choices appear.<br/><br/>I see two ways to use Mamet's advice in games.   The first is to use the not-quite-real-time aspect of play to entertain a few choices before racing into an overly 'safe' or overly 'interesting' solution that presents-itelf immediately.  <br/><br/>The second way is to embrace the almost-realtime aspect of play, and not slow things down in a futile search for the 'perfect' solution, when a workable option is already available.<br/><br/>Either of these two mutually-exclusive ways could be more desirable, depending on the nature of the particular game, or the style of play preferred.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93089/#Comment_93089" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T22:43:08+00:00" title="September  4, 2007 10:43PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2007 10:45PM by Thomas D.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My answers before reading the followup posts.<br/><br/>1.

In my experience of tabletop freeform or just any old play really, there is often a moment of hesitation when something has been suggested for play. To see what the "temperature" is at the table about it. You can feel/hear when a suggestion is right: other people gasp or nod, or go "yeah". If  you get silence, someone else suggests something. When you have full buy in, you've probably got something good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
