The Summer Book Group will begin on <b>Monday 12th June</b>, splitting into as many sub-groups as required to keep the size of each one manageable.<br/><br/>If you want to take part and can commit to reading up to six game designs over the next six weeks,  come and join us at <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/101198500058433217625" rel="nofollow">Games on Trial</a> and sign-up. \ufeff                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463710/#Comment_463710" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-05T12:39:14+00:00" title="June  5, 2017 12:39PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah - he's talking about a G+ community, to be specific.<br/><br/>That's a good idea - good luck, and let us know if you need texts to work on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
