                    So the first meat-n-potatos session of our <b>Dictionary of Mu</b> game is Friday night.  And I am super-excited.<br/><br/>At work today I started thinking about the goals of the characters and how I am going to help the players get there.  I don't mean geographic goals, rather emotional and conflict goals.  I see my job as to drive the conflict forward.  If the player says "I wanna explore that dune" or "I'm gonna stab that guy in the face" I don't see it as my thing to say "nah, roll the dice."  Instead I am approaching this game more along the lines of "Okay, so what's that going to cost you?"  <br/><br/>I also am working off a group vs individuals theme.  I want to make what the players want exceedingly costly for just one person (and their demon).  Yet the players know that they are all after the Pyramid under Black Rock.<br/><br/>So now I have to help them get there.  I see the game happening with macro goals:  One is to figure out what is awaiting them in Black Rock.  <br/><br/>I have a few ideas.  Much like Fred, I plan on mapping out some relationships.  What I plan on adding to this are the motivations of the characters both in the short term and the long term.<br/><br/>The two key players in the big picture are <b>The Witch King of Stygia</b> and <b>Nimrote</b>.  I think the players already plan on pitting the two NPCs against one another.  I was going to have him show up, instead I am going to let the Witch King's paranoia get the better of him and send someone out with History-Drinker (knowing that he can summon it at any time).  I wonder which of them will lose their demon first to slake History-Drinker's thirst?<br/><br/>At first I noticedd that the Witch King was a punk - then I read History-Drinker and it all made sense... yikes! Of course I have to consider how that collides with Nimrote and his demon - the collaseum itself. <br/><br/>But we get ahead of ourselves - they are now consructing thier first kickers.  One PC will be called out by the tribe leader (and faces the possibility that his demon may get the better of him and kill his one clan head).  Another seeks to face her mentor now that she has claimed his demon as her own.  And we have yet to see what our Dragonrider is up to.                </div>
