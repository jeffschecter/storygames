So I've tried to do that, and I'm now looking for obvious flaws...<br/><br/>--------------------<br/><br/><b>Stakeholder License</b><br/>The following text is released into the public domain; no copyright is claimed for this license.<br/><br/>1. Definitions: A \u201cstakeholder\u201d is any person that has purchased a copy of the product which incorporates this license, or who has received a copy of such product from the author. The \u201coriginal work\u201d is the product to which this license is attached.  The \u201cauthor\u201d is the creator and copyright holder of the original work.  <br/><br/>2. Application: This license applies to all text of the original work, but specifically excludes all visual artworks, logos, and graphic design elements.<br/><br/>3. Grant And Terms: All stakeholders are granted the perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide right to make use of the text of the original work in any publication, so long as the following terms are met:<br/><br/><i>-All instances where such content is used must be by nature either distinct from or supplemental to the original work; the stakeholder may not create any document which duplicates the entirety of the original work or which purports, directly or indirectly, to do so.<br/><br/>-Content which is duplicated from the original work must be clearly indicated as such.  <br/><br/>-Where such content is used, copyright of that portion of the content must be noted as being retained by the author, and as being used under the terms of this license.<br/><br/>-Where such content is used, this license must be either included as written, or referenced in such a fashion as to make it reasonably possible for the audience to find or obtain it.</i><br/><br/>4. Inability To Comply: Where it is impossible, by law or government order, to comply with the whole of this license, the stakeholder may not make use of this license to any degree. <br/><br/>5. Reformation: If any portion of this License is found to be unenforceable, that portion shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.<br/><br/>-------------------<br/><br/>Now, I appreciate that the vast majority of folks here aren't lawyers, but it there anything that strikes you as plainly and obviously wrong or clumsy in there?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118919/#Comment_118919" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T04:16:38+00:00" title="January 10, 2008  4:16AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, personally I always prefer some open license, but it seems you're aiming for something different here.
