                    I noticed that there's a lot of gamecraft-oriented threads popping up, so I wanted to bring discussion back onto the common level.<br/><br/>So, how does food play into your gaming experience?<br/><br/>Here's how it works for me:<br/><br/>My weekly Thursday group at Beth's house: I eat dinner beforehand, gaming starts at 7:30-8:00, and from there there's a lot of crap candy/junk food which we eat during the night.  I've gained a lot of weight in the past five years, and unfortunately I think at least part of that is due to poor choices every Thursday. For some reason, eating crap throughout the night doesn't register on the radar.  However, I'm looking for ways around that. Namely, I've come up with:<br/><br/>Self Control  |  Coffee (light/no sugar)  |  Veggies  |  Being more conscious of my eating habits (though it's not at my house usually, so it's hard to remember sometimes)<br/><br/>Every other week's Wednesday group at My house: Starts at 7:00, and since I get off work at 6:00 (others get off work at 5:00), I usually end up eating dinner in front of the others (who usually ate). It's never made much of a problem. And after that, I rarely eat snacks and the like, just water/coffee.<br/><br/>So, half of me is wondering how food habits in your gaming group works, and any dynamics it creates.<br/><br/>The other half is looking for advice on changing an external enviornment to encourage at least self-control, if not to encourage others to eat a little better, too.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Oh, I also note that for our local house cons (usually a month apart or so), we often do potlucks.  A few weeks back (this was the con where like, halfway through, we realized we forgot to tell Jeph -=Sorry Jeff!=-) we had everything from homemade meatballs to gen-u-wine Vincent Baker Mancakes. Basically a day of revelry, food, and "Bang!"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Lots of snacks at my games have been the history so far, with Red Bull and caffeine being the most consumed products, and Oreos coming in second.<br/><br/>I actually made a conscious effort not to do any of this last Sunday, but I succumbed to some Ginger Cookies. I did manage to not drink any soft drinks though!<br/><br/>Maybe your Fitness D20 could be altered to calories and diet monitored during the game, Andy?                        </div>

                            My last group met for dinner at 6 pm at my old office. It was in a nice neighborhood with several restaurants within walking distance. So we dined and chatted, then took a short drive to my house to get gaming by 7-7:30 pm. Usually we had a dessert/snack of some cookies, brownies, etc. around 8:30 pm or so. Worked out pretty ideally.<br/><br/>I've also done the game for a bit, break for pizza, resume gaming model. Not quite as good since the flow can be lost during the gap in gaming. I'd rather get eating and chatting out of our system first, so we can really focus.                        </div>

<p>Dim Sum has many appealing qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easily finger-portable, and doesn't get the table dirty.  Makes for quick transition to gaming.</li>
<li>It is filling enough that people don't need much in the way of later snack courses (though I like that idea of dried fruits on the table, Judd ... again, finger-portable and good for sustained energy)</li>
<li>It is tasty enough that people gorge, which makes them all sedentary and contented, so they focus that little bit easier.</li>

                            Vax, I'm there with you.  Tony: I see your words, but they are hard actually entering my brain-pan: My experiences with dim sum is that local popular (authentic) restaurant Dim Sum dishes are mostly comprised of 40% grease/oil, 40% pork/shark, and 20% "other". My wife loves Dim Sum, but I only reluctantly go every few months as I often get ill from the oil (weak stomach) if I'm not careful.<br/><br/>But maybe you mean like homemade dim sum dishes?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Fred, that's great.<br/>
<br/>
Of the five (semi-overlapping) gaming groups/nights that I've been involved with over the past year or so (they aren't all on-going or every week or anything):<br/>
<br/>
1) We eat beforehand, separately. Sometimes someone brings dinner or a personal snack to the table. Sometimes someone brings a snack to share. <br/>
<br/>
2) We meet beforehand and get food - usually something asian or barbecue. When we get to the game table, we usually have soft drinks and we sometimes have snacks. One of the other players has a tendency to eat frozen dinners about 3/4 of the way through the game. This isn't me.<br/>
<br/>
3) We tend to eat beforehand/during game set-up. This is poorly organized, and we occasionally end up going out and picking something up. There is occasional snacking, but not too much.<br/>
<br/>
4) We mostly eat beforehand, some people will occasionally do so together (all are invited when this happens). Sometimes we order pizza, though.<br/>
<br/>
5) We go out to eat at a diner after game.                        </div>

                            My Tuesday night game starts at 6:00, so I am usually prepping my dinner as players arrive  and eating as we start. Generally the others have already eaten, though sometimes they do bring stuff for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Snacks vary. One fellow keeps a stash of soda in my fridge (which rarely gets raided for other guests). The players often bring snacks to share (and sometimes I have something to share - though as host, I never feel guilty about sharing far less often than the others do).<br/>

                            Okay, so like, my wife and I are total foodies and more than once drop-in guests that stay for dinner have asked in astonishment, "Do you eat like this, like, all the time?"  So... we're kind of weird.  Here's what we usually do:<br/><br/>1) Finger Food at the table -- canapes, fresh-baked bread of various kinds, veggies and dip, dried and fresh fruit, et cetera.<br/><br/>2) Dim Sum &amp; Friends -- home-made, Andy, home-made.  Don't trust those dimsum places in the stripmalls.  So we steam/fry/bake a variety of different tasty bits.  The advantage of making dim sum at home is that the same ingredient (one carrot, shredded) can be used in three different dishes.  It's relatively cheap to turn out six or so different items.<br/><br/>3) Dinner before, after, or during a break.  Occasionally we potluck; other times we just cook up a coordinated meal.<br/><br/>4) Deserts, usually baking as we play so it's warm and fresh and to die for when we break for desert.<br/><br/>5) While we've ditched the chips and candy for the most part, the gallons of soda have remained.  It's just not gaming unless I'm jumpy from caffeine.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in my sunday group without my wife, I usually hit up Taco Bell on the way there.                        </div>

                            I'm a big foodie, but I'm travelling (by train, then bus) two hours to get to gaming at the moment, so all I can really bring is biscuits. I'm also conscious that the GM is an excellent host and makes good coffee, so I want to repay that hospitality. Or he'll nuke my PC.<br/>
<br/>
(But dim sum. I could make bring those to the new venue. Thanks, guys!)<br/>
<br/>
I used to host games, and would often cook for the group. I miss that. Ciabatta and a tomatoey dip was easy and popular. But I also got easily annoyed at how few people made pleasant guests - bringing food, tidying up, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Weekend games happen at either a coffee shop or an old-fashioned men's social club, so we make do with drinks and junk.<br/>

                            Usually my groups eat dinner together, either before game or durring a long break. The communal aspect of sharing food is pretty important to our social structure, I think. Games where we don't do a meal together never go as well. (Odd, but true. I only realized it myself recently.) <br/><br/>The meals change depending on who is involved, as we've a professional chef, several different kinds of vegetarians, and one near carnivor in our groups. For each game we tend to have either a set or rotating scheduel that determines whose turn it is to deal with food. Usually we have one person who does the whole dinner, though they often ask folks to bring sides and such in to help. <br/><br/>Snacks and other finger foods are at each individuals choice, due to differences in diet we don't do a lot of sharing and passing around the table. We used to, but increasing restrictions and the stuffiness of age have pretty much put an end to that.                        </div>

                            Deciding on food for our (once-RPG, now-board) game nights is a spectacle of passive aggression.  Once in a while somebody will have a strong desire for takeout from the Mediterranean deli or Chinese delivery, but if not, we spend at least half an hour going "What do you want?  I don't want to choose.  Make Ken choose.  Ken's not here.  We need to get something, I'm starving."  This usually results in our getting a pizza from a local joint, which nobody really craves but nobody will reject either.<br/>
<br/>
I try to cook big dishes for everybody when I can, but I don't have a car so getting fresh groceries is a pain.  Still, all this talk about homemade dim sum is intriguing.  I would really like to see a spinoff thread with some fairly quick, solid game-night recipes.                        </div>

                            Our two gaming nights are basically pizza nights.  I'd personally love to do more, but since the crowd is currently composed of relatively poor students (myself included, since I'm going back to school), pizza seems to have the best investment/return ratio, in terms of time.<br>
<br>
So far, two nights of pizza a week isn't doing TOO much to me.  But I was overweight before.                        </br></br></div>

                            It varies, but generally:<br/>
<br/>
* Some kind of straightforward dinner beforehand (spaghetti with garlic &amp; oil, something on the grill, or something that spent all day on the back burner), which we eat before the game.<br/>
* Cocktails or scotch or brandy or beer, depending on mood.<br/>
* A pot of French press when alertness levels drop.<br/>
<br/>
When we have during-game snacks, they tend to be snacky-sweet things from the store, like two-bite brownies or such.                        </div>

                            Generally, we get snacks and stuff from the conbini (convenience store). Since we start at noon, we usually spend about an hour eating lunch (or late breakfast or whatever). Most of the "food" is weird Japanese snack crap and shit sandwiches from the conbini (Japanese snacks can be just as bad for you as anywhere else). I try not to eat much myself during the game (I'm too busy!) and I just drink water and work up an appetite.<br/>
<br/>
When possible though, we grade up and eat some fruit - oranges or sliced melon, or straight corn tortilla chips (when we can find them) with homemade guacamole (when we can find avocados).<br/>
<br/>
When we play at one guy's place, he cooks up a pot of fiery Thai or Indian curry, which is very welcome! At another guy's place, we go to this British pub near his house where they have a roast lunch buffet (all you can eat roast beef, lamb, and pork). Only danger there is getting so stuffed and mellowed out on the meat and Guiness that we all get sleepy afterwards!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, after the game, we go for Indian curry or to an izakaya.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Sorry for any undecipherable Japanese-English in this post. I been here too long...                        </div>

                            I always liked having lunch be eaten during the beginning of the game, and then to go out to dinner afterwards as a "breakdown of the session" and keep the group dynamic going.  I think one of the failures of the last gaming group I attended was that we so much just went on our own way after the game; there was no, "I can't believe you did that!" and "I think our GM has it in for us," socialization.  <br/><br/>As for types of food, I used to make lasagna or big breakfasts when we had game night at our place way back (depending on the time of day.)  Snacks are a must for anything over four hours, IMO, so I think about it carefully, especially in light of, "Am I at someone else's house and have to think of their carpet/couch?" and "Will I be rude eating something extremely yummy and not sharing?"                        </div>

                            My regular group usually starts with lunch of salad rolls, or salad and pastries/quiche.  We eat biscuits and cheeses, dips, and carrot, celery and cucumber sticks as an afternoon snack.  Dinner is usually a lovely meal cooked by one of the players.  She likes to cook.  She likes to host just to have a chance to cook for more people.  We also snack on fruit.  And in summer we scoff frozen grapes.  TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re small, easy to eat, tasty and lovely and cold on a hot day.  We drink mostly fizzy drinks, though IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve taken to drinking water and only occasionally having a fizzy drink.  I drink a lot while roleplaying (holding a glass is a fantastic way to convey character that I find very natural and easy).  During dinner we usually have wine.  On special occasions like birthdays, we have champagne.<br/>
<br/>
We usually stop play for meals.  They instead become the time to discuss the game, what the characters are thinking and feeling, and speculate about various things.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to devote the sort of focus to playing that we like when using cutlery and thinking about putting food in your mouth rather than stabbing yourself in the chin with a fork.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also unfair on the player who cooks to have the rest of the game going on while sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the kitchen.  Our group places importance on those not in scenes being an engaged audience and enjoying whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on.  Even though the kitchen is open to the area we play in, we feel it would be unfair to have cool roleplaying going on when she has to split her attention between the game and the food.                        </div>
