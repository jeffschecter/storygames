I can't recall all the names now, and I can't find any of the sheets, but I recall we had a Vizier, an Earl, a Princess, a Chairman, a Contessa, and I played a Bishop.<br/><br/>So, as we'd all been serving our own drinks, I took the initiative to ask the Vizier about the time he escaped a carpet being carried by giant eagles over the Dancing School of the Silken Princesses. I think I might have front-loaded the story a bit much, or perhaps explained the intent of the game slightly wrong, since he didn't embellish the story much, and instead basically recounted the details as I had described them.<br/><br/>He then asked the Earl about how his travels to the New World had led to the invention of mango chutney. The Earl told a tale of adventure wherein the people of his enormous island all sailed across to invade South America, since their blind scouts, able only to pick out foods by smell, had told them that there was a most delectable treat. I interrupted by asking how the people of the Earl's country managed to sail, since they were known to have two left hands. Accepting my wager, he said that in fact the boats from his land were towed by mer-people, who they had long ago subjugated.<br/><br/>The Earl then asked the Princess about the time she saved her father from the three-headed ogres who had kidnapped him. The Princess reaaaaally got into the game, playing up the "fairer sex" jokes, and telling a tale of how the ogres kidnaped her father to force her into marriage with them, and how her fantastic swooning skills sufficiently distracted the ogres so that she was able to send her companion sneaking about to free the captured king. I tried to trip her up my mentioning her little lapdog, known to irritate and enrage ogres, and she turned that to her advantage by a) telling a hilarious sub-story about the dog, and b) making the dog part of her distraction.<br/><br/>She asked the Chairman about how he came to overthrow the previous regime of his nation using only a spool of thread. The Chairman's tale was a bit more "modern", in that it was clearly inspired by various communist revolutions. With the 18th century overlay, it was fairly amusing. The spool of thread had been given to him by his teacher, and he used it to weave the noose which was used to hang the evil King Um ("And so the evil king... umm..." "Ah, yes, King Um! A renowned tyrant!") An interruption: -- "aren't the spiders of your nation unionized, and don't they prevent any from weaving without their consent?" -- was integrated into the tale by saying how the oppression of the regime had gotten too much, and the spiders had joined the glorious revolution, and another, that the Chairman had fallen into a trap in the king's castle, was rejected with a blanket insult to those born to power.<br/><br/>The Chairman then asked the Contessa -- half asleep due to a late hour and too much wine -- to tell of her people, who were able to win a great war despite being always asleep. The story was a bit meandering, but told of how her people learned the knack of duelling whilst sleepwalking, and dreaming up great nightmares to fight their battles for them. The Chairman got political and accused her of using the workers in the battles of the upper-class, but it was rebutted with a comment about the low-born playing in the games of the aristocracy.<br/><br/>The Contessa then asked me how I protected my parish from an attack of pear trees. I told a story about how I, before being a bishop, had been a renowned duellist, and so, when the pear trees of my parish had decided they would no longer give their fruit for free, I was called upon to duel their leader and bring back some semblance of order. During my duel, I skewered pears from the tree, as well as occasional passing livestock, and when I finally drove the tree into a corner, the carpenter who had previously been the trees' ally (an accepted challenge) changed sides, chopped the tree down, and made a fire, upon which I cooked my skewer of pears and various meats, feeding the village.<br/><br/>The votes were done, and the Earl carried the night.<br/><br/>The game went over really well, but it was pretty clear that people were finding their feet. There weren't nearly as many challenges as their could have been, and some people's stories meandered a fair bit, or didn't have a great oomph to them. The next time I play, I'm going to make sure everyone is aware of the technique suggested by the author -- to think up an ending first, and then tell a tale to match. Also, now that people have the rythym, I think challenges will flow more freely. I'll also try and pressure people out of playing characters like the Chairman, who aren't really in keeping with the spirit of the idle nobility telling tall tales.<br/><br/>Several of the assembled seemed keen on the idea of playing in public, perhaps at a not-too-crowded restaurant or a more quiet pub. A good public venue is tough to find in North America, I think, due to our bars treating themselves as "business to sell you alcohol and a certain lifestyle" rather than gathering places. I think it would be a fun game to play for money, with the understanding that the winner would use the purse to buy a round. There was also general agreement that we should try Es-Sindibad's variant next time.<br/><br/>Also, if I were going to break it out as an end-of-party entertainment like I did this time, I'd probably just play <i>My Uncle the Baron</i> instead of the full game.<br/><br/>Overall, not only a good party game, but a good gateway game, since both of the aforementioned "curious outsiders" went away with a gleam in their eye that I well recognize. Maybe I'll invite them the next time I get a jones to play <i>Dust Devils</i>!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snikle" title="snikle"><img alt="snikle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snikle">snikle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233317/#Comment_233317" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T16:53:05+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  4:53PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After having visited a few pubs in Germany a few years ago, I have always wanted to find a similar place here in the States. Moderately lit, with wide, long booths that offer a bit of privacy and plenty of room, and a calm and semi quiet atmosphere. It would be a great place to play a bit of the old story game while slogging a few back. Playing for rounds is a great idea, especially if you had a game that could use that and expound upon the story.<br/>Still looking for a place like that in the US though.....<br/>Know any places in Nashville like that??                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233324/#Comment_233324" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T17:40:02+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  5:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, one of the main mechanics of ABM involves bidding to put elements into another player's story, and it's suggested by the book itself to use real money, and let the winner use the purse to buy a round. From reading James Wallis' blog, I get the impression that he actually does that regularly, in his local (Wallis lives in London).<br/><br/>I can't suggest a good bar in Nashville, having never been. Nor can I suggest one in any of the places I have lived, sadly. Too mcuh focus on keeping the music loud so you drink rather than talk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233335/#Comment_233335" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T20:18:44+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  8:18PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a lovely write-up, deadly - many thanks.
