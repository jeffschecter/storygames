Why?  Because it made me laugh, and maybe it will make you laugh, too.<br/><br/>Thursdays is something of a workshop night for the Peoria group.  This is when we playtest games, both from other people and our current projects.  Lately, we've been testing Ralph Mazza's forthcoming game <i>Blood Red Sands</i>.  Since we're constantly tinkering with the rules, it's not as satisfying as actually playing the final product will be, but I enjoy both the design work and the game play as it actually evolves.<br/><br/>I think that the rules are coming together, because last night's conflict was tense and challenging for both sides.  Plus, it included some seriously over-the-top narration, which I feel properly demonstrates the necessary Metal attitude required to play <i>Blood Red Sands</i>.<br/><br/>The scene is set.  Shard (the hero of the current ordeal) has rallied some of the men of the freehold, and they are fighting to recover control of the freehold from a band of sorcerous shepherds.  (It's a bit complicated.)<br/><br/>I'm playing Shard, and it's my turn to be the Chronicler.  So I say how we surround the building where Cam, the leader of the shepherds, is holed up.  Then we set the building on fire.  Then Cam comes out, hair and body aflame, and bows before Shard, yielding control of the freehold.<br/><br/>Gabrielle is playing Cam and the shepherds, and she cannot accept this narration.  So, in proper form, she slams her hand on the table and says, "It shall not be!"  And so we go to conflict.<br/><br/>Crystal is playing the formerly Unliving freeholders who were rescued by Shard and the freeholders.  She decides that she wants to join the conflict on the side of Shard.  Tactically, this may not have been the best option, as it's in Crystal's best interest if the shepherds win.  However, Crystal wants to get in her shots to earn some VPs of her own.  So, into the conflict she goes.<br/><br/>Conflict begins.  I tell Crystal that she needs to make the attack for our side.  So one of the former Unliving calls into the house, trying to get Cam to come quietly.<br/><br/>This doesn't work.<br/><br/>Instead, Cam leaps from the building, hair and body ablaze, to attack Shard.  Shard flips Cam over his head and slams him on the ground behind him.  Then he crushes Cam's face with his heel.<br/><br/>And that's when things started to go wrong for me.<br/><br/>Cam reaches up, grabs Shard's foot, and breaks his ankle.  And not just, "Your foot doesn't work" but "Bones are protruding from your leg" kind of broken ankle.  I didn't have the necessary dice to block this attack, so I had to eat it.  I get handed a new Trait:  "Debilitating Limp  d10 black".  Great.<br/><br/>So now Shard is also lying on the ground.  I talk about a foot sweep, forgetting that Cam was already on the ground.  The rest of the group is mocking me.  Crystal points out, "You can't foot sweep; you need another foot to stand on."  And Ralph comments, "Yeah, but standing on your bloody stump would be seriously metal."<br/><br/>Did I mention that the catchword for this game is "metal"?  I mean, like Durham 3, horns in the air, spikes upon spikes upon spikes, uber-macho with umlauts Metal.  Yeah, it's like that.<br/><br/>So, I'm thinking, "What would be suitably metal?"  Then I hit upon it.<br/><br/>I say, "I stab you in the eye with my bone."<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, this was the high point of the evening.<br/><br/>(It helped that I could back this up with a d10 and d8, showing 6 and 5, both being yellow, which basically means that I could reuse both dice.)<br/><br/>Sadly, Cam blocked, but he had to refresh his dice to do so.  This is a big deal!  I explain.<br/><br/>Imagine that you're playing <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, and all the dice that you use for Raising and Seeing (except when you Take the Blow) go into a pool of used dice.  Then you can burn one of those dice to get all the rest back, rerolled and able to be used.  That's what "refreshing" is.  There are only three refreshes in any conflict, and you can't refresh if someone on your side was the last to refresh.<br/><br/>So, while Cam and Shard are duking it out, I'm counting on being able to refresh.  However, my "ally" Crystal chooses to refresh early, just to stop me from being able to refresh.  So now I'm running low on dice and have no way to get any back unless Gabrielle refreshes.<br/><br/>In other words, even though I didn't actually stab Cam in the eye with my bone, that move saved the day for me.<br/><br/>Gabrielle refreshed.  Soon after, I refreshed.  Despite further trickery from Crystal, I managed to prevail.<br/><br/>Bloody and battered, Shard triumphed over Cam, who was finally forced to bow before Shard and yield control of the freehold to him.<br/><br/>It was a good night.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121939/#Comment_121939" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T14:27:13+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  2:27PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What made this combat especially gratifying for me was how it highlighted one of the key differences between BRS and Dogs mechanically.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Dogs, you look at your dice and say..."huh, no way I'm winning this one" and you give, yielding the stakes.<br/>\nIn BRS, often times what's at stake is of secondary importance to the opportunity to score points (you score points for causing "fallout").  So instead when you look at your dice you're thinking "huh, no way I'm winning this one...I wonder how many points I can score before I go down."<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the fiction, Shard had allied with the Freeholders (me) who had been betrayed by their allies the Nomadic Shephards (Gabrielle).  So when the Shephards took the Freeholder leader prisoner and tried to take over my town, Shard jumped in to take it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the meta level however, Gabrielle betrayed me because after helping me get my faction's goal, I was trying to pump her for more before helping her get her faction's goal...she was having none of it and promptly stomped me silly.  Seth saw the opportunity to score some points against Gabrielle (who having recently been fighting me was already somewhat battered) and so "came to my rescue"...for purely selfish reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cool twist mechanically was, that even though Seth finally won the knock down drag out fight, beat Gabrielle and claimed the stakes (taking over the town for himself)...Gabrielle scored WAY more points than he did...so at the meta level, she totally won that fight (I however, had scored few points against her, losing both in the fiction and at the meta level...which is all good, because last week I totally owned everybody)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother nice thing that this session demonstrated is that I think we finally have struck a pretty good balance between hero and faction power.  The Faction players have been able to keep the hero in check, wearing him down, keeping him from running off with a huge victory.  But at the same time, the huge amount of effectiveness sitting on the hero sheet makes us equally willing to court him to help us acheive our goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm looking forward to getting the niggling mechanical effects out of the way and enjoying a few sessions of pure play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121944/#Comment_121944" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T15:10:05+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  3:10PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, crap, that sounds like more money coming out of my wallet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121945/#Comment_121945" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T15:11:18+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  3:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Seth saw the opportunity to score some points against Gabrielle (who having recently been fighting me was already somewhat battered) and so "came to my rescue"...for purely selfish reasons.</blockquote>\nPlus I figure that it's too late to stop you from achieving your goal, but maybe...just maybe...I can stop Gabrielle from achieving hers.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br/>The cool twist mechanically was, that even though Seth finally won the knock down drag out fight, beat Gabrielle and claimed the stakes (taking over the town for himself)...Gabrielle scored WAY more points than he did...so at the meta level, she totally won that fight</blockquote>\nYeah, I know.

Aside from the fun of just doing it, to make it part of the game requires some juggling.  <br/><br/>There has to be something worth winning at stake or its just a fun dice game.<br/>You have to be able to just pick up and challenge someone's hero (even across play groups) without alot of extra restrictions...or people won't bother.<br/>And yet what you win can't upset the balance of play within an ordeal or between heroes.<br/>And the balance has to continue to work whether a player never bothers to have their hero duel another hero, or whether they duel constantly.<br/>If the thing that you win in a duel also feeds back into the fiction of the Chronicle, that's even better.<br/><br/>...and a Mortal Kombat hack...that totally has to be done...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121974/#Comment_121974" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T18:33:10+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  6:33PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2008 6:42PM by Wolfe.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there anything wrong with it being just a fun dice game?<br/><br/>edit: that really isn't a sufficient question. <br/><br/>Rather, perhaps it can be something that contributes to the fiction... I mean, it'd be cool to have these heroes that have clashed before, but haven't resolved, once and for all, who's better. When they meet again, maybe as reluctant allies, it adds to the metal tensions of the conflicts.. Both of them trying to outdo each other more than they really care about whatever faction they're fighting for or against. <br/><br/>Out of fiction, it can just be counting coup. I used to duel using the TRoS system with this guy, and even though each fight was just a duel, we got to roleplaying a tiny bit during them, "remembering" past victories and defeats as our characters fought. <br/><br/>If something has to be at stake, maybe the fights don't effect the in-play balance of power, but they can modify the "victory points" at end game.. Maybe Thoroff did a little better than Coran points-wise, but Coran defeated heroes more often, so it edges him just a tiny bit ahead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121994/#Comment_121994" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T01:28:01+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  1:28AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, my thought is this...if its just a fun dice game, then people will just do it because of that...exactly like your TRoS duels.  There was nothing in the rules for that, it was just an obvious thing to do (and I did a bunch of that too, particularly with the little program utility that Brian had worked up.  So if I'm going to actually spend pages and words on formally adding Hero vs. Hero duelling to the game, it needs to do something more...it needs to justify the ink spent on it so to speak.<br/><br/>Bragging rights (aka counting coup) is a potential "thing" and maybe that winds up being all that's necessary...but that strikes me as being little more than "just doing it because it sounds fun"...which if it turns out to be fun, people will just do without me needing to write about it.<br/><br/>Affecting the in game fiction is an option.  But in a lot of ways the fiction isn't what's being fought over (i.e. its not so much a game about whose version of the story wins the way Universalis was)...Seth characterizes the fiction as being the arena that the player fight within...not the stakes that players fight for.  So I'm not sure if this is any more of a reason than bragging rights.<br/><br/>Victory Points actually have a game impact.  They determine who gets to play their hero next and who wins the right to play the Witch King in the final ordeal...so modifying VPs is a definite possibility, but has to be approached with caution.<br/><br/>All great ideas, but the juggling continues.  But please keep 'em coming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122381/#Comment_122381" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T11:54:10+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 11:54AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I agree with Ralph.  It's only worth writing about if it actually affects the game.  Now, I happen to think that it is indeed a fun dice game, and I'd love to throw down Hero vs. Hero for laughs.  But, if it's going to be in the game (beyond perhaps a brief note that says, "Hey!  Fighting Hero vs. Hero can be fun!", then it needs to be part of the gameplay.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd want to see an effect that is useful to the victor of the battle without awarding VPs.  Playing through ordeals should be the path to victory.  It seems to be that side-duels should give a bump in effectiveness to assist in the next ordeal, but in some way that eventually ceases to reward ongoing fighting of side-duels.<br/><br/>Here's an idea.  Maybe a Hero can earn one colored die, based on his victories in between ordeals.  It starts at a nothing.  Each win increases the die size, while each loss reduces the die size.  It can't be bigger than a d10.  So, by battling four times <b>and winning</b>, you can earn a d10.  Of course, any loss sets that back a die size.  And, for fun, maybe the loser of the duel says what the color is, based on the narrative events of the duel.  So, in essence, the last person that you defeat tells you the die color.<br/><br/>Once you enter an ordeal, the die is locked in, and it goes away at the end of the ordeal.<br/><br/>And the duel doesn't have to be combat per se.  Maybe it's a foot race, or a competition to scale a cliff, or something like that.  You could even include a chart with possible conflict arenas that gets diced on, or maybe you roll Legend and the lower roll chooses.  Or something like that.<br/><br/>This way, fighting side-duels matters to the game, but it doesn't become an exploitable advantage.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122965/#Comment_122965" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T07:45:19+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  7:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's not a bad idea...but would the duelling really be fun enough that you'd want to duel 4 times+ between each of your hero's ordeals...4 ordeals if you make it all the way.

So, if you lose one duel, you slide to a black d4.  Two losses to a black d6.  And so on.  Therefore, one Hero's gain of a colored die equals another Hero's loss.<br/><br/>This probably fixes the continuous duelling "problem" (or, as I like to call it, "competitive edge"), because a Hero who is already battered from successive losses in duelling might not want to risk another loss, thus increasing his black die penalty.<br/><br/>And would it be fun?  I will refer you to Versus mode of <i>Sons of Liberty</i>, which has little strategy, but which I would gladly play for hours at a time.  If I could take my custom Hero and throw down against someone else, using the BRS system, which is highly strategic, plus have a bit of gambling in the process....  Yes, that would be quite fun.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122990/#Comment_122990" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T08:48:18+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  8:48AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bearing in mind that I don't know anything about this game or system except what I have read in this thread, but speaking as a potential customer:<br/><br/>This sounds like it rocks!<br/><br/>It particularly rocks if there is a 'Versus Mode' with various kinds of combat and non-combat competitions between characters.  I love <i>Sons of Liberty</i> and I love <i>Agon</i>.  In <i>SoL</i>, Versus Mode is just another way to play, when you have only two players.  In <i>Agon</i>, though, competitions between characters are there for a purpose mechanically <i>and</i> in the fiction.  <br/><br/>What Seth is talking about upthread seems like it would be to a purpose within the fiction (a different purpose than <i>Agon</i> uses, put a purpose still): winning duels gives you an advantage in your next ordeal.  That sounds to me like motivation enough to use that subsystem of the rules.  And if there is a risk involved (black dice), then it offers the player a meaningful decision to make, which is always good game design.<br/><br/>I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more about this game!<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123029/#Comment_123029" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T10:04:21+00:00" title="January 30, 2008 10:04AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Dain you can read a little more about the game in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5249&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a><br/>\n<br/>\nVery shortly I will be putting the finishing touches on the External Playtest Version.
