professional boxers go ten rounds and say, "They only threw punches for ten rounds," when boxing is footwork, conditioning, defense, counter-punching, the corner giving feedback, etc. and etc.<br/><br/>My goals with this stuff is to work it to a point where we can have exercises or games or whatever that help us get better at the bits of gaming that make good games happen.  I want to not only mention that we threw a knock-out punch but tell everyone what we were doing with our footwork and our hips and our breathing so that others can do so too.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133095/#Comment_133095" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T21:16:57+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  9:16PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>John Harper and I were talking about Judds gamer skills post, and we came up with what we felt were three strong pieces of advice that digest all of the social contract advice given there and elsewhere.<br/><br/>1.

I'm going to stick with bad metaphors for a moment.  Stay with me.<br/><br/>When you are dancing with someone who is really good, you don't have to tell them that you want to be spun.  Sometimes, your hips just tell them things or the song tells them.  But it'd be pretty damned boring if you walked up to your partner and said, "I'm going to spin you and dip you and then dip you again."  Please don't pick at the metaphor too intensely.<br/><br/>With gaming, I want to put flags up on my sheet and not really know what my GM is going to do with them exactly.  I can have a Belief about wanting to kill my brother and find out through play that my brother, actually, is an alright guy and my PC was just a prick whose head was on wrong.  That'd be cool if done well.<br/><br/>If done well...there's the fucking rub.  If done well...<br/><br/>Reading flags and responding in a way that makes sense to the other players but still surprises and still stays within genre is something that I tend to do pretty well and I have no idea how or why or what I do to make it happen.  But I don't give the players exactly what they want, that'd be dull.  I open it up to the table and we all come out with something we never expected.<br/><br/>So, wait, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> feels fine to me but the answer to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> isn't to listen to your players and give them exactly what they want.

But that's only my opinion.<br/><br/>Playing is the best exercise, without a doubt.<br/><br/>But I think there are things that we do and do well that couldbe cultivated.<br/><br/>Scene framing is a huge one.  People do it so often that it is like breathing.  But that doesn't mean that everyone breaths well.  So many scenes and parts of games go well because we know when to take our time with a journey and set up a scene along the road and we know when to just start the scene at the crossed spears of the emperor's guards in front of the palace gate.<br/><br/>Even just thinking about some of these things in isolation can be a big help.<br/><br/>So, I agree and disagree.  The best way to get good at this stuff is to get out there and play.<br/><br/>But I think there are little parts of our gaming, techniques that can be thought about in a way as to improve them.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5746&amp;page=1#Item_39" rel="nofollow">And for the record, here is the original thread mentioned in the OP.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst" title="zacharythefirst"><img alt="zacharythefirst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst">zacharythefirst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133378/#Comment_133378" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T16:19:16+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  4:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2008 4:21PM by zacharythefirst.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might argued that before you even know what to ask for what you want, you need to be involved, be it in the planning or actual play.
