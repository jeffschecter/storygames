When running Solipsist I was struck by how character creation *was* world creation. The objectives and goals of a Solipsist character utterly define the world they are playing in, they are definitely protagonists, in that the world is all about them. In contrast when playing Shock world creation is also character creation, you create a world and the characters just fall out of it, they are intimately bound together.<br/><br/>In most games, though, its not the case. The world is something quite apart from the characters, indeed most settings are designed for many different parties of characters. The world is definitely not all about the characters, and the characters are not all about the world, instead it is a cruel and indifferent sort of place in which to have your adventures. No matter how important the characters are to events in the world the world itself is not all about them and their stories.<br/><br/>I'm just wondering why we (that's gamers in general) usually make worlds like that. Is it because we (the individual people) know that the world *we* live in isn't all about us? Is it because we want to present a wide world where no path of adventure / story is already implied?<br/><br/>Also, what other games that I've not played wrap world creation and character creation together in this way?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126042/#Comment_126042" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T14:08:00+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  2:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I'm just wondering why we (that's gamers in general) usually make worlds like that.

The static elements are things the players can always count on and use to learn the setting. The dynamic elements are things that blow up and go too fast.  Once I had that down, I could easily distinguish intro scenes from action scenes and I could get investment in things before they change dramatically and thus excitement when change comes.<br/><br/>A lot of "hey we just created this world together" games lack investment in elements, so when change comes to them, everyone shrugs. "Oh golly, this world I barely know has become this entirely new world I barely know."  <br/><br/>That's a bit rambling but there you are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126045/#Comment_126045" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T14:18:37+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  2:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see where you are coming from, certainly with Shock's system of adding Minutae. You are supposed to introduce Minutae in conflicts as a way of further defining the setting in ways that will guide future scenes, but I found that we often scribbled them down and then forgot all about them, because the setting was always changing in these little ways and we weren't invested in that change in the way we were about the core elements ... or like we would have been if our meticulously detailed fantasy Kingdom had just been overthrown by invaders and was dramatically changing!<br/><br/>But if you are telling a focussed story which is all about some characters and their goals then you can still have a world that both revolves around that and has static elements. For example you can have a world where the main characters are the leaders of the world's greatest nations, and involved in the world defining war, instead of minor rulers in a local situation in one corner of a sprawling setting.<br/><br/>(as an aside I run long-term GURPS campaigns most of the time and they are usually just the opposite, bit MMORPG style worlds in which the players wander here and there having various adventures. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126046/#Comment_126046" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T14:22:25+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  2:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I'm just wondering why we (that's gamers in general) usually make worlds like that.

We've been taught that way. It's like asking "why do so many roleplaying games feature combat as a central mechanic (even "story" games like World of Darkness?" The original model, which grew from war gaming and fiction, is all about having a pre-defined setting to play in.<br/><br/>Burning Empires and Blossoms Are Falling (for Burning Wheel) both incorporate character creation and world creation, although they are distinct steps, they're tied together.<br/><br/>Spirit of the Century is a bit of a bridge crosser, but the players have the power to create or define as much of the world they want through Aspects.<br/><br/>I understand, although I haven't played it, Mortal Coil has world creation as a part of character creation.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age is entirely built around the concept of world and character creation occuring at the same time.<br/><br/>From the playtest I played at Gen Con, Other Worlds will have, at least as an option, world details emerging through play as characters are defined.<br/><br/>Universalis is more of a game about world creation (or at least story creation, including the world to a large degree) than it is a typical RPG.<br/><br/>PTA starts with world creation, which brings about characters, much like you describe Shock.<br/><br/>In fact, I'll hazard a guess that most independent games work this way.  Some by necessity, like Hero's Banner, SotC or The Shadow of Yesterday, which only lightly paints a setting because they are small books with no supplement profit structure like big RPG companies, giving freedom for it to be developed and colored by characters and by play. Some by intention, like PTA, Shock, Burning Empires, Universalis, In A Wicked Age, etc., where world creation is explicitly a part of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126047/#Comment_126047" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T14:29:33+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  2:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You see I wouldn't have said that IAWA was like that. Sure you create a world, and then the same Oracle draw tells you about the characters who are there, but that isn't the same as creating a world that is *all about* those characters in the way Solipsist or Shock do. It is creating a world that those characters are in, and a story which is about those characters, but the very fact that the characters can continue from story to story, appearing in different stories, tell you that the characters are not only for that story.<br/><br/>I'm looking at setting creation where you say the setting would be meaningless, or not exist at all, without those characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126049/#Comment_126049" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T14:46:09+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  2:46PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2008 2:49PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, it's not pure creation after the first chapter. But in the first chapter, if we draw "A ruthless warlord and his thugs" then the setting element is meaningless without the warlord or his thugs. And all of the elements are tied together as setting and character.<br/><br/>Let's say one of the thugs goes to another story. The player picks an element that to tie the thug in.  If we also draw "A fleet of warships preparing to attack a peaceful city" then we might bring back the warlord as fleet captain (in which case, he's not meaningless) or the player of the Warlord forces him in if there's nothing that fits and they want to play him, in which case the setting elements get informed by that and he fits one way or another.  Even if you buy them in, the setting and character will be tied together, and you'll never end up with a "cruel and indifferent" story world.<br/><br/>It sounds like it's an issue of degrees.  The setting won't be entirely meaningless without certain characters (and certain characters it would be), but it will certainly be influenced in major ways depending on what characters end up in play for any given chapter.  Are you interested in games that don't fall on the hard line of "pre-defined setting" or are you just curious about games that fall on the hard line of "not even a hint of a pre-defined setting"?
