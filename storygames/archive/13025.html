I really don't want to go back to boring fighters, thanks."<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this looks enough like a nut that I can hit it with my old-school perspective!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm happy not to have powers as long as other people's resolve at roughly the same speed. In 1E Gamma World last night I played a guy whose sole useful mutation was improved smell, and it was just as fun for me to say "I scout around" or "I flee in terror" as it was for others to say "I activate my death field" or "I throw my head at him and bite his ankles", because all of these had story-level consequences right away; some required an attack roll and 3d6 damage, but none required a vastly different kind of accounting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a secret genius of old-school D&amp;D; was the one minute combat round (note that its best things are often the ones most reviled as nonsensical). One minute story time lets one guy go "I swing at the troll," another go "I read a scroll," and another go "I sneak out the back door with the treasure chest and hide it in the fountain." 4E inverts this; it takes minutes of play time to cover 10 seconds of story time. That's only fun if you have powers to read through; inventing crazy stuff to do is best done hot, while choosing between pre-defined game options is best mulled over.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also happy not to have powers when my crazy stuff is resolved at roughly the same mechanical level as other's powers. A glorious thing about Gamma World 1E is that interpreting the effects of mutations often requires the same on-the-spot creativity as figuring out what'll happen when I try to throw a sack over the head of an invisible creature. The lack of built-up mechanical support for mutations means they often just happen, just like my running away just happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, the mechanical support for powers in 4E is so extensive that making something up feels like you're not playing the same game as anyone else, even when you use p.42 to translate it into the same mechanical framework.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293698/#Comment_293698" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T22:46:09+00:00" title="September 16, 2010 10:46PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you there, the 1 minute combat round is actually pretty handy, although it's rather hard to reconcile a single attack roll to 1 minute. Overall I like the change of not having powers for everything as well, I don't mind others using it necessarily, but I definitely think it completely changes the game. Playing LFR I quickly changed from thinking about creative uses of powers using prose to creative uses of powers using game mechanics. Both are fun, but I'd rather just play a tabletop wargame at that point. If that's what D&amp;D has become, why not, it's as fun as getting together to play magic, but I'd almost like it if the pretense of adventure were stripped off and it were specified ahead of time that you'd fight a troll and a hag at a cave entrance in a swamp followed by a black dragon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293713/#Comment_293713" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T02:27:52+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  2:27AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally I'd go a step further and say that what you're really looking for is a totally abstracted round time, where it's not necessarily clear how long has passed unless for some reason it needs to be.<br><br>-Ash                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293729/#Comment_293729" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T05:49:24+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  5:49AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ash, in D&amp;D; abstract round time doesn't play well with things like spell durations and determining when the next wandering monster check will happen. The default here is that there are usually reasons you need to know how long has passed during combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often get around that by leaving the amount of time during each round abstract, but then saying that the time between when the fight starts and when you're ready to move on is always one minute for each round that the combat took. If you just met a stirge, won initiative, and shot it full of arrows, you're good to go a minute later after you recover your arrows. If you had a grueling ten-round fight against a horde of orcs, it takes ten minutes to both conduct the battle and then recover from it; maybe the fighting took only sixty seconds, but then you spend nine times as long binding your wounds, cleaning and sharpening your blades, searching the bodies, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome fun you can have at home is to set your kitchen timer for a minute and see what you can do in that time. I can open a door, run out of my apartment, run down the stairs, go out the front door, touch the curb, turn around, unlock the front door, run up the stairs, unlock the apartment door and be back where I started. I can also have a lengthy broomstick duel like in Princess Bride; here the single attack roll represents the point where I go "you see, I am left-handed too!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
