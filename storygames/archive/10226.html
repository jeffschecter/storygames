Apparently, he's gotten frustrated trying to order stuff from IPR -- can't tell if that's him or IPR or both -- to the point of thinking about getting the Dreaming to place an order for Gamma Ray through their account.  Crazy.  I told him I'd try to help him sort things out.  <br/><br/>He also said he'd bought 6 copies of Carry through an Alliance sale (WTF?) and sold them all, so he found two more somewhere.  I told him that I knew Nathan from Boston and that I'd did layout for Mortal Coil Revised.  Those two together blew his mind, I think.  Microfame is so weird.  I also mentioned that I knew John Harper, but apparently he didn't know who that was (ICE BURN!).  He'll know soon enough, I'm sure <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyway, the indie games he had on his shelf were: Burning Wheel (1), Monster Burner (1), Magic Burner (1), Carry (2), Seven Leagues (1), and maybe one more thing that I don't remember. But he, personally, is really interested in playing more indie games, so he's committed to making something happen on that end.  I mentioned maybe running some Dogs or Mouse Guard demos and his eyes lit up.  He said he was thinking of putting a Primetime Adventures game together and would let me know.<br/><br/>I told him about Story Games Boston and how we'd run an open indie games night every Wednesday for almost 3 years.  He said he'd be interested in putting something like that together, and I pitched him a few ideas about how to make sure it continued to support both indie games and the store (since SGB was really bad at generating revenue for Pandemonium and Pandys were really bad at taking our money).<br/><br/>He said he more or less couldn't get enough people running 4E in his store to support the interest.  He said the store had 150ish friends on Facebook who were "committed gamers" (I quivered in fear) and he was hand-booking people into slots for open games, to try to make sure a few folks didn't monopolize everything by just registering for whatever was open.<br/><br/>I was sitting there reading GTM and waiting for him to help a customer buy some Magic cards when two 20-something girls walked in talking about the various merits of Scrabble.  They looked around the shelves a bit but didn't really see anything worth picking up and looking at, so they walked out.  The store itself is pretty interesting in that regard.  It looks very much like a trendy boutique kind of place, all white and "spaceship-like" (as Eric put it) on the inside.  Fancy shelves filled with $60-100 board games by Fantasy Flight.  But it doesn't really carry many games that appeal to a hypothetical "general" audience that isn't excited by genre fiction trappings of zombies, dungeons, and spaceships exploding.  The most mainstream games I saw were Dominion and Powergrid.<br/><br/>Anyway, all in all a worthy experiment and I really hope the store does well.  Hopefully we'll be able to work something out, both so the store can carry a bunch of indie games (though not as many as the Dreaming, since there isn't enough space) and so I can run some one-shots in the store and share the love with other folks how may not have had the opportunity to play indie games before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eryops" title="Eryops"><img alt="Eryops" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i732.photobucket.com/albums/ww325/Tibor_02/ceilingcat22.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eryops">Eryops</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228546/#Comment_228546" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T23:20:42+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 11:20PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>There is no indie at American Eagles, but if you'd like micro armor from the late 80's it's awesome.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=288" rel="nofollow">I think I bought the last thing that could be referred to as 'indie' from American Eagle about two years ago.</a> Still haven't cracked the yellowing shrink wrap off of it yet...<br/><br/>But yeah, RPG wise, if you're looking for some old picked-through 2e AD&amp;D, the newest 4e D&amp;D, old Shadowrun, RIFTS, old Marvel FASERIP modules, DC Heroes, and other surprising things from the mid-late '80s, you might want to check it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228548/#Comment_228548" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T23:46:22+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 11:46PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Gamma Ray - I talked to Eric when he first opened up, and his intention is to run the hip &amp; clean version of the "Dungeon" style game store (i.e. aimed at hobbyists) as opposed to the family style game store (which Blue Highway Games on Queen Anne currently has covered in spades).<br/><br/>I know John Harper went in shortly after GRG opened and gave Eric the indie games spiel...

But hey, that's cool. I should drop him an email.<br/><br/>Maybe a SGBoston-style thing should have a (low) cover, but if you buy stuff, that counts as your cover for a couple of weeks, or something.

The "cover or purchase" option is a good one.  Biweekly is something Eric (of Gamma Ray) suggested, actually, and I definitely agree.  Also, having sign up and mandatory rotation (if you played last time, other folks get priority this time), so you're not playing with the same people all the time.  I think the new thing I'm proposing will be more like convention demos at GoD -- i.e. clearly not a substitute for forming your own groups to play these games more extensively, but an introduction to folks who are interested and an effort to familiarize Gamma Ray customers with what's actually on their shelf.  Y'know, like a Tupperware party, but with indie games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228625/#Comment_228625" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T18:01:30+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  6:01PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>He did mention that "some of the GPNW folks" had been in to talk to him about indie games.</blockquote>\nYeah, I don't know if Brandon's stopped in yet, but the rest of us all have at some point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228663/#Comment_228663" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T23:32:23+00:00" title="August 29, 2009 11:32PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only got to visit Gamma Ray once before I moved, but I really liked the owner.
