How would you reassess your life? What would you do when your duty and your convictions pulled you in different directions. Where do you go when everything you believed was a lie?<br/><br/>More detail, including examples and resources, at the <a href="http://realms.co.uk/covenant" rel="nofollow">Covenant webpage</a><br/><br/>You can currently download the <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=56473&amp;affiliate_id=2909" rel="nofollow">Covenant PDF at RPGNow</a> for a $10 price tag. This is half what the book costs, so you\u2019re getting plenty of goodness for your e-buck (but I would say that).<br/><br/>The PDF also contains all the errata and a few extra tweaks. Nothing major was added, but if you own the original book, drop me and email (matt / at / realms / co / uk) and I\u2019ll hook you up with a PDF.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152306/#Comment_152306" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T19:36:11+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  7:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Covenant is a fantastically fun game.<br/><br/>Motifs and Conventions are a great idea for bringing mood and tone to a game. The character sheet has a magnificent visual hierarchy that tells you "start here, threaten this, end here" visually. The game has enough setting to ground you, and enough freedom to make it fit your vision.<br/><br/>Last game we played, we were a society cell stirring riots in an attempt to disrupt the Messiah's message from being delivered to the people of Paris, thus redeeming Apocalypse. We had a sexy riot cop, and a brothel owner, and a psychotic avant-garde artist who used human sacrifices in his art, and a shootout, and a daughter almost losing faith in her father, and underworld dealings, and a suave martini lounge, and... it was grand.<br/><br/>I would be buying this if I didn't already own it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152352/#Comment_152352" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T02:02:17+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  2:02AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, thanks for the very kind words!

Covenant is a wonderful game. The very process of character creation kick-starts the story and gives it real impetus. I guess I sound like a bit of a cheerleader for Covenant. Well, maybe I am. But it has given me and my friends some great gaming experiences.
