(Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger cover).<br/>\nI was hooked immediately.  As a fan of the old monster movies I thought I had found a piece of heaven.  I would spend hours drawing from the black and white photos found in FM.  I wish I had kept it up.  FM is probably partly responsible for my love of bad puns too.<br/>\nI subscribed to the mag and kept it up for years, enjoying every issue.  My first publication was a picture I sent in of a creature (Nim) I created for them.<br/>\nForry was the ultimate insider of the genres.  He knew everyone it seemed.  One of my childhood dreams was to visit the Ackermansion and see all the memorabilia.<br/>\nI would suppose that he was one of the biggest influences in science fiction and horror.  <br/>\nThere are quite a few tributes out there if you are interested in learning more.<br/>\nAnybody else have any memories of Forry or FM or their influence on you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184178/#Comment_184178" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T17:15:07+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  5:15PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was very sad to learn of Mr. Ackerman's death.

He lived apologetically with an unequaled appreciation of these things we enjoy and escape with and I salute that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
