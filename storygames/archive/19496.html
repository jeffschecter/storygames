I left it there, to play Dark Age - and I had a ton of fun with that and I am waiting for Vincent to put out the update... desperately waiting.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, waiting for Dark Age got me started again on my own project. It is different in mechanics, although of course still an AW-hack, and from Dark Age it inherits mostly the XP markers-per-Move approach.<br/><br/>So, here are some of the documents, if you guys would be so kind to give me some advice: <a href="http://www.daimongames.com/listing/AW-TCOJudas/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.daimongames.com/listing/AW-TCOJudas/</a><br/><br/>There is document with Rules (aimed at the Players, with Moves and basic info about the setting). And there are 8 Playbooks - mostly for the regular mercenaries: the Barber (healer), Horseman, Hunter, Leader, Raider, Scout, Sellsword, Veteran.<br/><br/><b>I need to finish</b>: <br/><br/>- The GM document (Principles and Moves - Missions - City Front, for Jerusalem, and City Map - Other Fronts - Monsters, how to make and use them). <br/><br/>- And to make the Sorcerer Playbook (the only one with real access to magic, which is still quite a mess and might turn out to be more than one playbook).<br/><br/><b>Some highlights</b>: <br/><br/>Anyway, if you've read until here, and still you're not convinced to have a look at the link above, let me see if I can get your interest with the main points of the game:<br/><br/>- Iron Fist: a company of mercenaries, this is what links the characters. They work in a middle-age fantasy Jerusalem, divided between 2 different religious sects.<br/><br/>- Stats: Edge (cool), Steel (hard), Charm (hot), Brains (sharp). There is no Weird but Shadow, although Shadow is not for sorcery but for sneak and lie and such. Sorcery will rely on Brains.<br/><br/>- Added some counters: Health (instead of HP or Harm - and the harm system is changed so that the Inflict Harm - to an NPC - and Suffer Harm - for PCs - are Moves at the core of the harm system). Taint: important, measures the soul's corruption (and I am trying to make it entirely Moves' related, not discretionary, and I think it's nice)<br/><br/>- XP and advancements: xp similar to DarkAge<br/><br/>- Advantage Die: this is similar to the Escalation Die in 13th Age. Each Player has one, and it replaces the +1 forward/ongoing that I've seen often forgotten at the table. I hope a physical token will work much better. The Advantage Die increases or decreases with the Moves and (resetting it to 1) can replace a die rolled for a Move that rolled low.<br/><br/>- Moves: there are Basic Moves, Social Moves, and a bit of strategic combat (with different moves for it - I hope not too many). I love the moves and their crunch, but well, I might be completely wrong... although I hope this part to be fun...<br/><br/>Anyway - thoughts, suggestions, critiques, are all welcome: <a href="http://www.daimongames.com/listing/AW-TCOJudas/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.daimongames.com/listing/AW-TCOJudas/</a><br/><br/>-- EDIT --<br/><br/>post title changed from 'middle age mercenaries' to 'medieval mercenaries'<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433588/#Comment_433588" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-09T10:26:49+00:00" title="June  9, 2014 10:26AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is nifty stuff!

You could "swap" it for any die you rolled after-the-fact. It would start with a value of 1.<br/><br/>So, let's say you rolled two 6's (a 10+), but you were willing to downgrade it to a mixed hit (7-9), you could swap your special die for one of the 6's. Now your result is a 7 (6+1), but you special die is a 6. Next time, you can swap it in to improve your result, replacing it with one of the dice you rolled. Let's say you roll a 2 and a 4 (a miss): you could replace the 2 with the 6 for a 10+ result, but now your special die is a 2. Or you could replace the 4, giving you a 7-9 result (2+6), but it your special die is now a 4.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433675/#Comment_433675" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-10T16:21:24+00:00" title="June 10, 2014  4:21PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read the thread title the same way CarpeGuitarrem did.<br/><br/>I very much like the Status Counters.

That's pretty clunky, I think.)<br/><br/>Why did you decide to have a separate Harm move for NPCs?<br/><br/>(To clarify, I don't mind have a Harm move for PCs because harm is often caused by an MC move - which involves no roll - and then triggers a player move. But having a player move trigger another player move is a much longer process. Intuitively, it seems to me that the options you've included in the NPC Harm move could be integrated into your general fighting moves. But keeping it separate allows you to differentiate damage from effective combat fighting skill/outcomes, I suppose.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433684/#Comment_433684" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-10T23:51:33+00:00" title="June 10, 2014 11:51PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> - <b>the die swap</b>, with the special die, is an interesting option.. I don't recall seeing it in the AW hacks I've read... If you find that hack, post us the link.<br/><br/>Here though, the Advantage Die <i>replaces </i>the +1/-1 fwd and ongoing. It's a little sacrifice of 'simulation' (you gain +1 to your Advantage Die in a fight, and use it half an hour later when talking with someone else... the 2 events are not related), but in return you get a physical token, and single one, instead of +1/-1... The GM can decrease the Advantage Die to show penalties and difficulties.<br/><br/><b>The Suffer Harm move</b>: yes, can be improved in the erase/ignore harm. You should have seen it at the start. It had 3 different ways to mark Harm: cross like this if it counts like a penalty to your roll but you recover at the end of the fight, cross like that if it gives you no penalty now, but becomes permanent later, cross like this and like that when it's final :-)<br/><br/>I made it down to just mark/erase, and I hope to make it better.<br/><br/><b>Inflict Harm for the NPCs</b>: inflict harm does 2 things. <i>First </i>you have no health, no static counter for HP on NPCs. It's not like, man 5 HP, troll 8 HP. Both get hit and take HS - harm suffered - and roll with it. Rolling the Inflict Harm is like rolling for damage. It feels a bit old style, but I thought it would work better, in the context of how combat works here, than a static damage and HP counter.<br/><br/>Of course you have options to make the Troll stronger - you can give it "Ignore HS ooo" so technically you're still saying that the troll has 3 HP more than a man. But then you could write "Ignore HS if not a blessed/magic weapon", "Ignore HS if not fire harm" etc.<br/><br/>I understand the point about the double roll, though. It's true, it's longer. Saying we always did it in the past (roll to hit, ok, roll for damage) doesn't justify it. But definitely the basic adversaries will go down quickly anyway...<br/><br/>Which brings me to the second point: more HS, more are the chances of the Player rolling 10+. At that point is the Player, not the GM, deciding the NPC or monster fate. This is the <i>2nd advantage</i> of Inflict Harm...<br/><br/>Now, offering kill or knock-out, cannot be in a standard combat move, or fights, even important ones, risk to be over in a single blow. Still, they can... you need a lucky roll twice though, to hit and inflict harm... it sounded more likely, more precise, to me.<br/><br/>So it's true, it's a double-roll, but I believe a lot of Players will actually enjoy the combat and the harm moves combinations. If not, well, on page 10 it says you can ditch the Inflict Harm for a static number of hit points.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> - <b>about the Counters</b>: Health is used only in the Suffer Harm Move. It tells, from +3 to -3, how good or bad your character condition is... Because of it's range, it's easy to use it as modifier or even alone - like a Stat. Perhaps I could even list it under Stats.<br/><br/>The others: Gold and Debt are basically just money and debts with the Iron Fist or others. I guess they'd be used by the GM to push the action, either with rewards or by having people showing up to collect debts. I guess they could be used in some moves, as modifiers, when money matters. In fact, in the Move Hit The Market: "You can spend up to 3 Gold and add the spent Gold to <br/>your roll to ensure success".<br/><br/>Their scores are open to go higher than 3 and so if you used them as modifiers there must be a cap or something to it (in any case, if you're ready to spend a fortune like 10 gold to get a 10+, don't roll, we'll sure find you someone that want to sell whatever it is you're looking for, for that price!)<br/><br/>Taint - goes up depending mostly on sorcery and 'magic-like' powers, and down when doing good deeds as in the Moves text. This part I will review over and over, because it will be important for sorcery and to keep players a bit on the edge. Mostly, though, Taint will be a measure of how 'corrupted' a soul is... this is regardless of the christian religion in the game. A character could be following another religion, and different values... having a high Taint means he's not loyal to his 'best self' or something like that thing... honor... stuff like that :-)<br/><br/>I don't know if it can fit in certain moves as modifier. Perhaps for the sorcerer - perhaps without X Taint the sorcerer cannot perform a certain Spell, that requires a darker soul.<br/><br/>As for how it goes down - as a Player you don't spend it, you don't get rid of it, except for some points, related to certain moves.<br/><br/>The GM uses it: a point, a GM's Move.<br/><br/>Rings - can be definitely used (although not "spent") in modifiers for rolls on authority for example, within the Iron Fist. <br/><br/><i>On the other hand, and this is true for most of the values, I hesitated to use Roll 2D6+Stat+Counter</i> (at least too often) because it adds numbers that could either: send you way above or below the usual ranges; or otherwise cancel each other out (i.e. roll 2D6+Brains that is -1, +1 gold =0). When this happens, you have one rule more to remember, one variant more to check in the Moves sheet, which does not bring you a great deal of variants in the game, though. But I guess they can definitely be used, if someone feels like it, without breaking a thing...<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433685/#Comment_433685" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T00:04:59+00:00" title="June 11, 2014 12:04AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2014 12:07AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps "use as modifiers" was not the greatest suggestion.

I'd only enjoy bothering with the numbers if they showed up in rolls, or in the GM making moves they couldn't otherwise make, or something.  Are there any basic moves where it makes more sense to roll +Rings instead of +Charm?

On the other hand -you'd want some solid information to based yourself on. I am thinking gold/debt and Rings mostly, because Taint is definitely something you'll need to track with a counter.<br/><br/>I was reluctant to make each of them with -3 to +3 counters... although I confess, in the first character sheet draft, all of them looked like Health with a -3 to +3 scale. The reason why I am not there (yet? now? never?) is that I am afraid to introduce far too many moves. Roll +Rings makes a great deal of sense when you're working within the Iron Fist.. when you use your position to issue orders, resist them, find information, obtain equipment and so on... and perhaps roll +Rings would even work outside the Iron Fist, in Jerusalem, as a leverage. Someone who'd see you with 20 rings on your arm would probably hesitate before challenging you to a fight, knowing you're a veteran. But you see, roll 2D6+20 is... too much?<br/><br/>Oh..... wow...... just got maybe an idea. Roll 2D6+Rings. (but you just ignore the units).<br/>So 0-9 Rings - roll 2D6+0.<br/>10-19 Rings - roll 2D6+1. and so on...<br/><br/>Why no negative? there's no point in having an Iron Fist leverage if you're not a member... so no negative.<br/><br/>As for gold-debt... I might consider a -3 +3 counter again... with 'unstable' replaced by 'in debt'... instead of making money a counter, it would make it a general wealth overview... <br/><br/>Thanks everybody for the precious input so far!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433884/#Comment_433884" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-15T22:57:46+00:00" title="June 15, 2014 10:57PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I uploaded a version 0.04 to the website (same link).

Some time in the near future I will have to set this aside and let it rest for a while, but right now I know I have to keep adding something every day as long as I keep having ideas (even the smallest ones).<br/><br/>So after attending yesterday a great Pearl Jam concert in Milan (absolutely OT) - I've managed to sit today at my desk and do some more work - in spite of the annoying bureaucracy demons chasing me (as mentioned above). The result is an updated Sorcerer playbook: with 3 out of 6 lists that are compiled: Soul-Binder, Alchemist, Master Caster. To do: the Dark Arts, the Elementalist and the Demonology.<br/><br/>As usual, feedback and suggestions (here or in PM or email) are most welcome.<br/><br/>Do you like the approach to the Sorcerer? does it balance 'inspiring' and 'flexible' spells with more 'crunchy' and 'mechanical' ones?<br/><br/>The thing I love about AW and a lot of its hacks, is how by just reading a playbook I start to have all these ideas about what I'd like to do in play (I presume once again it's the result of this masterpiece of mr. Baker that is AW - where you can focus so much about what you'd like to do with your character and less and less about mechanical elements of the setting and the opponents...).

It also has the awesome effect of making it more likely that a dabbler with little knowledge of "the true art" of magic (ie someone who just picks up the Spell Move as an Advance) is more likely to have to rely on demons for assistance.

The wonderful thing about moves and playbooks (I think I wrote this already) is how elegantly pieces fall together, thanks to the AW framework behind it. I started drafting the playbooks lacking a lot of insights about this topic and discovered stuff as I progressed.<br/><br/>Discovered even certain subtleties, as the one you mentioned, while I designed them. Specifically - the fact that other character types will be forced to use the 'dark' side of magic was something that came out making Bound to the stars a Move - while initially it was sitting in the generic magic rules. It's again wonderful how just moving a little piece of instructions from here to there causes a snowball of consequences even outside of the single playbook, and it's really great when it creates such a neat result.<br/><br/>Well, again, thanks Vincent!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/revel911">@revel911</a> - I perfectly understand where you're coming from. I had/have my own doubts but I didn't have time to playtest this enough to make a final call about this. It might be that I will cleanup the Moves, merge some of them, like you suggested.<br/><br/>The two reasons behind the original design that has a lot of basic moves are these:<br/><br/>- XP: Players are driven to use different moves to have the chance to mark XP. This means that at the table you're likely to see slightly different approaches in different moments. Of course a Player can decide to re-use a Move he already marked and thus gain no XP, just advance the fiction. But at least in my experience, the meta-game evaluation of what gives me XP and what not, is a critical factor for a lot of Players (not all, but a lot of them - so I decided to address this out-of-fiction behavior by translating into different in-fiction approaches)<br/><br/>- Inspiration: sometimes general moves are absolutely great. A single line describing a generic trouble generates fantastic fiction in one case, and an absolutely different but equally interesting challenge in another case. But often, especially if you play in the evening, if you're a bit tired, if you've been playing for 2h or more... the GM brain starts to miss a beat, and I saw rather dumb descriptions coming out of too generic Moves. Perhaps I am just a bad GM myself :-) but I found more precise Moves, with exact constrains, exact consequences, to be more helpful to the GM, and at the same time, fair to the Players that know in advance what kind of a mess they can get into, with a 7-9 or a 6-. Also, I found that a lot of inexperienced Players like - and use more - exact moves rather than generic ones<br/><br/>I hope that even if you don't agree, this helps you and other readers to understand where did all that looong list of Moves come from.<br/><br/>Ammo - in fact was initially in some playbooks, but in the end basically every character can get this type of weapons, so it fits better, I believe, as a general move, common to all. And again, I had a dice based random mechanic, similar to what you described. I searched for the text to share it with you but I don't seem to find it (way too many revisions on these documents!). In the end I went for something in between an exact number and a completely random one, because that leaves to the Players the possibility to act to be prepared (like equip themselves in advance, or get worried while they see the ammo reducing when they have no chance to buy/find more). And it's one roll less to make - considering that with Inflict Harm and Suffer Harm I basically reintroduced the Damage Roll, I wanted to keep other rolls in combat to the minimum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434543/#Comment_434543" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-29T08:48:36+00:00" title="June 29, 2014  8:48AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2014 8:50AM by revel911.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            XP wise .... as long as there is a good amount of moves to give xp and it isn't a condition where you only have 10 moves, and it takes 10 xp to advance, then you are fine. You could also lesson the xp to advance down if you need as well.<br/><br/>I just feel that a few less moves, again only maybe 1 probably per group .... opens up game play rather than people arguing "Well, it should be this vs it should be that."<br/><br/>About Ammo, part of the reason I love AW so much more than DW is the lack of micro-managing things money and ammo. Does it really matter if I have 10 or 11 arrows? What matter is that I do or do not have arrows, correct? Also, if I am a sword based character, then this is another basic move I have to memorize that I will never use. I think it could be better used by having a general equipment move. Could be water, could be a grappling hook, could be arrows, could be throwing knives. When you roll, you find out if you do or do not have enough, and you the player states what it is that you need.

I added "or better" to the Move text.<br/><br/>The reason for the +1 AD is basically the advantage you gain by having precisely that. I assume in most of the cases the Players will resort to this move when they really need something (and without it they cannot do what they want) or when they hope to gain an advantage, like "Ok, I will Face Danger to climb this, but I am well equipped and I have a hook and a rope" or "Ok, now I roll for Lie and Deceive, and tell them this and that. Note that I dressed up like this and that, because I have a set of spare clothes for this kind of mundane occasions"... and when they roll a 10+ meaning they are really seriously equipped for the matter, they take the +1 to the AD.<br/><br/>It's like taking a +1 forward because your preparation move went well. Here you have it to the AD - you can use it, or save it for later (which is not consistent with the fiction speaking from a simulation point of view - your bonus should be restricted to the given action - but it's much easier to track, and I found it good to show when a character gains an edge by doing several things well in a row...)<br/><br/><b>Taint </b>is judged as doing something bad. Poisoning someone to save many is not bad <i>in your opinion</i>. I am not saying I think different: but there are books of philosophy written about this sort of subjects... I could also argue that saving someone when you are ordered, if you risk your life by doing it, or you do it as a medic, definitely is not easy and definitely should make you feel better afterwards.<br/><br/>But Taint is not only doing something bad: is taking something from demons, from the dark world of the shadows, losing honor, and so on. It's all regulated in the Moves exactly because I didn't want it to be subjective. It's not up to the GM or the Players whim. It's like this and that. Not all the people that are convinced that they kill <i>for the right reasons</i> are then happy and comfy and able to sleep well at night. This is Taint.<br/><br/><b>About the number of Moves</b>: I started a pbf playtest, and I hope to have one at the table soon. It's summer and a lot of people I know are in vacation. Once I have more than just basic feedbacks about it, I will make some more exact decisions about this.<br/><br/>Not sure about making <b>Gold into Reputation/influence/status</b> or so. It can be interesting but: within the Iron Fist the number of Rings is what counts the most - and that's accounted for by using the tens of the Rings for certain moves. Out of the Iron Fist, your reputation is what gives you perhaps a leverage for a threat. Is something you need or need to make up for at the moment... at least, that's how I saw it. But again, I will give it some thoughts. All these suggestions are interesting and very useful.<br/><br/>About the <b>graphical representation</b>: anybody willing to help, is absolutely welcome. I am not good in that compartment: I work basically only with text editors and tables and lots of patience, but the final results are just acceptable, nothing more that this.<br/><br/><b>A general question for everybody</b>: I am working to put together a manual that would be real - not twenty but perhaps two or three hundred pages (A5) that would cover the entire game: from a slightly more detailed setting, to more precise advice and rules for the GM, better guidelines for adventures, missions, monsters and NPCs and so on. I never worked with kickstarter and such, and I wonder if anybody has alternatives suggestions for how to finance this.<br/><br/>For example: if I use kickstarter and print in Italy, I spend more for shipping than I should, given that the product will be aimed to the US market. Since I don't expect to make big bucks out of it: selling at cost for example on Lulu.com would be acceptable?

I would talk to <a href="/forums/profile/James">@James</a> Mullen on google+, the person who did the 'Hood. He decided to go the Lulu route as well because he is from Great Britain and did not want the shipping costs. As far as I know, he has had a fine experience with the process. I laid out the book for him in digest form and set it up on Lulu.<br/><br/>Graphics. I will gladly help if you ever need, I enjoy doing it (I am an Art Director for a large corporation) ..... though I think you have a fine start. You are currently formatting the book at 8.5x11, correct? What is your final size? How does the character sheets format in that size? I think the books need a bit more flair and the center border around the notes a little less generic, but overall it looks real good. BTW, I personally prefer the character sheets with the characters in silhouette. Also, since you can take moves from other playbooks, you may want to add a box for that on the same panel as the "notes" box.<br/><br/>Playtest.

More important: all the Playbooks have been revised; there is at least one new move for each one of them (some are quite cool: I really like the last move of the Veteran, for instance. Go check it out).<br/><br/>Mechanically speaking there are now 5 counters in parallel to the 5 Stats. While Stats are pretty much stable (unless you take Advancements or Debilities), the counters often go up or down in the game. Counters are: Health, Gold, Spirit, Prestige, Equipment.<br/><br/>Each of them, comes with a Condition (a bad one!) with the GM hitting you hard for them (Unstable, in Debt, Tainted, Infamous, Unprepared). As the taint (now gone, and replaced by Spirit) was in previous versions, the counter are pretty much managed mechanically within Moves, so there is not too much to worry about what counter goes up/down when.<br/><br/>There's a new move for fighting very large monsters or for when you're badly outnumbered. It is meant to be harsh.<br/><br/>What else? The character creation instructions are not in the Playbooks anymore, but in a separate sheet, to print separately. This saves space on the Playbooks themselves.<br/><br/>Also, I added info for the first session, added info for the Fronts, a Front Sheet, the Characters' Front. Expanded the guidelines for monsters, added guidelines for human opponents...<br/><br/>oh, I almost forgot: <b>there is a new Playbook, the Priest of Judas.</b> <a href="http://www.daimongames.com/judas/download/ThePriest.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.daimongames.com/judas/download/ThePriest.pdf</a><br/><br/>As always, any feedback is welcome!
