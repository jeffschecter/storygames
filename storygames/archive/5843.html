That includes the monsters.  In some recent playtests, crafty players and powerful PCs conspired to kill off their monster opponents before the poor evil creatures even had a chance to swing.  That's no good!</p>\n<p>Naturally my thoughts went to rules balance.  Did the PCs have it too easy?  Were the monsters too gimped?  After all, the previous iteration of the rules let monsters play out as chumps, and I was concerned that I hadn't fixed the issue properly.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Here are some things that came to mind as I reviewed the current rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Very Heavy Damage</strong><br/>\nI considered an issue that my players and I chatted about after our last session.  The base damage for Very Heavy weapons, I decided, was throwing off the balance.  Being able to count on three points of damage just wasn't right.  Consider it changed.  Similarly, Very Very Heavy weapons have to be tossed out the window.  I added them to the bear ability on a whim, despite my better judgement.  If you have your copy of the rules handy, scratch out the mention of Very Very Heavy weapons and make this note for Very Heavy weapons:</p>\n<p><em>Very Heavy weapons do 2 damage on a regular attack and get +2 damage when they hit you In The Face.</em></p>\n<p>It's a pretty serious gimping of VH weapons, but I'm feeling pretty confident that it's the right thing to do.  Three damage as a base is HUGE.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounter Distance</strong><br/>\nWe played out three seperate combats in our last session.  Afterwards Brandon remarked that he noticed a really big difference between one combat where the PCs started out with an arena between themselves and the monsters and another where they started in the same arena.</p>\n<p>There are no rules right now about how to arrange the initial arenas.  But consider that even a single extra arena between the PCs and their enemies means additional turns where one side has to move to get into range while the patient side can do a bit of Assisting and Showing Off to build up a couple extra tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Mooks ARE Hit Points</strong><br/>\nIf you want your monsters to have more hit points, throw in more mooks.  No self-respecting PC can resist cleaning up a handful of mooks before moving onto the bigger threat.  Give the monster the power of Minions and the mooks' HP becomee the monster's HP.  Even without the power, more mooks = more HP.</p>\n<p>Run defense with your mooks.  Place them between the PCs and the monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Flight + Ranged</strong><br/>\nIf at least one of the PCs can fly or has a ranged weapon, but not all of them can or do, you can direct who's the attacker and who's the support by having a flying monster.  Give that monster a ranged weapon and suddenly the monster can occupy an arena that not everyone can attack.  Use in moderation.</p>\n<p><strong>Throw + Blast</strong><br/>\nThe Throw power does not require that the target of the throw action be the same character that was injured by the corresponding attack action.  It's implied, but not required.  Use the Blast power to satisfy that implication.  The monster makes a Blast attack, the lesser-armored PCs are injured and the greater-armored PCs are (potentially) thrown into another arena by the blast.</p>\n<p><strong>Mist Summoner + Reach</strong><br/>\nIt's pretty obvious, but yeah.  You can keep the PCs from determining the type of arena, no matter how big or fast they are.  Everywhere they go, the monster has the arena advantage.  Use with lots and lots of moderation.</p>\n<p><strong>Heave + Ranged + Fast</strong><br/>\nWith this combonation, the monster can keep moving while being able to attack pretty much every PC on the board.  The players will really have to get creative to corner and kill this beast.  Players who don't feel like thinking creatively about the arenas won't have a chance.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I also have some ideas for some anti-group powers for monsters.  However, for now, I want to give these existing strategies an opportunity to regulate the issue.  Especially the more mooks = more HP thing.  I think that might end up being a cornerstone to PC/monster balance.</p>\n<p>For those of you who have had this issue, do you see a solution popping out?  That is, do you think any of these things will help the fun?  Let's talk about it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130680/#Comment_130680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T18:00:14+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  6:00PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric,<br/><br/>These things all sound great!

I didn't feel that it would have been fair to say that they had to fight extra mooks when they went to all that trouble to avoid them. I guess I could have given the monster another power (Fast would have worked for my troll king) but I'd prefer not to be adjusting things on the fly to respond to events. <br/><br/>One of the big issues is the fact that there are no defenses when an incoming attack hits you. <br/><br/>How about you allow people to spend awesome tokens to nullify a token spent on the attack? That means that (a) you still can't totally avoid an attack; but (b) you can reduce the impact of an attack against you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130690/#Comment_130690" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T18:31:47+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  6:31PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I didn't feel that it would have been fair to say that they had to fight extra mooks when they went to all that trouble to avoid them.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Agreed.</p>\n<p>I'll think about this issue some more.  I'm strictly opposed to increased defenses and token nullification.  It's one of those cases where it's just something that I don't enjoy.  As a player, I don't want to see my tokens nullified or my target's AC shoot up.

That means that the person who moves into range first is likely doomed. <br/><br/>Maybe the way around is via initiative, having moves happen before other actions, but in reverse order?<br/><br/>Using my troll king as an example, this is how the fight played out.<br/>They started in adjacent arenas (the PCs used a chalk door on the ceiling below his bedchamber to drop him and the bed only into the corridor they were in)<br/>Troll king won initiative, his two consorts were in the middle.<br/><br/>Round 1.<br/>Troll king and most players all show off, get lots of tokens<br/>Consorts advanced to PC arena.<br/>Final PC kills both consorts<br/><br/>Round 2.<br/>Troll king advances<br/>PCs kill him using vast numbers of awesome tokens.<br/><br/>Now the troll king had initiative, but in this situation that made it much more dangerous for him. If moves went first in reverse order, winning the initiative is still an advantage. It does make the round a little longer, but it might be worth a try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130697/#Comment_130697" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T18:45:10+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  6:45PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hrm.

I think the damage modification will work great. Yes, Very heavy weapons are weaker now, but I think 3 and 4 damage weapons were realy too strong. And remember that there's still the possibility to combo with the Weapon Bond talent that gives you two face dice. Thinking of this talent : when you have multiple face dice, do you do +1 damage for each "0" on a die (for a potential total of +2) ?<br/><br/>And, just to be sure : are very heavy weapons still for normal PCs with enough size or do you need the bear's talent. If you still need the Mighty Grip, do you still keep heavy reach (2 damage, +1 AC) and heavy range weapons (2 damage, ranged) for this talent ? <br/><br/>And did you have the opportunity to play again ? Do you feel the game is the one you wanted. We are having a lot of fun with it. I hope you still do also.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Antoine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130773/#Comment_130773" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T05:54:29+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  5:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hiya Antoine,</p>\n<p>Yeah, if more than one face die comes up as a 10, then that's +1 damage for each of them, even if it's more than two face dice.  Since the odds of showing more than one 10 in a single roll is pretty remote, I don't think the occational extra damage will hurt things.</p>\n<p>Normal PCs can use VH weapons now.  The Bear talent is for combining Reach or Ranged with Heavy or Very Heavy.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our game planned for this past Saturday was cancelled due to a death in Mark's family.  I haven't heard back from him since he went out of town to attend the funeral.  I hope everything is well with him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I think I may have figured out where the core of the issue is at.  It occurred to me on one of my early flights this morning.  I think that <em>maybe</em> the Awesome Tokens are a little too awesome.  I'm currently pondering over the possiblity of reducing them to +1 to hit or +1 damage, as opposed to +2 to hit or +1 damage.  I think this change would keep the tokens very important and useful without letting them become overbearing and essential.</p>\n<p>But I'm not sure yet.  More pondering is called for.

So, when you show off, you place your awesome tokens on an opponent (or opponent) in your area.  These are then available for use whenever you attack that opponent.  Assist works the same, except that you are placing tokens for someone other than yourself on the opponent. Unlike aspects, tokens on an opponent only helps attacks by players to which they belong (you could change that, but it would remove any difference between assist and showing off except which attribute you used).<br/><br/>This approach doesn't let you just sit back and accumulate tokens -- to use show off or assist you actually have to get within harms way.<br/><br/>Another nice nice thing is it makes showing off targeted -- you are intimidating/impressing one particular opponent, which I think leads to nice images.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131436/#Comment_131436" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T16:51:43+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  4:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice idea Peter - I'll give it a try                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131438/#Comment_131438" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T16:53:26+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  4:53PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, how about just making show off and assist only work when you are in weapons range?
