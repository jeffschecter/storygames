We're happy to answer any questions. It might make more sense if we talk about it than if you just read the notes.<br/><br/><b>Notes from marketing talk</b><br/><br/><i>Paul Beakley, Elizabeth Shoemaker, Graham Walmsley, Jason Morningstar</i><br/> <br/><b>What are your goals?</b><br/><br/>Are they financial? Based on user metrics? The number of actual play reports?<br/><br/>Goals should be measurable, so social validation and aesthetic considerations are Not Goals. Additionally, pay attention to goals in various spheres, not just financial ones.<br/><br/>There is a general feeling, between Jason, Graham and Elizabeth, that Paul should teach us how to sell lots of copies of our games.<br/><br/>SOTC is selling <a href="/forums/profile/175%2Fquarter">@175/quarter</a> now in softcover.<br/><br/><b>Who do you want to be?</b><br/><br/>    * Jason wants to be John Harper: a guy who makes tasty game morsels everybody wants to eat.<br/>    * Graham wants to be Fred Hicks: someone who really enjoys the business side.<br/>    * Elizabeth wants to be a sort of anti-Rebecca Sean Borgstrom: an outgoing weirdo who is capable and ambitious.<br/><br/><b>The audience</b><br/><br/>What comes first, the audience or the inspiration?  Commercial tool or artiste?<br/><br/>Graham comments that we don't often think about the audience before the game. We develop the game first, then try to find an audience for it. There's essentially no reason we can't start threads to scope out what people are interested in. Jason strongly concurs - an artiste model, not a "give them what they want" model.<br/><br/>Paul suggest that we should have a commercial sensibility. Think about the audience before the product (to an extent).<br/><br/><b>Telling the story</b><br/><br/>Marketing is telling a good story. Why should someone care about you?  Your game?  Your product?  Your experience?<br/><br/>"Marketing" connects Market research with the customer transaction, and we do this poorly, probably because we do no marketing research per se.<br/><br/>Emotional investment is important, especially at our level. We work with small products, not commodities. We're not D&amp;D. We're selling ourselves as people, on the 'net.  Presenting a public face.  Social currency.<br/><br/>We talked about various ways of presenting yourself on forums. Two themes that emerged were consistency and authenticity. There's no point doing Smooth Sales Pitches for your game if you're completely argumentative when you talk about other stuff.  Your persona, and actual person, are part of the product in this way. <br/><br/><b>Acknowledging flaws</b><br/><br/>Identify and acknowledge the flaws in your game and in the way you present yourself online. Frame these flaws in a sympathetic way.<br/><br/>For example, the flaw in Grey Ranks is that it doesn't look like fun. You don't want to talk that down and you sure as hell don't want to spin it (people can smell spin a mile off).  This is something Jason acknowledges as being entirely accurate. <br/><br/>Instead, it needs to be addressed sympathetically. The story here is: Grey Ranks doesn't look like fun. But is it really not fun or just a different kind of fun? Is it rewarding in a different way?<br/><br/>There can be different fun, different play experiences, for different audiences. Paul suggests this pitch: "In a quick evening of play, this game will walk you through the experience of living the Polish resistance..."<br/><br/>Paul also suggests starting with a goal. Is it a commercial or an evangelic goal? Perhaps Grey Ranks is an evangelical goal-based game. Given that, how can it be measured? Media placement, awards, Actual Play reports? Goals must be metrics; they must be measurable.<br/><br/><b>More on Grey Ranks</b><br/><br/>Graham comments that he is not sure what the experience of play is like, even though he owns it. To which jason replies, "Ouch!"<br/><br/>Elizabeth says that she met Jason at GenCon, and expressed excitement for Grey Ranks; Jason (treating Elizabeth as a peer) then said that people were scared off by the game - regardless of his motivation, it caused her to walk away and not buy the game.<br/><br/><b>What's the pitch?</b><br/><br/>The moment of conversion - when somebody is looking for something "different" - takes place when it's clear that people are looking for something different. (This is a Grey Ranks-specific comment, I think)<br/><br/>Credibility - does this come from a reputable place?  Who the hell is Jason to talk about the plight of the Polish people? And yet Jason actually did a lot of research for the game, working closely with Polish people and museums, so perhaps that's worth pushing.<br/><br/>Part of the story is establishing my credibility - this applies to a "difficult" game like GR or SAJ, but also to Play Unsafe, which offers advice. <br/><br/>First point of contact / second point of contact<br/><br/>Every marketing effort is going to be first point of contact (naive potential customer) or second point of contact.<br/><br/>First contact ---&gt; conversion is the process.<br/><br/>Indie scene blogs assume a second point of contact, assuming high level of familiarity.  This is generally not true!  WTF people?<br/><br/>First contact - person is perhaps intrigued, then you need to have a goal.  Second contact is all about your goal.  Your goal, again, is something measurable, regardless of whether your goals are evangelistic or commercial.<br/><br/>Play goals as part of metric:<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8938" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8938</a><br/><br/><b>It's Complicated</b><br/><br/>What's the story?<br/>What's the game's flaw?  Form factor perhaps, 4.5" x 7", 40 pages long.  You want me to pay $16 for what?<br/><br/>Elizabeth used form factor as a selling point - a handy teaching text, portable, easy to pull out, lots of replay value<br/><br/>Form factor driven by cost in It's Complicated's case<br/><br/>Paul says:  The flaw is "It's a chick game".  The twist leading to unlikely outcomes seems interesting, though.  Fun party game?  That sounds cool.<br/><br/> "Wow!  This isn't like a roleplaying game!  It's like something somebody with no RPG experience would write" That's a cool piece of the story, if presented in the right way.  If presented in the wrong way it sounds very perjorative.<br/><br/><b>Play Unsafe</b><br/><br/>Why did it sell 700 copies?<br/><br/>Graham thinks that, partly, it's because people recommend it to their friends. It's heavily evangelized by buyers. From feedback, it seems to have moved beyond the Story Games crowd into people who play D&amp;D.  Jason - anecdotally, it seems to be given as a gift a lot, or people want their own copies.  Price point may be a factor, too.<br/><br/>The book is written in a practical way. It doesn't get caught up in indie politics, although identity politics play a part: some people don't want that guy on Story Games telling them how to play.<br/><br/>Graham knows that he's spiky and sarcastic online. This might not be a bad thing: Paul suggests that standing out might a useful thing to do. It helps that he's fairly consistent and authentic: he's not sarcastic in one thread and then smooth and salesy when talking about Play Unsafe.<br/><br/>Establishing your story - be different.  But not too different.<br/><br/><b>Audiences</b><br/><br/>Story Games is a very insular but intense community.  They are, by and large, the wrong people to be marketing to if your goal is commercial.<br/><br/>Do you do market research? <br/><br/>RPGnet is a huuuuge community of avid arguers but it is hard to break into.  Word of mouth is the most powerful transaction, though, so find and recruit fans of your work. <br/><br/><b>What do you do to support your customers?</b><br/><br/>    * Elizabeth customizes the transaction with personalized notes, a pain in the ass, not achieving many conversions (too much effort for the payoff)<br/>    * Graham's first thought is that he does nothing. But, actually, he sends notes to people who say nice things about Play Unsafe: for example, if someone supports Play Unsafe on RPG.NET, he'll drop them an email. He also emails playtesters, thanking them for their feedback, and establishing a relationship.<br/>    * Jason sends swag to his superfans, supports convention play, stays tight with playtesters, etc<br/><br/><br/>Keeping in touch with playtesters and reward them.<br/><br/>What do you do to encourage your audience to help you achieve your goals?<br/><br/>What kind of market research have you done?  (none) - this is important, even before setting goals. <br/><br/>Where am I going to find people who like the story I want to tell them?  One goal is to identify audiences.<br/><br/>Who absolutely DOES NOT WANT to hear your story.  Don't waste your time!  Identify them, purge them.  Do both sides a favor.<br/><br/><b>Peers &amp; Competitors</b><br/>How much competitive analysis do you do?<br/><br/>Elizabeth hires hitmen to kill her competitors. She laughs as their disembodied heads arrive at her door.<br/><br/>Long tail of predecessor games<br/><br/>Jason - when you lose a sale of GR, who or what do you lose it to?  Carry, SAJ, Polaris?  I can easily sell someone on the right game for them in person (and a spirit of mutualism drives this, because getting them the right game is the best choice for everybody, even if it isn't my game) but do I need to proactively differentiate my product from the peer/companion games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238151/#Comment_238151" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T09:30:49+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  9:30AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey.<br/><br/>Do you think that there might be a selection bias here? I may not be using the right term, but it seems like the approach to Grey Ranks and It's Complicated in framed negatively (what did they do wrong?), the approach to Play Unsafe is framed positively (what did Graham do right?) This seems to be largely based on  sales numbers.<br/><br/>Which I realize is important, but it's also contextual. Put Polaris next to Play Unsafe and It's Complicated and it looks like it's sold a lot of copies. More than Play Unsafe. So does Play Unsafe retroactively become a Bad Example, since it's not the top seller? Does Graham's attitude become a negative rather than a positive? On the one hand, that's the pattern here (top seller = all qualities good, low seller = all qualities bad). Likewise, do Polaris' weirdnesses (limited edition collectible run followed by unlimited edition, mutualistic advertising co-op, linguistically based mechanics, weird-ass black and white cover, cutesy edition naming) become pluses?<br/><br/>But then if we're comparing Polaris with, say, Dogs and Sorcerer, Polaris is at the bottom of the heap. Then do the things which were positive a second ago become negative? Why? The question isn't "how to get more sales relative to your neighbors" it's how to get more sales, period.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238153/#Comment_238153" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T09:37:44+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  9:37AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We were applying the same methodology to each example, but we didn't ask the same questions of each.

Especially one where basically everything you say is spiky and sarcastic, but your entourage of friends come in and do damage control, "Oh he's really nice in person", etc. At best, it's transparent and makes you look like a hypocrite to people who really know you. At worst, you're unselling people on your effort with every spiked barb. Eventually it works against you. You will get noticed, though.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239588/#Comment_239588" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T06:18:50+00:00" title="October 29, 2009  6:18AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2009 6:24AM by Graham.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes. Fair point. Having said that, we were talking more about being <i>yourself</i> online, not cultivating any sort of persona.<br/><br/>The question was whether one should try to be nice, unargumentative or smooth-selling. Paul's answer, as I understood it, was that you should be yourself. Be nice to people, of course, but people will see through a facade of niceness, especially if you're often spiky as well.<br/><br/>And, again as I remember Paul's advice, being slightly spiky isn't <i>necessarily</i> bad. If you <i>are</i> spiky online, don't suddenly try to turn into Mr Smooth Nice Guy when you sell your game, because everyone will see through it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239608/#Comment_239608" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T08:46:03+00:00" title="October 29, 2009  8:46AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><i>What comes first, the audience or the inspiration?</i></blockquote>\nHmm.  This kinda feels like a false dichotomy to me, but I'm trying to put my finger on it.<br/><br/>I guess for me there's a step early in the design process where I ask:  Hey, wait a minute -- if someone wants to play this game, why shouldn't they just hack FATE or PTA or GURPS or something into it?  Sometimes there's a good answer to that question, sometimes there isn't.<br/><br/>What I mean is that inspiration implies a void in the market, which implies an audience.  At least that's the way inspiration typically works for me.  I'm just a lazy guy by nature -- if I'm inspired toward some neat game idea, I'm just going to buy it if it's already implemented in any half-decent fashion.<br/><br/><br/>Still, before I get too harsh on this whole thing, I'm really happy to see the engagement of the marketing process this early on.  I get the feeling some people look at it as "Given that you've developed Your Product, it's time to start marketing" which is way way later than it needs to be.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
