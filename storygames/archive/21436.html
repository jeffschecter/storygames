So a 1st level Cleric can cast whatever 1st spells they know. A 2nd level Cleric could cast any 1st or 2nd level spells they know.<br/><br/>Upon casting the spell, they need to make a Saving Throw (not sure which Save category or if under Wisdom score). If the save is a success, the spell goes off and no HP is lost. If the Cleric fails, the cost is 1HP per level of the spell. So failing a save with a 1st level spell costs 1HP, 2nd is 2HP, 3rd is 3HP, and so on. *Thinking that failure also penalizes future saves equal to the level of the spell. <br/><br/>Recovering HP/Saving Throw takes 1 hour per level of the spell.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469136/#Comment_469136" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-20T12:51:26+00:00" title="January 20, 2018 12:51PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it in principle, but it seems far too generous, compared to how the cleric I should supposed to function normally.<br/><br/>For instance, having access to high level spells at about half the level you'd normally need will impact the game dramatically.

The particulars are entirely different due to the math being what it is, of course.<br/><br/>If I may, my suggestion for the particulars would be to make the HP damage potentially dangerous, particularly for high level spells. Like so:<br/><b>*</b> You can try for spells up to your level, but it's generally dangerous to try to cast up to your maximum: the cost for a successful casting is one hit point per spell level, while the cost for offending the god is 1d6 hit points per level. You can easily kill yourself even at 1st level by casting and failing your save.<br/><b>*</b> Save every time you cast, and have three possible results: a success is when you succeed on the save regardless of the piety penalty from previous castings; a fizzle is when you would have succeeded without the piety penalty. A divine offense is when you would have failed even without the piety penalty.<br/><b>*</b> Calculate a piety penalty to curb repeat casting: -1 to the casting save per spell level cast or offended for previously. (Fizzles don't increase the piety penalty.) The penalty can be removed at a temple (a ritual, costs like 100 gp per character level), directly forgiven by the deity, or meditated away: the character can pray for 10 minutes up to their level times per day to halve their accumulated piety penalty.<br/><b>*</b> Establish the opposite of piety penalty, a piety bonus that helps be successful in spellcasting. This is essentially divine ritual casting: +2 to the save for spending a full 10 minutes per spell level in casting, another +2 for using ritual implements and smoke and mirrors, whatever the god likes in their rituals, and so forth. Obviously you can also have a holy item that gives a permanent bonus, and other such things.<br/><b>*</b> The piety bonus improves the saving roll target number for the spellcasting, same as piety penalty lowers it, but it also reduces the deity offense chance by its value. So a character with the saving roll number 15, with piety penalty -2 and piety bonus +2 would roll against 15 to cast, would fizzle on 11-14 and would offend on 10-.<br/><b>*</b> Lastly, you need to be definite about the way a cleric dies or incapacitates when and if they lose all their HP to spellcasting. I myself rather like the idea that they don't die but merely faint; makes all this a bit less harsh. Perhaps a faint + a roll off a harsh spirit travel table; nothing like losing half your XP because a spirit leech encountered your defenseless body while the spirit was visiting their God [grin].<br/><br/>That may seem a bit complex, but there's a method to the madness: saving rolls are quite easy to fail, particularly at low levels, so any saving roll that takes regular penalties or bonuses will be rather volatile. Therefore it is important to give the player many tools for managing those risks. Allowing improving the save by carring a holy implement and other such hijinks will help characters actually cast a few times safely now and then.<br/><br/>Note that the way I set that suggested math up is that you're more likely to fizzle than backlash the more you cast. This is intentional. The combination of that plus the piety bonus idea should make it possible to discover a happy medium where a casting cleric who's not pushing their god's patience too much would have a low backlash chance (like, up to 15%) and high fizzling chance, rather than the other way around.<br/><br/>Ultimately my suggestion boils down mathematically to this: a spell should cost 1 HP per level regularly, but backlash should be 1d6 HP per spell level. This makes it so that a 1st level Cleric is actually risking their life by casting, and later on the same holds true for any Cleric that tries to cast up to their maximum potential. You want to encourage a more restrained casting profile: a mid-level cleric will stick with low-level spells for the most part to ensure that they'll survive the possible save failure backlash. Only in the most critical situations will a cleric risk dying of backlash.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469147/#Comment_469147" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-20T18:44:37+00:00" title="January 20, 2018  6:44PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, way too complicated for my tastes!<br/><br/>If I were going to link spells to HP -- and I'm loath to do so because of the death spiral it creates -- I'd add a middle-difficulty competency roll for each spell and only inflict damage on failure. <br/><br/>* 2d6 + caster level - spell level &gt; 8<br/>* If over 8, the difference is the number of hp you can heal someone as a free action<br/>* If under 8, the difference is the amount of damage you take<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469150/#Comment_469150" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-20T21:25:13+00:00" title="January 20, 2018  9:25PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2018 9:29PM by vgunn.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about this:<br/><br/>Cleric can cast any spell they know, equal or under their level.
