The premise is that he's a "professional" wet-worker that does the job mostly to help people manage how other's see them via short term memory destruction. I'm thinking the guy kind of hates his job but that wet-working is what he's good at. The concept I think is sound enough, but I have this weird desire to make the character work against himself. The most basic strategy for characters is to make everything support a few highly related tasks... your geneline, your experiences, your tech and interface all bumping one thing so that it underlines the characters core identity. So my question is:<br/><br/>How much does EFFECTIVE = FUN in Free Market<br/>How heavily do you have to support an activity, mechanically, to make it doable in game.<br/>Are there interesting ways to do self defeating builds that are still fun. By "self defeating" I'm thinking along the lines of playing a D&amp;D Fighter with low Str, something that an early editions complicated but didn't cripple your character.<br/><br/>Any help would be appreciated, plus any general heads up I could get would be nice as well.<br/><br/>As a PS... if either Jared or Luke could explain the "no animal people" thing to me it would be really appreciated. When I was reading the text (of the Beta) I couldn't help feel like that could have been left out, so that any given group would be free to add or subtract cat girls as they saw fit. Is there more to expressly excluding those kinds of characters than aesthetics?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306260/#Comment_306260" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T13:47:20+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  1:47PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, you're talking about a pretty standard FM character.<br/><br/>Effectiveness has no bearing on fun in FreeMarket.<br/>The range of effectiveness between different characters is tight. <br/>Give your character a geneline at odds with his experience -- or vice versa. <br/>Take tech than doesn't fit your idiom (but always use interface to support your current focus/profession).<br/><br/>Join a MRCZ that isn't about killing people.<br/>Start with memories that are about deathing shit. <br/>And take Wetwork experience and interface of at least 1 each.<br/>You'll create a character who wants to be one thing, but is very good at (and thus incentivized) to do something else.<br/><br/>And you can't play cat people in the game because you must play a human not a robot or animal. FreeMarket does not believe that consciousness can be transferred out of the body into another vessel and remain human. You can play a heavily modified human, but you cannot play a heavily modified animal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306262/#Comment_306262" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T13:58:34+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  1:58PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2010 1:59PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nolan,<br/><br/>Your ideas (and Luke's suggestions) all sound they could be like super fun complements to your character's MRCZ activities.  But without knowing what those MRCZ activities will be, it's hard to say.  <br/><br/>Beyond "not about killing people", you might advocate for a MRCZ that interacts strongly with whatever's interesting to you about hating wetwork.  Like, a "help people find their ideal jobs" MRCZ, or a "deathing insurance" MRCZ or something.<br/><br/>P.S.
