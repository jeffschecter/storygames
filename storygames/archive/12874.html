However, that will either make the system rather boring or change it fundamentally, and maybe you really want to play a certain system (what got me thinking about it was Millenium's End, but for the sake of everyone understanding I'll use D&amp;D as the example). I don't mind random generation at all, I don't even mind random effectiveness, what I do mind though is results completely opposite to my character concept (which can also be ineffective results, my character concepts are always closer to hero than zero). There's one alternate D&amp;D stat rolling method that gives you 8d6, 7d6, 6d6, etc down to 3d6 to distribute across the 6 stats, which would generally lead to higher scores where you want them, but it's always keep the best 3, so it's feasible that you'd land an 18 on the score you assigned 3d6 to and a 13 on the one you assigned 8d6 to (not to that extreme, but that kind of thing happens more often than not, as is the nature of random numbers). If I've got a character concept of a charismatic and intelligent person, and I get rather average in both, but end up really strong instead, what's the point?<br/><br/>So, what I liked with the FASA Star Trek system was you get certain starting points, and options to roll 1d10 on an individual basis and add them to your skill score. If you have 8d10 to allocate in a certain phase of character generation, you would allocate the first d10, roll, see what it is, and then decide where to allocate the next one, so if you roll a 1, you can fix that by rolling again and get what you want higher a bit higher.<br/><br/>So to apply this to D&amp;D stat generation, you get 18d6 to roll, but you roll 1d6 each time, and put it into a score. This is always problematic to do without actually playing a game, as I find characters that are fine for testing a system become unacceptable for actual play, but I'll try anyway to just show what I mean.<br/><br/>Concept is a charismatic and intelligent thief. Using BD&amp;D stat progression, so there isn't the need for high scores, a 13 is just fine (I figure a +1 means you can use the stat name as an adjective to describe it, and +2 means very charismatic/intelligent).<br/><br/>First Die - Charisma: 6<br/>Second Die - Intelligence: 3<br/>Third Die - Dexterity: 6<br/>Fourth Die - Intelligence: 1 (4)<br/>Fifth Die - Intelligence: 6 (10)<br/>Sixth Die - Strength: 3<br/>Seventh Die - Constitution: 1<br/>Eighth Die - Constitution: 2 (3)<br/>Ninth Die - Wisdom: 6<br/>Tenth Die - Charisma: 5 (11)<br/>Eleventh Die - Dexterity: 2 (8)<br/>Twelfth Die - Dexterity: 4 (12)<br/>Thirteenth Die - Intelligence: 2 (12)<br/>Fourteenth Die - Charisma: 6 (17)<br/>Fifteenth Die - Constitution: 3 (6)<br/>Sixteenth Die - Strength: 5 (8)<br/>Seventeenth Die - Intelligence: 3 (15)<br/>Eighteenth Die - Wisdom: 6 (12)<br/><br/>Scores at the end:<br/><br/>Strength: 8 (-1)<br/>Wisdom: 12 (+0)<br/>Intelligence: 15 (+1)<br/>Dexterity: 12 (+0)<br/>Constitution: 6 (-1)<br/>Charisma: 17 (+2)<br/><br/>Those results are acceptable in my view, nothing terribly low (-1 is fine, more than that is pretty harsh), and the character concept of charismatic and intelligent thief is supported by the scores. Low strength and constitution fit reasonably well, but it was a matter of luck, whether it was those scores or wisdom. Course I did have more 6s than 1s, so luck was on my side there, but with 13+ being sufficient for charisma and intelligence I could have probably still nailed it with some lower rolls, although again it totally breaks down with a stream of 1s, and 1d6+9 times 6 might just be better.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290057/#Comment_290057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T15:28:04+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  3:28PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I read the title, I thought you meant building a character's initial stats while playing the game.<br/><br/>I like that idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290091/#Comment_290091" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T16:45:01+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  4:45PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's actually what HeroQuest does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290545/#Comment_290545" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T13:58:24+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  1:58PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is functionally identical (and mathematically <i>almost</i> identical) to a point buy system where points are purchased 1:1 and the pool of points is determined with a random die roll.

As you allocate each d6, come up with a phrase that relates to it.  Later, when you have to roll on that ability score, you can try to roll that number or lower on a d6 to get a +1 to your ability check if the phrase is appropriate to your action.  So, a roll of 1 would be an obscure/trivial phrase/relationship like that one time at band camp (only useful when trying to learn a new musical instrament and still not useful) while a roll of a 6 would be spending time at a magic acadamy for intense training (trying to learn a new 1st level spell as an archmage).  When you increase your ability scores, you decide which aspect/relationship to add a point to (max 6).  In this way, you have sets of aspects/relationships that explain your ability score and give appropriate bonuses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290923/#Comment_290923" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T13:34:54+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  1:34PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's brilliant!
