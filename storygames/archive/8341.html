They are all intelligent, thoughful and creative.  We are all good friends away from the table.<br/><br/>Recent experience with my group has me scratching my head with bemusement - imagine a big cartoony \u201c?!\u201d suspended above my cranium.  We had spent the better part of two years playing in Jeff\u2019s WFRP game, and after that wrapped up I pitched Burning Wheel to my group because a) I like it a lot and b) I thought it could work for my group.  I took great pains to explain the fundamental differences between BW and WFRP, especially the Intent, Let It Ride and BITs/Artha cycle concepts, and they all were enthusiastically on-board....<br/><br/>...until last Wednesday when we all talked and agreed that the game wasn\u2019t working for us.  From my perspective, the players didn\u2019t engage their characters\u2019 BITs and therefore did not fuel the Artha cycle.  Without that, BW grinds to a halt.  My players also didn\u2019t put a lot of effort into understanding the details of Task Resolution and said they found the mechanics clunky (I didn\u2019t).  Jeff stated that he felt that the designer of the game devised mechanics specifically to address problems that didn\u2019t exist with our group.  I found that to be an interesting observation.<br/><br/>So, having decided to boot the BW game we turned instead to Mongoose Traveller.  We turned the evening into a character creation session, and I immediately could see a change come over my group.  While playing BW, I sensed an undercurrent of frustration and a lack of genuine fun.  In contrast, just making characters for Traveller resulted in obvious enjoyment from everyone, even when they were just observing while another player made rolls for his term advancement.  They took special pleasure in the Connection rules, which let two PCs invent a connection between themselves whenever an Event occurs during a career term.  By the end of the session they had woven a very interesting and imaginative backstory tapestry for each of their characters.  Rock on.<br/><br/>Now, this is not intended to make any value judgements between Burning Wheel and Traveller.  However, I\u2019m left wondering exactly what happened to generate such a negative experience in the first case and such a positive experience in the second.  In Burning Wheel, the players are explicitly given a tremendous amount of agency with respect to their characters \u2013 using their BITs, the players have great power to push the game in whatever direction they want.  The more they push, the more they are rewarded.  But for whatever reason in my game the players did NOT push at all, despite the nudging and prodding I gave them.  And the game failed. <br/><br/>In Traveller, there is no such narrative mechanic similar to BW\u2019s Beliefs.  There is also no mechanic for rewards \u2013 no Artha points, no XP, nothing.  There is only in-game achievement.  The rules make no effort to provide any special agency to the players with regard to the story \u2013 on the contrary, character generation pretty much subjects the PCs to the fickle winds of fate.  So what do the players do?  THEY PUSH.  Off they go, inventing relationships to one another, fleshing out Enemies and Contacts, dropping ideas of possible story lines, etc.  All of the things for which Burning Wheel is specifically built.<br/><br/>I think I know why my group responded this way.  Burning Wheel is an example of System In The Fore:  the mechanics are right up front and indispensable to the game.  Everything one does engages the system, often in very obvious and structured ways (e.g. Duel of Wits).  Traveller, on the other hand, is an example of System In The Background:  the system is there, but only comes into play when invoked.   For some reason, the character-driven play style that I thought would happen with Burning Wheel is instead happening with Traveller, which is not at all what I expected.<br/><br/>Still scratching my head.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184301/#Comment_184301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T14:53:24+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  2:53PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Watch and see how much of that stuff from pre-play actually makes it into play.

Another major difference between BW and Traveleller:  the former gives one complete control over one's lifepaths, relationships, associations and reputations while the latter gives one very limited control.  During character generation in Traveller there is a significant likelihood that your character will be shunted off onto an unexpected path. Case in point:  the character that specifically aimed for a Pilot failed to enlist in the Navy and got drafted into the Marines.  Another character in the Navy set out to be on the bridge but ended up earning glory in the Engineering section repelling boarders.  A third got drafted into the Army, got kicked out, became a criminal, and finally wound up as a Law Enforcement agent.  Only one, the Scout, spent his entire career according to plan.<br/><br/>I think that for my group the randomness of character generation struck a very positive nerve.  The table was cheering when the Scout survived his seventh straight term!  There was a high degree of engagement with the process, and a lot of creative effort expended to weave an interesting tale of how these four people came to team up.  Maybe surrendering to the whims of character generation fate was just a welcome change from the total-control point-buy scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184622/#Comment_184622" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T12:09:07+00:00" title="December 22, 2008 12:09PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>It's possible that they were much more enthusiastic about you GM'ing and/or giving a game a try that you were advocating, and not actually invested in the game and its mechanics upon reading it on their own.

Right up front, I took great pains to explain how BW was different and how it would require a different approach that WFRP.  I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thought</span> that the buy-in from my players was for BW, but it could just be what you say:  our past games had been great fun, so perhaps they were just signing on for anything and trusting me to make it work.  <br/><br/>I suspect that not everyone read the rules with great detail, which for such a front-loaded learning-curve game like BW this can lead to difficulty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184623/#Comment_184623" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T12:14:53+00:00" title="December 22, 2008 12:14PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: manatic</cite><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>Could it be a setting problem rather than a system problem?

My players commented that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> of the systems (to them) had this effect, of disrupting immersion and the natural flow of the game.  Oddly, when I ran a demo of "The Sword" at a recent GoPlay event here in Portland (see:  Burning Portland - Wheel Edition thread) I had exactly the opposite experience.  I'm still excited to run BW, but I think the game is tailored for a different mind set than that of my regular game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
