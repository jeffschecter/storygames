When I say "pulled it out", here's what I mean - I laboriously assembled the mountain of small parts and fiddly bits the game requires.  Dice in specific colors and quantities, poker chips (two colors), paper clips (no color specified), index cards, glass beads (we used pennies), bits of paper you get to cut out and attach to other bits of paper.  I guess once you laminated the character sheet bits and put the rest in a dedicated Danger Bucket, you could genuinely pick up and play.  And you'd want to, because when dice hit the table it is rockin'.<br/><br/>I read the rules on my bus ride home.  That was my only exposure to the game.<br/><br/>We had three players - Joel, Steve, and Robo.  They played, respectively, the Psychic Professor Dr. Dynamo, the Atomic Daredevil Jack Brass, and the Robot Commando Logic Gate.  They went around and assigned roles and types to each other, which was fun.  Making characters was very fast and easy.<br/><br/>As GM my job could not be easier.  I listened to their "previously on", which introduced The Duplicatrix, Crime Queen of Rocket City, who had kidnapped Dr. Dynamo's neice and nephew.  Also, we saw Logic Gate's mysterious creator in silhouette.  There was also something about a sky castle, but that didn't get used.  I kicked things off with a crime in progress - some air pirates were hijacking the Herschel, a gigantic cargo magna-zeppelin, for their own nefarious purposes (it was clear they were going to ram it into Rocket City's atmosphere plant), viz:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/junk/scene_1_early.jpg"/><br/>So they dove in and the game utterly supports the kind of play it talks about.  The Daredevil wrecked their getaway car, but I created a threat where the debris was going to hit a school.  The Robot had to do something to re-route some tubes in the deadly gamma vapor chamber, and the Psychic dude accidentally opened the cages of the dangerous animals from Ganymede that were the Herschel's cargo.  Danger created threats.  I got to author crazy alien animals, sky mines, it was awesome.  THe only hitch came when one guy wanted to do some stuff unrelated to existing threats - in hindsight I should have just let him narrate as color, but at the time I was a little confused and shoehorned his narration into relating to an existing threat.  Later on:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/junk/scene_1_late.jpg"/><br/>After resolving this complicated situation, they had some interludes.  We learned about the hidden transponder (danger I had added), and how it looked like it was made by the person who built Logic Gate.   Steve casually mentioned that he was taking his beautiful girlfriend to the gravity ballet, and I ran with that - the next action scene took place at the gravity ballet benefit for Rocket City General Hospital.  It introduced the Duplicatrix, who had bombs (on in-game round timers) attached to the floating niece and nephew of Dr. Dynamo.  There was also a crowd in panic, three versions of the Duplicatrix, and a special challenge for Logic Gate, who realized that the Duplicatrix was his mother/creator.  The whole encounter was her demand to "get back her robot son from the insidious Danger Patrol":<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/junk/scene_2_early.jpg"/><br/>This went gonzo fast, now that everybody had a handle on the rules.  The round timers work wonders.  I put the Duplicatrices between the heroes and the kids, and poor Logic Gate had to churn through his own confusion before he could act.  At one point I had enough threat to create a disaster, which I gleefully did - Dr. Dynamo mitigated it, and I decided his new major threat was being pulled into the fifth dimension with the final Duplicatrix. <br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/junk/scene_2_late.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217416/#Comment_217416" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T05:01:05+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  5:01AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2009 5:07AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We instantly house ruled danger dice into "You're not asking - I'm telling."  If I as GM or the other players had a good idea for extra danger, we could add it to any action, rather than waiting for the player to request it.  <br/><br/>One guy, who is a more thoughtful and deliberative player, had a harder time coming up with stuff at the rapid pace the game requires.  It rewards a frenetic play style very heavily.<br/><br/>One guy was thrown by the fact that you can't really fail.<br/><br/>Three players seems <i>perfect</i>.<br/><br/>Once I got my sea legs, I really saw the power of non-obvious threats - I introduced Natasha Potemkin (hey, I didn't name her), prima gravity ballerina, as a threat, and had her latch onto Jack Brass, much to his girlfriend's disgust.  I added danger indicating a past relationship between Dr. Dynamo and the Duplicatrix.  I had Logic Gate get in brain-war with his own self doubt.  Really fun.<br/><br/>The game plays great - it was fast and exciting, a little ridiculous, everybody was angling for more and more danger. <br/><br/>I wanted more guidance or structure on how to organize threats.  I didn't really know how tough to make them when I authored new ones.  It seemed very fuzzy, maybe on purpose, but some boundaries or detailed examples would be great.  I'd love to see a massive, 12-point threat that was integrated with some timer threats and buffer minions - a super boss.  I'm just not sure how you'd implement something like that in a fun way that wouldn't be a grind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217431/#Comment_217431" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T06:56:19+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  6:56AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds a lot like my experience last night.

I think I would rather see a 1-1 rollover benefit than half the dice.

In this case, maybe that's sorta boring, because it is identical to taking a regular action.  So take a regular action and tack "helping" onto it.  Yawn.  Maybe it's essentially a regular action in which all the danger goes to the person you are helping.  Or you get theirs, or something.<br/><br/>I think we tended to race through setting up action prior to the die rolling, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217457/#Comment_217457" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T08:18:03+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  8:18AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, for helping, yeah it might be cool if they got your hits but you took their danger.

The photos are great, too.<br/><br/>I'm nodding along to everything. Helping needs work for sure. The character sheets and cards are still not perfect. I also think a stack of 48 character sheets is cool (and will be posting that PDF later tonight probably). Jonathan's "write in your Role stuff" method might be good, too.<br/><br/>I think the ritual of taking and giving danger dice will be a thing that each group customizes. Which one ultimately goes in the text is still up in the air (maybe all of them). I think starting with a power token is key, but maybe that's just me. Having to earn the first one makes perfect sense, too.<br/><br/>Guidelines for setting up threats: YES. They are sorely needed. I think the text currently says to make the new threat one level lower than the one that spawned it? Yeah. I really need to make some comprehensive examples, though.

If the rules don't already deal with that, this seems like a simple enough method.<br/><br/>3) Like some others have said, I was disappointed at first that I didn't have *all* the powers on my sheet.  I can see why not, of course, but if at some point you're looking to make character sheets simpler, you might just let players write in their choices from a list, rather than present everything at once.  There's a touch of information overload, which might explain why some folks missed their role-based special equipment in other games.<br/><br/>4) As Jason said, one of our players has a special place in his heart for failure, and was visibly crushed when he realized that it wasn't possible in this game.  I'd imagine that's not a problem for most folks, but it's worth noting that this game is all about winning, or maybe "winning in just a minute, after I finish punching this space-gorilla in the face."<br/><br/>5) I agree with what someone said in another thread- leading off the game with some character interactions and setting introduction before the face-punching would help some folks get their hands around the game before it took off.  I had a bit of trouble getting my brain in gear during character creation, but that may have just been our lack of preparation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217530/#Comment_217530" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T12:22:53+00:00" title="July  9, 2009 12:22PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>one of our players has a special place in his heart for failure, and was visibly crushed when he realized that it wasn't possible in this game.

Basically, while you can always make things harder in DP, you *will* eventually succeed.  It's kind of hard for me to explain "playing to failure" because I don't usually do it.  I suppose it's a kind of schadenfreude or something...<br/><br/>I guess the GM could set up a disaster which nobody steps up to mitigate, which would be a kind of collective failure.  The bombs go off, the Rocket City Ballet Company and little Billy are vaporized and the Danger Patrol stood by and watched. But that's not really the tone the game is designed for.  I suppose if someone wants to fail, they can go play Fiasco or something...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217549/#Comment_217549" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T14:36:18+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  2:36PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can a hero lose a conflict, end up captured and then go on to 'save the day'?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217551/#Comment_217551" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T14:47:10+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  2:47PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2009 2:47PM by John_Harper.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Steve.

The GM decides where hits go, based on the action, and splitting them between a couple threats is fine.<br/><br/>3) Yeah, I hear ya on information overload. It's something I'm working on.
