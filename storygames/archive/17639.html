I found it satisfied my gamer ADD quite better (can play new games all the time) and worked well with our rotating members never knew who would show up.<br/><br/>I was in a local gaming store yesterday picking up some deck boxes to sort my Netrunner decks and saw Fiasco sitting there on the shelf for only $13.  I had avoided picking it up when it came out because the subject matter didn't really interest me (despite being an enormous Coen brothers fan).<br/><br/>For $13 I couldn't help it.  And now I'm thinking about getting some members of my group together to play this and things like Bangs, Kickers, Story Now, have returned from that hazy part of the back of my brain - hurtling the marching armies of Eclipse, Space Alert, and Chaos in the Old World.<br/><br/>No real point to this post yet I couldn't help but share.                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399553/#Comment_399553" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T12:10:00+00:00" title="December  4, 2012 12:10PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a couple wane periods where I've drifted away from gaming for 4-6 months, in that time only playing 1 or 2 stand-alone sessions.

Do tell.<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, kind of.  I've gamed weekly with my younger brother for nearly 15 years.  Another member of our group has been around for 10 years.  Everyone else has come and gone and come back again due to life/other interests/etc.<br/><br/>I was running a weekly game from like 99-2011 without missing a week.  Occassionally we'd play a boardgame depending on the mood but our current campaign was our main focus.<br/><br/>We evolved as a group.  I found the Forge, was freshly jazzed and felt like a little kid again preparing his first GM session.  Started introducing bangs and stuff into traditional games and then we moved onto story games.  I guided the group into Indie-RPGs and they were fully willing, loving all of the new games we played.<br/><br/>Somewhere down the line in the last few years, a couple members of the group started having diverging interests.  They weren't looking for as serious of a campaign as I was, they thought it was a lot of work emotionally and mentally to be tied up in a heavy story like that.  They all the sudden wanted to just kill shit and take their stuff or just play a board game.  We gradually started floating towards board games and never looked back.<br/><br/>Board games made sense as I have gamer ADD and was always finding that cool new story-game that I wanted to abandon our current campaign and try the new one out (damn this forum).  They also support rotating player bases (including 1v1) better than the majority of RPGs.  No more worrying about scheduling.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
