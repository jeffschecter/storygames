(Because I'm all intertextual like that.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>Even the most traditional sim-driven RPG is freaking radical in artistic terms.  An RPG is a tearing down of every traditional understanding of how art is produced, how the author and audience relate to the text, and everything else that western art theory has constructed for centuries.  Instead of one artist passing art down to the audience, you have an inverted cyclical pattern where the artist and audience are one and the same, and everything else we know about art is up for grabs.  Creating even a thoroughly normal D&amp;D game is an exercise in identifying and deconstructing genre tropes from every action movie and fantasy novel anyone in the group has ever read.<br/><br/>RPGs have broken down the fourth wall, kidnapped the audience and dragged them up on stage.</blockquote>\nBenlehman said something similar, which I also agree with.<br/><br/>Here's the thing: RPGs are the primary way in which I relate to texts!  To stories!  In other words, to <i>damn near everything</i>.  (Except, in a way, music, because it's another art form that I actually know about and that doesn't map as easily to RPGs.)  But certainly to the nerd media I love, like LotR, Dune, Star Wars, Battlestar, etc.  Even non-nerd media is now susceptible thanks to non-genre games like Grey Ranks and whatnot.<br/><br/>So, even though I love discussing those things when I meet a fellow enthusiast for, say, the novel "The Master and Margarita," at a certain point, if that person isn't also a roleplayer, I have trouble continuing to discuss that text with him or her.  There's a certain thing there that they just don't quite "get," most of the time.<br/><br/>In other words, hallelujah, I fucking get it, finally.<br/><br/>In fact, I'm going to go farther: I think the fundamental divide in RPGs can be looked at (paradigmatized?) as not between trad and indie, but between people like me, for whom RPGs are the main way in which they relate to text (I will call us Crazy People), and people for whom it's just one of a number of hobbies and who aren't really into RPGs sufficiently for RPGs to warp their viewpoint as completely as they have warped mine.<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234954/#Comment_234954" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T20:50:05+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  8:50PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2009 8:55PM by jason.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I finally got Netflix, and queued up the geeky classics I never saw. I've gotten to the end of season 3 of the new Battlestar Galactica tonight, and I've got Firefly queued for when I finish this. But watching Galactica, I can't help but think, "Oops, Lee Adama failed his Piloting roll, now the GM is introducing a Cylon Twist!"<br/><br/>In his <a href="http://thefifthworldsg.blogspot.com/2009/09/future-of-science-fiction.html" rel="nofollow">introduction to <em>Future Primitive</em></a>, an anthology of ecotopian fiction (I really only liked the first few stories, though), Kim Stanley Robinson calls science fiction "a mode of thought that is utopian in its very operating principle, for it assumes that differences in our actions now will lead to real and somewhat predictable consequences later on\u2014which means that what we do now matters."<br/><br/>I think RPG's take that utopian view even farther. For most people, you couldn't come up with a more static thing than a story. What do we say, when we mean that we have no control over a situation? "It's scripted." "It is written." People who play games, especially tabletop games (because, let's face it, video games cheat\u2014they don't provide real interactivity most of the time, just a shallow imitation of it), have experienced a different kind of story. For us, stories invite us to engage them actively, rather than simply receive them passively. It gives us the idea that we can change things.<br/><br/>I don't think this makes us "superior." It may just mean we've got a misguided, utopian, hopelessly na\xefve view of the world. But I do find people who don't play games that I can relate to like this. But those people <em>do</em> occupy themselves with some other kind of active, participatory art. And yes, other examples don't occur too often. Our world favors the passive consumption of art as a commodity. But I do think that whether you engage the art in your life actively or passively will shape the way you see the world.<br/><br/>As for music, I've found one of the strongest parallels there: in informal jams, and jazz music.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234956/#Comment_234956" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T22:53:37+00:00" title="September 30, 2009 10:53PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2009 10:53PM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>In fact, I'm going to go farther: I think the fundamental divide in RPGs can be looked at (paradigmatized?) as not between trad and indie, but between people like me, for whom RPGs are the main way in which they relate to text (I will call us Crazy People), and people for whom it's just one of a number of hobbies and who aren't really into RPGs sufficiently for RPGs to warp their viewpoint as completely as they have warped mine.</blockquote>\nHowever, remember that the traditional viewpoint of a gamer towards story was for a long time the same as for other people.

Of course what you do in a video game affects the story. Sometimes there are even different endings. Just like choose-your-own-adventure books. This is, in my view, a far cry from the kind of in-the-moment story creation of modern story games. In PTA, the story is up for grabs. In a typical railroaded Eon (Swedish game. Sorry, I never played D&amp;D) game, it is not. You can grab parts of it and change their color, but the story itself is trasmitted from the GM to the players.<br/><br/>In fact, even when the GM is totally improvising, riffing off the players' actions, if the players aren't playing with the goal of creating story, I'd say story creation is still a one-way street.<br/><br/>Hm.

I've been training for years and years and I instruct and read books and newsletters about it. A lot of my time goes into thinking about martial arts.

Story games will affect your view on stories and when discussing things in which stories play a prominent part, you will have a different perspective, which can lead to a certain amount of disconnect.

It isn't. Discussing everything in terms of RPGs has the potential for you to miss things that don't translate in RPGs. Of course, this is your prerogative.

Awesome.<br><br>Lord Minx: I *think* what I'm getting at goes something like this: at this point, I'm a sufficiently experienced roleplayer/storygamer that the ethical themes of almost any text I encounter are relatable to some RPG experience I've had.  And my RPG experiences are very important to me, have had a lot of impact on me, and quite frankly are a reasonably core part of my identity.  Conversely, almost any text I encounter that influences me sufficiently\u2014 BSG, The Master and Margarita, Notes From Underground, certain Dylan songs, *whatever*\u2014are going to creep into my roleplaying, albeit usually in some subtle, hard-to-pin-down way.  This then makes for a feedback loop going back and forth between RPGs and other texts.<br><br>Graham: It's sort of a weird example I threw out there.  I'm actually quite accomplished at discussing novels qua novels.  I have an undergrad degree in French Lit and wrote lots of good papers that didn't touch on RPG stuff at all.  But I don't fundamentally enjoy that level of analysis as much I enjoy the RPG-relating analysis.  It frankly just doesn't seem as meaningful.  (See my paragraph on interiority, below.)<br><br>Wanderer: Ron Edwards often likens storygaming play to a jazz group jamming.  I'm not a particularly accomplished musician, and certainly not in jazz improv, though I have studied it a fair amount.  I think comparing the two works well as an analogy, but the specific skills are pretty different.  Mainly it's just that music as itself isn't really relatable to RPGs in the way that, say, books, movies, and TV shows are.  So music is more-or-less immune to my "I can't talk about this with you unless you're a gamer" thing.<br><br/>Mark W: As to whether or not this effect is unique to RPGs: it's not unique in the sense that discussing something with a fellow fan or cognoscenti of that subject is *always* going to be different than discussing that thing with someone whose<br/><br/>And you're probably right that I'm overstating my case in that I also have trouble talking about music with non-specialists beyond a certain relatively superficial level.  But RPGs relate outwards a lot more than most other creative arts, in my opinion and my experience.  And that's because of their uniquely intersubjective, intertextual, postmodern yaya.<br/><br/>It's not about superiority, it's about <i>interiority</i>.  Playing RPGs allows us not only to create our own stories, but to internalize the experiences of people different from ourselves\u2014in many cases, very different from ourselves, and in other cases, people who deliberately share certain features with us.  To make decisions\u2014real ones, from the fiction's point of view, at least in a good game\u2014in their shoes.<br/><br/>And you're *definitely* right that it's about the consumer versus producer relationship in art.  I enjoy the latter much, much more, in all art forms.  I play RPGs and I write music, what more do I need?  In this view, everything else\u2014all the books I read, music I hear, etc.\u2014is just fuel for my engine(s).  Which is fine, really, since that fuel is the product of other people's creative engines.<br/><br/>Thunder God: Hmm, I don't think it's accurate to say that I judge all media by the same criteria that I just RPGs.  I mean, that would be absurd.  "Boy, that book's resolution mechanic was totally unbalanced!"  It's just that my experiences of being an RPGer inform all my criticism of other stories.  See Simon P's comment.<br/><br/>Simon P: Yeah, you've got it.  I'm talking about RPGs/storygames, an activity which fundamentally shapes one's view of *stories as a whole*.  blankshield, you too.<br/><br/>Oh, final thought, re deconstructions and RPGs: the great thing about RPGs is that unlike most other postmodern art forms, they don't inherently suck and aren't pretentious.<br/><br/>Matt                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235148/#Comment_235148" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T23:03:29+00:00" title="October  1, 2009 11:03PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I want to know how you'd do<i>The Master and Margarita</i>as a game.</blockquote>\nOh, good question.

Like I might create a setting where there is a sort of cold, unfeeling, state / God-figure, with a contrasting Satan figure who offers creativity and truth, but at the possible cost of sanity.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235151/#Comment_235151" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T23:44:59+00:00" title="October  1, 2009 11:44PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>ie, if I were watching Star Trek and it got me thinking about gaming, it'd be "I wonder how I could make a system that made people feel like they were zapping evil aliens and doing crazy stuff with main reflector dishes?" and not "Oh man, I can't believe Data botched his perception roll three times before he noticed they were stuck in a time loop."</blockquote>\nThis.
