(There was a really jarring panel where his avatar went from normal sketchy mode to highly detailed mode, and the change felt very real!)<br/><br/>MMO's like World of Warcraft clearly have stuff down of using highly detailed stuff to draw you in; but the alternate route is having abstract images or a lack thereof to get you to project and empathize with your character. So how about D&amp;D minis then? If you have very specific-looking minis, will that help you get more or less into caring about what's going on in the game?<br/><br/>And then there's the trailers of D&amp;D 4th ed. The gameboard, correctly, isn't a whole game in itself - it's just the pieces you move around to represent yourself in play. It's less detailed than an MMO, which isn't an oversight - it should rightly be seen as a feature. On the other hand, is it still <i>too</i> detailed?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89826/#Comment_89826" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T12:19:22+00:00" title="August 23, 2007 12:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>MMO's like World of Warcraft clearly have stuff down of using highly detailed stuff to draw you in</blockquote>\nThat's funny, because up until this point I was certain your post made the opposite claim - that MMOs like WoW are more successful than its competitors because their avatars are purposely not very detailed or realistic, instead opting for highly stylized models. Other MMOs, and single-player games too for that matter, that aim for more photo-realism tend to suffer from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" rel="nofollow">Uncanny Valley effect</a> much more than WoW.<br/><br/>And while I agree with the general hypothesis, I think it's definitely a bell curve rather than a linear relationship. I certainly never feel as close an attachment to my character in a text-based MUD as I do playing a graphical MMO. A lot of my character attachment in MMOs come down to customizability, too - a typical Korean MMO with a slim selection of pre-rendered, static but beautiful characters set off far less of an emotional response than a more crude character that <b><i>I</i></b> built.<br/><br/>How this relates to miniature combat and D&amp;DI, I have to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89827/#Comment_89827" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T12:24:47+00:00" title="August 23, 2007 12:24PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2007 12:26PM by lachek.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, thought about it.<br/><br/>I think customizability plays a large part, again. If I could customize my "avatar" - i.e. mini - to have features of my character, I would feel a stronger connection with it. For example, if my character used a bow but the mini had a sword, it would be annoying. It would be less annoying, but still not great, if the mini wielded no weapon at all.<br/><br/>One form of customization is painting, and I think being able to paint / colourize (the latter applicable to D&amp;DI) the mini would be an attachment factor for me.<br/><br/>I imagine <i>Secret Life of Gingerbread Men</i> handles this phenomenally. I'll have to try that out some day.<br/><br/>EDIT: So, to answer your <i>question</i>, I don't actually think that fewer mini details would help my character attachment at all. However, the <i>wrong</i> mini details would break it (see bow/sword/nothing example above).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89854/#Comment_89854" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T13:16:00+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  1:16PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call. So in fact, the virtual minis will be easier to customize (just enough) to help the player get to that stronger connection. Whereas (unless you're doing the home paint + customization thing) store-bought minis are less mutable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
