First, some random thoughts: <br/><br/>1. People need to be willing to give something like this a go. If they aren't, the idea can die right here. <br/><br/>2. Some people need to be willing to make an upfront commitment to either participate or handle the various service aspects that such an event (promotion?) would require. For my part, I'd be willing to pay to register a domain name if and when this comes together (provided that my day job hasn't gone the way of the dodo by that time*). We'd need somebody to handle hosting, site maintenance (beyond my time contraints or abilities, I'm afraid), etc. <br/><br/>3. I really think that such an event should be officially associated with a known indie RPG retail outlet. Currently, this means IPR, RPGNow, or Your Games Now. That said, I <i>really</i> think that association with IPR would have the biggest and most beneficial impact on consumers as it seems to be a beacon for some of the negative perception voiced in the other discussion by way of perceived official association with the Forge (I use the word "perceived" here as I'm aware that such affiliation does not exist, though I also know that in the minds of many, the two entities may as well be Siamese twins). <br/><br/>4. When it comes to whom collaborates with whom, things get a bit sticky. Initially, I thought that assigning teams seemed like a good idea. In retrospect, this seems counter-productive as collaboration would essentially be forced, which undermines the whole concept. I think a pool of willing participant would be a better place to start. That said, choosing who one collaborates with by fiat presents its own issues, as somebody will ostensibly be "picked last" which also seems to undermine the concept (and will likely leave somebody feeling kind of shitty). Ideas? <br/><br/>5. One possible method of circumventing the above issues which occured to me, is allowing teams to be organized independently of event structure and then join after already formed. Kind of like local sports teams. A few guys and gals get together or rocket off some emails, decide to work together as The Odd Bedfellows (choosing a team name sounds like fun, no?) and signs up for event participation. <br/><br/>6. Regarding event structure, a specific start date and finish date seem necessary. And I'd hate to limit it to something that can only conceivably produce something half-assed. While something like 9 months or a year sounds excessive, I think that it might produce results that will really blow some people's socks off (i.e., sit up and take notice). <br/><br/>7. Completed projects absolutely need to published for commercial release in some form, with members of a given collaborative group splitting the proceeds amongst themselves or, perhaps more appropriately, pooling a percentage of the proceeds to support subsequent Soup of Ages competitions, making the event a self-supporting endeavor (and dividing the remaining proceeds amongst themselves). <br/><br/>8. There should probably be some kind of "big reveal" to make the finished products public. Ostensibly a web site announcement would suffice, though a con event or organized promotion on other hobby-related sites would do the event and the underlying goal of burying negative public perceptions much more justice, I think. <br/><br/>9. I realized that this is ostensibly an outreach operation for "Indie", despite the hallmarks of a more traditional design competition. Some people will always have negative perceptions of the community, of course. That's their problem. That said, I think something like this would break down many of the negative perceptions that more reasonable people have and make them "feel a part" rather than "feel apart". In that sense, I think that only good will come of such an effort. <br/><br/>So. . . what are <i>your</i> thoughts?<br/><br/>*I work in the mortgage industry which, I'm certain you're aware, is suffering in the current economy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91617/#Comment_91617" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T08:19:29+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:19AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still thinking.

That is, I think that teams and projects should be probably be decided upon independently of the actual event, as it seems to be more sincere and, thus, in keeping with the purpose of such an event. The more I think about it, the more sense it makes. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Perhaps what you need is a matchmaking service to bridge people in various communities with similar design interests.<br/><br/>"I want to write a game about dragons ...<i>and magic!"</i><br/><br/>"Me too!"</blockquote>\nA dedicated 'coming together' forum where creators can specifically discuss project proposals and 'grow' teams for such an event sounds like a good idea. I could host something like that over at Miscellaneous Debris (it's a theory-neutral site, which affiliates itself with no one school of thought in regard to game design). Alternately, given James's blessing, I could wield my awesome Admin powers at RPGHost to create such a sub-forum (perhaps getting OBS to act as a 'name only' sponsor for the actual event).

I want to do a tightly focused game to tell a very specific kind of story, e.g., Grey Ranks, Roach, MLWM, Polaris, etc. And I will bring the no-nonsense "corporate sensibility" to the product. I want someone to show me how to let me freak flag fly, and I want to show that hippie that it's okay to take a shower every once in awhile.<br/><br/>I speak metaphorically, of course.<br/><br/>As for your mentioned project, that's very similar to what I've been working on with Bullseye. It's a multi-genre system that lets the players choose the "depletable resource" for the particular game. So, instead of hit points, the players might lose faith or sanity or time.

It was ahead of its time in 2004, but is slightly behind the curve with the publication of Star Wars Saga. I also think that with 4e looming the viability of a game with an OGL base has to be predicated on more than novelty ("This time your BAB is a skill!" and all that.) So I would be looking for someone to inject some vitality into the system. There are a few things that need to be at the heart of things, but the exact expression of it all within a system could go in many directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, I need a few setting details taken care of as well as a campaign setting and starting adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe caveat I have about this, though, is that it's a *full scale* project -- not the kind of thin that typically gets turned around for publication in 96 small format pages. Plus, experience with Aeternal Legends has shown me that for comprehensive development 3 full drafts is not out of the question.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll see about finding upload space for what I have. Conversely, I would like to see a writing sample from anyone interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93131/#Comment_93131" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T07:07:37+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  7:07AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I'm finding myself, having posted to this thread, in the position of feeling pressure to do a collaboration with somebody... even if I'm not interested.

And yet, there is absolutely no rush here. A week, a few months, a year later if the inspiration strikes and does not strike earlier, then go for it. Otherwise, do not be too worried.<br><br>I made it a sticky to keep it in the collective conscious for now. I don't imagine (and neither did James) that people would all jump on this right away and start collaborating right away.

I've been kicking the tires on an idea set in a world of city states that are separated by vast wastelands where characters play elementalists (mages whose powers are controlled by the four elements.)
