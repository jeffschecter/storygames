This fairy tale world is on the verge of serious social upheaval, as people prepare for the second coming of Seven Flames (the apocalypse bringer). The kids can do magic. The adults can't. Enter greed, hunger, dangerous promises, moral gray area and tough choices. Heart of Ashes is kids fantasy that challenges how we view kids and adults.</blockquote>\nHow you GM in Heart of Ashes:\n<blockquote>You select/create the situations and characters that interest you, and introduce them (as discrete units). If the players latch onto a given situation or character (by buying it as an Antagonistic Key), then you start complicating it - give them choices, challenge those choices, explore the ramifications of their actions, "gray" the moral ground. Create compelling situations where the question "what's the right thing?" gets superceded by "what are you going to do, right now?" Switch between ongoing situations using Shadows.</blockquote>\nOkay, so for Heart of Ashes I'm writing a number of modular situations/characters/monsters/factions. They are supposed to fit well together (ie, common tone) but operate independently (ie, a GM and play group can ignore 90% of the elements and have the remaining 10% still fly).<br/><br/>One idea I had, sparked by an Anthropology reading I had: a village is preparing for a harvest ritual, where a young girl will marry one of the village's ghosts.<br/><br/>Challenge: can you provide context? Why was she chosen? Does she want to marry the ghost? What does the ritual look like? Why during harvest? What do ghosts look like? Are they scary? What's the basis for this union?<br/><br/>I'm hoping to incorporate some cool ideas and in the end have: A Situation description (~paragraph), a Key (perhaps Key of the Ghost Wife, or Key of the Ghost Society), and a tiny stat block.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238424/#Comment_238424" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T14:22:34+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  2:22PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2009 2:22PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can legally marry a ghost <a href="http://www.legislation.cnav.fr/textes/lo/cciv/TLR-LO_CCIV_171.htm" rel="nofollow">in France</a>.<br/><br/>"Wonderful news!

How old is this tradition? how old do people think it is?<br/>Would she be expected to remain childless, or can ghosts get girls pregnant, or would she be expected to see someone on the side?<br/>Does her marriage to the ghost represent the young submitting to the past?<br/>Maybe its to ward off the winter chills to keep the frost from ruining the crops?<br/>Maybe she marries the ghost to keep them tied to land of the living, cause other wise death would pull them from the world at solstice, but being married confuses death.<br/>Maybe eventually the bride dies, in passion, or child birth, or from a wasting disease, and becomes the ghost of the next ritual.<br/>Maybe being pulled across worlds turns the couple into seers able to see the ending and beginning of things. They know the Oak with in the acorn, the war within the baby prince. The old widow in the young lover.<br/><br/>Ghosts are the spirits of the unquiet dead: those who are empty and hunger for that which they lack. They threaten to come back to the land of the living if they are not silenced. The longer an unquiet dead is allowed to remain unsilenced, the angrier and more powerful it can become, feeding upon its own discord. The only way to appease such a ghost is by the enacting of The Rite of Revenant Conjugality.<br/><br/>Here, the soul of a young person just come of age is married to that of his or her ghost-spouse. While the young bride or groom lives, they live in a twisted half-world betwixt life and death.<br/><br/>By day, their life is their own and they do as they please.<br/><br/>By night, while they slumber, their spirit joins with their husband or wife in the land of the dead.<br/><br/>Though they are free to do so, few living people will marry a Ghost-mate as their death is promised to their ghost-spouse.<br/><br/>The life of a Ghost-Mate is filled with strangeness. Their ghost-spouse often hovers around them during the day, trying to reach them, touch and talk to them. This can often lead to odd occurrences and sometimes, weird one sided conversations. Worse, sometimes the ghost-spouse can become dissatisfied and might seek to bring their living partner over to their side before their time...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238631/#Comment_238631" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-21T16:49:56+00:00" title="October 21, 2009  4:49PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Her family is opposed to the match.

Why was she chosen? Does she want to marry the ghost? What does the ritual look like? Why during harvest? What do ghosts look like? Are they scary? What's the basis for this union?<br/><br/><br/>...She was chosen because a) she has no realation to the ghost. It's a close-knit society, practically everyone is your cousin.<br/>b) the living family of the ghost think that that ghost would have liked her, despite their age difference- maybe this means that she is very subservient,<br/>maybe it means she is very confidant and capable.<br/>c) ...and because she has studied hard to learn the societal (largely ineffectual) ways of communicating with ghosts, mostly based on interpreting the movements that you can see out of the corner of your eye. <br/><br/>she wants to marry the ghost, despite a) that this particular person was not a kind man in life, and in fact was cruel to her specifically at one point when she was younger and he was alive (the ghost, before it died, was a man.) <br/>and despite b) the new butterfly feelings of crush attraction to one of the Player Characters (who are all children, to remind the reader; i would hazard that buying into this "scenario" with the ghost bride would mean that you want her to have a crush on you, and that your character has a crush on her, too.)<br/><br/>The ritual looks like a cute country christian wedding, with one side of the aisle for each family, some chairs have dark blue or brown cloth folded over the back of them to indicate that this is a chair left open for a ghost, that a ghost may even now be seated in it. The decor is in browns, yellows; lots of gourds. There is a small platform at the front,<br/>where the bride and, presumably, her husband stand.<br/><br/>it's during harvest because that's when plants are cut back, and the spirits have an easier time coming to the world of the living, which is handy for those ghosts who are<br/>fading out: older ghosts.<br/><br/>Ghosts are definitely dark smears that are seen at the edge of the eye. They are assumed to be the spirits of ancestors; they do all sorts of strange and terrifying things<br/>and are difficult to differentiate between. Ghosts also temporarily possess people whom they are ritual-bonded to, possess them in order to affect things in the human world.<br/><br/>The ghosts are scary. Not universally; sometimes individuals are not scary, but they are never comfortable. And those people who are comfortable with them are also kind of scary.<br/><br/>The family of the ghost (rather, those people who believe that this is their ancestor, if you want to add that level of unsurely and alien-ness) want to have more contact with their beloved, they are willing to have the ghost wife be a part of the family if they can use her as a conduit for communicating with their deceased.<br/>b) the ghost, whatever it is, will have access to the human world some of the time.<br/>c) the girl gains station and a bit of prestige, assuming the deceased was a powerful man in life (as that he wouldn't have a posthumous wedding otherwise)<br/><br/>little is known about ghost society, and ghosts can never speak directly to humans, only their actions can be interpreted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239207/#Comment_239207" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T15:24:02+00:00" title="October 26, 2009  3:24PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, all... I think I've nailed down the situation here.<br/><br/><b>The Ritual Of Ghost-Marriage</b><br/><i>Tags</i>: Horror, Village<br/><i>Type</i>: Situation<br/><i>Links</i>: [unsure at this point]<br/><br/>The story goes that this small village has been cursed by an otherworldly force, a horrible presence which seeks to consume the village every autumn. The only reason this village still stands is because a flock of ghosts stands guard over it, protecting it from fouler forces. The village elders have discerned what the ghosts wish for in return: that every year, a fair girl of the village be wed to one of the ghosts. Ghost-marriage is a gruesome process, which involves burying the young girl alive and performing the marriage rites above her freshly-packed grave. She dies, presumably travels to the ghosts, and the village is protected for another year.<br/><br/>Ellith has volunteered to be the sacrificial bride of this year's harvest festival. Her father is horrified that he might lose her, but her conviction is as strong as steel. He beseeches the PCs that they do something to dissuade her, for he has no sway anymore. If the PCs support the girl's decision, explore the dangerous effects this will have on the father's sanity (and subsequently, how he interacts with other villagers). If the PCs dissuade the girl, explore the possible reactions from the ghosts. If the PCs attempt to save the village from dark, otherworldly forces themselves (thus circumventing the ghosts and the marriage), then we've got an entirely different problem altogether!<br/><br/>Ant. Key:<br/><b>Key of the Sacrificial Bride</b><br/>Ellith is preparing to be killed during her ghost-marriage, at the Harvest Festival. She thinks this is the right thing to do.<br/>Gain XP whenever you argue with Ellith, her father, the priest or the ghosts over the ethics of this situation.<br/>Buy-off: Give Ellith your blessing. Alternately, prevent the wedding from occuring during the Festival.<br/><br/><b>If this is a shadow, and it falls...</b><br/>a.) Ellith "elopes". Her father blames you, and swears an oath of vengeance against you.<br/>b.) The ghosts are insulted, and call off the marriage (triggering a new Shadow: Otherworldly forces are descending upon this village.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
