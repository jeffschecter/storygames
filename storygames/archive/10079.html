Crossed swords, desperate chases at midnight, scathing social banter. And I just knew that the DitV resolution system would rock for this. But I didn't want to shoehorn the characters into some approximation of Dogs, trying to sort right from wrong.<br/><br/>So I took a chance, and jettisoned everything I didn't think I needed from the DitV rules: so no ceremony, demonic influences, pride/injustice/sin/etc.<br/><br/>I kept the character creation rules the same with the following exceptions:<br/><i>-We are "God's Watchdogs" becomes "We are the King's Musketeers and our duty is to defend King Louis XIII, France, and the Musketeers. Our sworn enemy are The Cardinal's Guards, commanded by the ominous Cardinal Richelieu."<br/>-Trait: "I'm a Dog" becomes "I'm a Musketeer"<br/>-Belonging: "Coat" becomes "Sword"<br/>-Encouraged Relationships with a mistress and a lackey<br/>-Initiation/Accomplishment became "How I came to be a Musketeer" and "What your character accomplished or learned"</i><br/><br/>Karen played <b>Henri (Heloise) d'Artois</b>, age 16 (18); a woman with a complicated history posing as a man to become a King's Musketeer. She had some great traits like "I'm a girl in a man's world" (2d8) and "I can snuff out a candlestick with my sword" (2d10). Her initiation scene was a barroom brawl to prove herself in a fight, and she gained the trait "There are many ways to win a fight".<br/><br/>Devin played <b>Claude Plumeau</b>, age 20; a well-rounded newly minted musketeer. He had traits like "I'm dumb enough to try it" (3d6) and "I have the heart of an ox" (1d8). His initiation scene was coming apon a group of bandits who were waylaying a carriage on the roads outside of Paris. After a tough fight he fought off the four bandits, and as he faded into unconciousness he saw the face of the woman in the carriage, his future mistress Sophie. <br/><br/>Chris P. played <b>Monsieur Gaston</b>, age 29; an older musketeer with a strong history and plenty of experience. He had relationships with TWO mistresses and a "Relationship with France" (1d6) because of his deep sense of duty. His initiation scene took place ten years before in a roadside tavern on a rainy night, as he defended the honor of the King from an insulting Englishman. He gained the trait "I throwdown for France".<br/><br/><i>[Skip ahead to "Thoughts on the Game" if you don't want to read the details of the adventure, as exciting as they are!]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223583/#Comment_223583" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-09T18:59:49+00:00" title="August  9, 2009  6:59PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Adventure</b><br/><br/>The Three Musketeers were tasked by their commander, Captain de Treville, to escort Eugenie de Charny, the young daughter of Comte de Charny, the King's Mapmaker (this comes into play later). She had some awesome traits like "Obey Me!" (2d8) and the Belonging "Cleavage" (2d8-Big &amp; High Quality).<br/><br/>They were to escort Eugenie to the fashionable ball of the season at Cardinal Richelieu's hotel in Paris. The Cardinal was away on State's business, but the party was sure to be teeming with his Guard's. And this was a masked ball, so the trio needed to keep both Eugenie and themselves out of trouble.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that was easier said than done. As soon as they walked in the door, Eugenie asked Gaston to get her leather case from the carriage the same time she dragged Henri out on the dance floor, both to try embarrassing him with his lack of fashionable dance moves, and to find her true love, Carlos Bazon.<br/><br/>And while Henri proved a talented dancer, Eugenie spotted her man and slipped off into the crowd around the same time that Claude spotted who appeared to be his mistress, Sophie de Roucy-Sissone, laughing and flirting with another man!<br/><br/>While this was happening, Gaston walked outside and found Eugenie's leather case, but while he was getting it out of the carriage, it opened up and the contents fell on the ground. He looked down to see a pair of riding boots, a traveling outfit and a scroll closed with the King's seal. "What mischief is this?" he tought, just as he was waylayed by a Lieutenant of the Cardinal's Guards, Danton de Porcein and one of his friends. Danton started to tease Gaston for carrying women's clothing, and suspecting that he was indeed a Musketeer, reached in to rip off Gaston's mask. And while Gaston choose to give by losing his mask, he did a sweet Matrix move to slip away before Danton could recognize him.<br/><br/>Back inside, It took another conflict for Henri and the cuckolded Claude to corner Eugenie with her lover, Carlos Bazon, young grandee of Spain. They were trying to get to the bottom of things when Eugenie saw Danton walking through the soiree crowd with the sealed scroll that he had found on the ground outside. And she started to rip past Henri to chase after the Cardinal's Guard.<br/><br/>Henri ran into Eugenie at the back exit from the ballroom into the Cardinal's dimly lit gardens. Eugenie pleaded on her honor for Henri to go after Danton and the scroll. But the Musketeer had had enough of the ingenue's troublemaking, and refused. So that left Eugenie to run after Danton, clawing at his face to get the paper as if it was a matter of life and death. He simply pushed the girl roughly to the ground.<br/><br/>At this point, Gaston had not wanted to step back into the party, as he was now wearing the only mask he could find in the carriage, a frilly one made for a woman. So he slunk back into the garden's to access the party from a dark place.<br/><br/>And as Claude decided that Henri had the blond wildcat well in hand (for the moment), he went off in search of his beloved Sophie, only to find her on a back terrace. In the arms of the bandit he chased away from the carriage that bright day, Maurice "The Rat"! <br/><br/>Claude's blood boiled as he ran towards Maurice. Maurice pulled his sword and cut open Claude's side as the two tumbled over the balcony and into the garden. Maurice then attempted to skewer Claude, who was stuck in a rose bush but painfully got out in time. Claude was finally able to use his ox-like strength to overcome Claude, but his fallout rolls were high and he was badly wounded and in danger of dying. So Gaston arrived in the middle of time and tried to save Claude's life.<br/><br/>All this time, Henri laughed at Eugenie's comeuppance, but needed to defend her honor and charged Danton, sword in hand. The two actually got into a great duel, using thrusts and parries. Danton tried to topple a stone bust of King Louis onto Henri, who ducked cleanly out of the way. After several more strikes, another Cardinal's Guard charged Henri, who in desperation grabbed a flaming torch with his offhand. But the flames set Henri's clothes on fire, and he was forced to put his clothes out in a fountain and then knock it over on Danton. Danton avoided the fountain falling on his, but then took a step forward and slipped on the water, terribly wounded and bleeding.<br/><br/>And Henri was wounded pretty bad too, and Gaston had to jump in again to try and heal Henri in time! Henri appropriately ended up gaining the trait "Im a Healer" (1d6).<br/><br/>So now the Three Musketeers had vanquished their enemies, but they were attracting the attention of the party goers and the Cardinal's Guards, they were wounded, and they had lost both Eugenie and Carlos. But they did have the scroll. So Henri broke the King's seal and suddenly they were looking at a map of the French/Spanish frontier, with the locations of French forts marked clearly along with numbers of soldiers and supplies in each place. They returned to the Hotel de Treville to find their leader burning the midnight oil. After a quick conference (where they conveniently ignored the fact that they were the ones who opened the seal), he sent them back out to find the girl, and quick!<br/><br/>The group split up, and finally as dawn was breaking over Paris, Henri found the young Eugenie, crying by the side of the road just outside the city limits. She had escaped away with her Spanish lover, but when he heard that she lost the scroll, he pushed the poor girl out of her own carriage and made his escape alone. So Henri threw her over the rump of his horse and carted her back to the hotel.<br/><br/>Captain de Treville looked at Eugenie and then the secret map and was at a loss. Was this a matter of high treason? Or just the foolish failings of a young girl? Her father the King's Mapmaker probably didn't even know the map was missing. But as the responsible party, he could end up in chains or even beheaded because of this.<br/><br/>So de Treville walked over to a candle, burned the secret map, and ordered his Musketeers to deliver the troublesome Eugenie to a convent...well outside of Paris. He would explain all to Comte de Charny.<br/><br/>A capital ending to an exciting story!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223584/#Comment_223584" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-09T19:00:16+00:00" title="August  9, 2009  7:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Thoughts on the Game:</b><br/><br/>Honestly I didn't know how well this was going to play out. A friend had warned me that the system might fall apart, as without the sense of the Dog's being a town's arbitrators, the Sees and Raises wouldn't mean anything. And also that without the GM's dice for Demonic Possession, the characters could walk all over the NPCs.<br/><br/>But I pushed the characters to make decisions about their duty (to the King, France, their fellow Musketeers) vs. their honor (not to accept a slight to themselves or a lady). So there were some moral decisions that needed to be made. But they also made decisions out of love and spite, which was cool! I also did what I could to keep the characters apart, and pushed the hell out of them in conflicts.<br/><br/>It was challenging, but I kept the stakes as small as possible to encourage the characters to Give when they were behind. And they did in several circumstances, leading to some cool followup scenes.<br/><br/>The Fallout dice flew hot and heavy, especially the d8s from swordfighting!<br/><br/>In all, I thought it was a very cool experiment that worked better than I had hoped. And the played definitely wanted to wanted to play these Musketeers again. <br/><br/>So here's to trying something new.

After all, the king of France is ordained by God himself to rule this land, so his word is God's will.  Just because you have demonic influence doesn't mean you need demons to actually appear.  It just means you roll demonic influence whenever the musketeers are fighting people who are clearly acting against the monarchy, not merely petty scoundrels working for their own self-interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gamera_spinning" title="gamera_spinning"><img alt="gamera_spinning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/280/n8IY31021JMRT.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gamera_spinning">gamera_spinning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223593/#Comment_223593" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-09T21:37:39+00:00" title="August  9, 2009  9:37PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds fantastic!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223598/#Comment_223598" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T00:11:24+00:00" title="August 10, 2009 12:11AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2009 12:11AM by Wilhelm.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!

For the most part, the lack of just caused me to be more creative and aggressive during conflicts.<br/><br/>And the two conflicts when Gaston was trying to save each of the wounded musketeers were dramatic enough. Sure I could have used some extra dice on my side in the one three-way conflict involving two muskeeters. But we all agreed that those are a pain in a butt to resolve, so we would probably tend not to do those anyway and just rely on helping dice instead. I didn't really feel the conflicts were uneven. When they weren't life-threatening, both sides were comfortable Giving. And the several serious ones, both sides were throwing down to win.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Did you port over the "+d4" to swords, since they would be the cause of extra trouble in the settings, like guns in the original?</blockquote>\nNo, I decided to keep the +1d4 for guns, as those seemed more troublesome to a sword-using polite society. A huge black powder wheel lock horse pistol is going to cause some problems when you decide to fire it:) \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Did anyone use guns?  Did they still have d10s attached to them?</blockquote>\nNo one used guns as this adventure took place at the Cardinal's Hotel in Paris. But they would have had the d10 fallout attached to them in any event. But if circumstances take the musketeers to the provinces or on a military campaign, I'm sure we'll see some guns being used.<br/><br/>Given the fact that wounds in DitV can get worse, it was pretty hairy rolling 6 or 8 d8s for Fallout after a sword duel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223646/#Comment_223646" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T09:00:13+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  9:00AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing that impressed me about the game was the character arcs after we "Reflected" at the end of the adventure.<br/><br/>Gaston chose to leave the secret scroll behind to Danton so that he would not be uncovered as a Musketeer.

Duty vs. honor, indeed.<br/><br/>Henri chose to abandon honor (temporarily) when she refused initially to take the scroll from Danton, which led Eugenie to be roughly thrown to the ground. But then, Henri and Eugenie had had a lot of back and forth and had established quite a complicated history in just a few scenes.
