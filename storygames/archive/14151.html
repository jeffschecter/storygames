IaWA is like this as well, though you're limited to narrating about what your character does ...<br/><br/>Annalise &amp; Smallville: narrate whatever you want about your character but it stops at your character's skin - if you want to have an important effect outside your character, pull out the dice. (Smallville &amp; IaWA are both interesting in that you never have to accept someone else's narration about your character, you can always take a game-mechanical effect instead.)<br/><br/>Montsegur: narrate whatever you want, when you have narration rights, which can be taken from you - but once the player with narration rights puts something in the fiction, it's in there ...<br/><br/>Fiasco: spotlight character has final say (but is expected to abide by die color)<br/><br/>Geiger Counter: honestly, I'm not sure - it may be deliberately vague or I may have missed a sentence in there somewhere - when I've played, if there was a disagreement before a conflict we'd work it out until we had consensus or after a conflict played "whoever won the conflict gets to say" (but is expected to abide by condition) - I think we played this way more by instinct than by looking it up in the rules<br/><br/>(Correct me if I'm mis-characterizing any of these games.)<br/><br/>I've had fun with all of these, so, I have to ask ... does it matter where the game draws the line? What does it do to play? Do some of these styles not work for some players?

It looks like something is alive inside that asteroid'...")<br/>5) Invoking a threat ("The airlock starts activating by itself! The inner door shuts and the outer door is preparing to open!")<br/>6) Invoking traits, gear, or other fictional circumstances ("Maura tosses Jack a space suit and struggles to put one on herself!")<br/>7) Resolving the conflict after dice have been rolled ("Jack manages to get his suit on, but he loses consciousness just as he gets the seals closed")<br/>8) Ending the scene ("And.... cut.")<br/><br/>It's not really the case that you can narrate whatever you want, whenever you want.  There's a process you have to go through, and the kinds of things you can narrate are restricted by what "stage" of a scene or the overall game that you're in.  For another example, in Geiger Counter, the menace doesn't attack PCs until it has at least 2 dice to roll, it's just hinted at.  Or, in Mist-Robed Gate (another game you should look at), you can only hint at what you want before the blade has been uncovered.<br/><br/>Also, each time you narrate something, you're restricted by what you or someone else has narrated previously.  Like, above, when Maura's player introduces the idea that there are things living inside the asteroid, she's limited by the concept of Jack's printout of some readings. The new information she introduces has to be something her character could figure out by looking at some printed data.  And, if the contents of Jack's printout had been established in a previous scene (he was taking a geological survey of the asteroid, say), then the kinds of information she can introduce is limited further.  Likewise, if someone's character isn't in a scene, unless things change, they don't get to play their character in that scene.  That's a pretty big restriction!<br/><br/>So it definitely matters how games structure <b>the process of narration</b> as well as the issue of "who has authority to say what."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320986/#Comment_320986" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T13:57:36+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  1:57PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><br/>I've had fun with all of these, so, I have to ask ... does it matter where the game draws the line?

Cool.<br/><br/>Some things: <br/><br/>"Content" i.e the things we all know and accept about the setting, the characters, and the tone of the game, is the same as rules in terms of establishing who has credibility to say what when. "My character is a space-ship captain!" "We live in the under-earth!" - these things contribute to defining the scope of credible additions to the fiction. There's no rule in Montsegur about alien antennae, but the established setting and tone constrains and shapes the group's social interaction anyway, just like rules do.<br/><br/>Creative Agenda! It's a real thing! Imagine a game of chess where you're playing to win and I'm playing to put my pieces in pretty arrangements. It's the same situation as someone "sabotaging" Archipelago. They're playing by the rules, but they're not playing the same game. The game (all games?) is structured on the principle that the players are working toward a common goal.<br/><br/>Free play isn't free! Like all conversations, there are subtle rules structuring how we decide what enters into the fiction, and how we decide what to say next. I drew <a href="http://simoncarryer.blogspot.com/2010/05/thing-i-noticed.html" rel="nofollow">this diagram</a> a while ago, about how people decide what to say in games.

Sabotage implies malice, and you can't write rules to protect against that. If it isn't malicious, it is a pretty fundamental miscommunication that is taking place way above the rules level, related to expectations of play.<br/><br/>I'm using extreme examples there; there's a grey area between sabotage and not being in sync with the other players. <br/><br/>Games of Fiasco or Geiger Counter have gone too silly for me - I don't think it's a social issue, I think it's because the games lean towards the "once it's narrated it's in there" side of the dial.<br/><br/>Whereas my daughter will unintentionally ruin games of Archipelago by overusing TADW - <br/>Me: "Okay, so Hermoine is surrounded by three dark wizards - 'We have you now,' they say."<br/>Sofia (shaking): "Try a different way."<br/>Me: "Too scary? Okay - um - she notices somebody's following her ... she's not sure who it is."<br/>Sofia: "Who is it?"<br/>Me: "It's Draco Malfoy. But Hermoine doesn't know that."<br/>Sofia: "Try a different way."<br/>Me: "Ugh. Okay. Um. Hermoine sneezes. She thinks she's catching a cold."<br/>Sofia: "Try a different way."<br/>Me: "What? Why?"<br/>Sofia: "I don't want her to get a cold."<br/>Me: (Exasperated.) "I have to cook dinner now."<br/>She's not trying to sabotage - she does have a different creative agenda than I do that I have trouble grokking - and if we didn't have TADW things would be even worse, she'd probably have thrown a temper tantrum when I brought in the dark wizards. <br/><br/>But this is kind of a derailment - so we're all designing story games. How do we decide where to plant the narrative authority flag for default play? Why did you choose "spotlight player gets final say" for Fiasco? Why did Matthijs choose TADW for Archipelago? If Fiasco had TADW would that break the game?

But tricky!<br/><br/>If you want your game to be serious, then it helps if the group agrees before playing. <br/><br/>But agreeing and up front communication is not enough. Sometimes people only agree because they are in the minority. Sometimes people don't know what they want till they start playing. Sometimes people will say, "I absolutely don't want X in the game" and they will be the first person to do X\u2026 breaking their own rule!<br/><br/>Being up front is great, but it is also helpful to have tools to regulate play. In a few of my games, I use the following (which I've taken from business meetings I run)\u2026<br/><br/>If you don't like something, raise your hand and say why. <br/><br/>Then if people agree with you, they also raise their hand. <br/><br/>If the majority agrees, then what you don't like is vetoed.<br/><br/>If they don't, you don't get what you want. But we note your specific objection and you get some sort of in game resource for your trouble.<br/><br/>The 3rd time you do this\u2026 we stop the game and discuss what the problem is as a group. Generally if someone objects to a game's content 3 times in a single game, there is a larger problem and voting won't solve it\u2026 only discussing the underlining issue.<br/><br/>I've played with many variations of the above and find this works consistently. It doesn't solve larger problems, but it can help everyone realize there is a major problem asap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321086/#Comment_321086" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T10:38:25+00:00" title="April 18, 2011 10:38AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Getting on the same page is crucial.

It's like how earlier versions of Primetime Adventures really relied on the players to create a really badass premise that everybody was on board with, and the game really works less well when that doesn't happen.  For PTA, this is something that Matt's trying to address more directly in the current revision and I'm trying to look at the same thing for Geiger Counter.<br/><br/>If the players are inclined to be silly, Geiger Counter and Fiasco and PTA and other games can all do silly.  For a while, I was worried that Geiger Counter could only do Scifi channel TV movies like Sharktopus.  But then I played with players who really got on the same page about creating an Alien vibe or something that was more focused.  And then it really kicked ass.  So I'm trying to figure out how to encode that attitude better in the text and procedures rather than just hoping that the players approach it the right way.  It's tough!  Really, as a designer, you have to rely on the players for so many things, but if you rely on them too much, I feel like you're not really doing your job as the designer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321092/#Comment_321092" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T11:21:18+00:00" title="April 18, 2011 11:21AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Getting on the same page is crucial.

Be intentional and start your session with a conversation about tone\u2014see what the mood is, and then ask people to choose Elements that will reinforce that. It isn\u2019t a guarantee, but it can help set the tone a lot.<br/><br/>This approach should be your default, particularly if you\u2019re playing with some of the weirder Playsets or the softer tables offered in this book (see page XX). Player choices are absolutely going to drive any session of Fiasco, so if you really, really want a gentle, funny game you need to make that clear. You and your friends can be judicious about what Elements you choose in the Setup and Tilt to support the tone you all want. Nothing will replace this conversation, followed by your individual judgment, in making the game do what you want it to.<br/><br/>That said, tone sometimes just happens\u2014without really planning on it, you realize your session is incredibly melancholy, or subversively funny, or gritty and terrible. This can be satisfying and surprising as well, so don\u2019t feel the need to talk it out in advance unless you have something specific in mind."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321109/#Comment_321109" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T13:29:25+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  1:29PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A thing about "silly" is once you've gone there you can't really go back. Somebody might crack a joke not even intending it to go into the fiction (this almost happened with my last Montsegur game) and then somebody 'yes, ands' it and it's stuck there - and then things snowball. Or it becomes a flaw in what otherwise was a fine diamond.<br/><br/>Ok - cool - thinking about this more, I can imagine breaking it down into -<br/><br/>Where do you draw the line:<br/>* Narrate whatever you want (Archipelago, Fiasco)<br/>* Narrate almost whatever you want - may be exceptions like "no killing other PC's" (Montsegur, S/lay w/ Me)<br/>* Narrate up to everyone else's skin (Polaris, In a Wicked Age)<br/>* Narrate up to my skin (Annalise)<br/>* Can't narrate a damn thing (without spending resources) (Universalis)<br/><br/>Then mechanisms kick in - some of these are ... "subtractive" or "correctional" ... they kick in once you've narrated something someone else doesn't like.<br/>* Try a Different Way, You Ask Far Too Much, No You Don't You Asshole<br/>Some of them are "additive" - they kick in because you want to narrate past your default authority.<br/>* Seizing a moment in Annalise, pushing in Microscope; rolling the dice in Smallville<br/>Games with lower default narrative authority probably have 'additive' mechanics, while games with high default narrative authority probably have 'subtractive' or correctional mechanics.<br/><br/>All of these systems work most of the time.<br/><br/>Here's my half-baked ideas and a summary of what you guys have said so far:<br/><br/>Advantages of the "Narrate Whatever" (with or without some corrections) end of the spectrum:<br/>* easier to explain to newbies; more accessible<br/>* easier to "tell a story"<br/>* plays faster, because you don't have to pull out conflict mechanics to advance the story<br/>If you have TADW - you can start with this and then correct on-the-fly to the narrative authority level the group's comfortable with: "Can you try a different way? I don't like other people controlling my character."<br/><br/>Disadvantage of "Narrate Whatever"<br/>* easier to abuse (whether accidentally due to out-of-sync agendas or not)<br/>* more likely to "go silly"<br/>* harder to "be there"<br/><br/>Advantages of the other end, "Narrate up to my skin"<br/>* more trad - rpg vets more comfortable<br/>* encourages going to resolution mechanics, which is usually the heart of a given game, where the fun is                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321110/#Comment_321110" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T13:34:56+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  1:34PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two observations: <br/><br/>1.

One of the main reasons is that, for people used to GM-ful play, the GM is normally responsible for filtering what becomes part of the fiction, cutting out the silly stuff, etc.  In a GM-less game, this is the responsibility of the entire group and, if nobody steps forward to enforce this, there is no filter and you're off to gonzo-land.  But, the more people engage with GM-less play, the more the players are prepared to take on responsibilities like maintaining tone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321243/#Comment_321243" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T13:19:46+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  1:19PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe off-topic, but I have to say this:<br/><br/>The discussion above about "silly-ness" and how this is a group issue, rather than a game issue, is awesome.
