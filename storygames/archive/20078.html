I'm a long time game player, been developing games (or rather trying) for the last couple years now. But things tend to be busy so I've only had a chance to work on my pet project during my down time. Here's the elevator pitch:<br/><br/>"In Somnia is a psychological thriller RPG where the players take on the roles of investigators, criminals, or anything else they can think of. They are tasked, for one reason or another with entering the dreams of others, or pulling others into their dreams to accomplish various tasks.  Thinking in the realm of movies like <i>Inception</i>, <i>The Cell,</i> and <i>Dreamscape</i> (minus the psychics), isn't too far from what I'm aiming at. They will have to think in terms of metaphor and symbolism, while battling personal demons in order to accomplish their tasks."<br/><br/>It's pretty fun in the tests that we've run previously. But it comes down to whether or not our fun is because <i>we</i> know how to play it and our group thinks similarly, or the game can indeed stand on its own. So what I'm looking for in actually several groups of players to run tests independent of me in their own time, and report back to me with their findings. Thats pretty much it. No particular interests are required to play outside of what was previously mentioned. All playtesters will be credited properly in the final version.<br/><br/>Ideally, I would like my groups to be able to record their sessions and send them back to me upon completion of each one so I can study it. But, I know thats not always reasonable. I would like to have each GM answer a series of pre-arranged questions (and bring to my attention stuff I didnt think of) after they play, and send those to me as well. I'd like this to start within the next month or so.  You can let me know through here, send me a private message, or contact me via skype at ferninjitsu.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443784/#Comment_443784" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-07T15:02:38+00:00" title="March  7, 2015  3:02PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ferinja, it's great you have enthusiasm for game development.<br/>Some general advice:<br/>- Best way to motivate people for playtesting is to post some draft/alpha PDF of the game.<br/>- You should point out what makes your game <i>unique</i>. <br/>Does it have a unique <i>setting</i> so far not covered by other games?<br/>Does it use some intriguing <i>game mechanic</i>?<br/>- That being said: Have you looked at other games from the same genre?

I realize i didn't address a lot of those things you brought up. Here's some more info:<br/><br/>The pdf won't be available unfortunately until we're at a point I'm comfortable with in play testing. I'm working with some new ideas (and some old ones) that work really well with my group so I'm just trying to play my cards a little close to my chest right now with the game system as a whole. <br/><br/>The setting i mentioned before i tried to research and couldn't find any dream sharing type rpgs. If anyone knows of any please let me know! I would love to read them. Its easily my favorite setting. <br/><br/>It doesn't really go with any existing systems but i suppose it could work with fate (everything runs in fate haha). It would just have to be tailored. <br/><br/>The game itself is about the players who are dream invading adventurers a la movies i previously mentioned. I noticed through testing that there is a certain diversity in application to the setting. The testers in my group have run games as doctors, criminals, police investigators, academics, and even private citizens who use dream sharing to invade people's minds for various reasons including treatment of psychological maladies, thought stealing, plain old assassination, etc. All the while evading hostile dream elements manifested by their own personal torments (A person with arachniphobia bringing in a swarm of spiders, etc).<br/><br/>Player characters pick character concept, goals for their character (how they regain their sanity lost from experiencing trauma or spent as a resource for advantages), and torments from their past. It is class based which i know a lot of people frown on these days but it works well with what were trying to do. The system itself has very few stats to manage and can change their concepts or goals at will. <br/><br/>Characters who are lucid in the dream (the PCs most the time) have almost godlike power within the dream. But have to moderate  themselves and the changes they make lest they change the dream for the worst. They may inadvertently cause physics to alter, dream elements to lash out or bring in something unwanted from their own minds. <br/><br/>Needless to say im pretty excited about it. I hope this clears up a lot of your questions!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443815/#Comment_443815" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T13:21:42+00:00" title="March  8, 2015  1:21PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ferninja, as for approach, transparency of your development process is also a great motivator for potential playtesters.<br/><br/>As for other games, what comes into mind first is <i>Lacuna</i>.<br/>I can also think of adopting <i>DRYH (Don't Rest Your Head) or Dread </i> come into my mind. Also, there are a bunch of <i>Transhuman RPGs</i> that seem suitable/adaptable to me.<br/>Googling "inception rpg" dug up also <a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/ftb/index.php/archives/2058" rel="nofollow">this</a>.<br/><br/>Personally, I think I would use a game based on <i>Leverage RPG (Cortex Plus Action)</i> for system and Shadowrun as setting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
