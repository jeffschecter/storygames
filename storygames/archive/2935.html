We decided to set the coup in present day Great Britain- not to comment on Blair\xe2\u20ac\u2122s political plight but because we had played before in a fictional country and wanted to see how it work with a setting that we had some vague, basic level familiarity with. Coup had worked fine when we played before but it is the longest and most complicated of my short dictator games. Previous playtest report at <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=848&amp;page=1#Item_7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=848&amp;page=1#Item_7</a><br/><br/>I wanted to see if some changes would produce the same effect (like free-form Junta) with fewer sub-systems and without need for a moderator. The biggest change was pre-creating 6 targets each and placing them on the table on sticky notes. Each target had a strategic value that also indicated how notorious a move against the target would be. With these values pre-determined, there was no need for a GM to rank them in play. I also tried to accelerate the schedule of retribution by the government since that hadn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t kicked in much last time, and eliminated ranking the \xe2\u20ac\u02dcstory\xe2\u20ac\u2122 impacts of actions.<br/><br/>Character creation stayed the same- bidding for honors that the characters had won when they were military cadets in the same graduating class. Judson\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Col. Bathymetry had been tops at mathematics and was known as the altar boy of his class; he ended up with more persuasion than money or violence. Josh\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Maj. Gen. Had excelled at drill and military history and somehow had a rep as the biggest bully and the most popular student. He had three times as many points of violence as money or persuasion. My maj. Gen smythe (retired, currently a military analyst with the BBC) had won prizes at English, civics, and rhetoric and had high amounts of money and persuasion. We chose our character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s main motivation for leading a coup: end the unholy alliance with the U.S; restore the empire; stop the war in Iraq. With these mixed goals we launched into a 3 day coup, first choosing to pre-plan up to one action per day on the calendars. <br/><br/>The rules changes had some obvious effects:<br/>\xc2\xb7\tPlayers clashed more. With a limited number of targets, and only 3 targets worth 4 strategy points, our characters went after the same targets and interfered with each other more often. Early in the game, Joshua and I kept preventing each other from seizing the queen and prime minister.<br/>\xc2\xb7\tActions were more transparent. Under the former rules, most coup actions were secretly passed to the GM and other players only found out about them in the next morning\xe2\u20ac\u2122s newspaper. This time everyone immediately knew what was going down, and had a chance to respond (see point above). I miss the paranoia built into the earlier rules but will go with increased interaction over mystery. Anyway, another dictator game, sic semper tyrannus, is all about the frustration of being in the dark.<br/>\xc2\xb7\tPlayers cooperated more. Because the reprisals by Blair\xe2\u20ac\u2122s govt had more teeth this time, and because the competition made us spend more of our points, we had to call upon each other to borrow power to stay in the game. Which I think created a nice balance of backstabbing and supporting. <br/>\xc2\xb7\tIt is easier to succeed. Knowing what actions would be worth made it easier to accumulate enough strategy to collectively succeed in overthrowing the PM. This is mitigated by the increased potential for interfering. <br/><br/><br/>We also figured out some changes during and post playtest:<br/><br/>\xc2\xb7\tPlayers can \xe2\u20ac\u02dcsteal\xe2\u20ac\u2122 a target that another player has already seized control of, the stealing player gets individual strategy and notoriety but the collective do not get additional strategy points towards coup success.<br/>\xc2\xb7\tAt end of game, char with most strat + notoriety is new leader. Other char, if strat higher than notoriety, become part of new govt. If notoriety higher, suffer some shocking fate.<br/>\xc2\xb7\tNotoriety level at beginning of day plus the most notorious action during the day = notoriety the next day<br/>\xc2\xb7\tWhen characters are competing for a target, the one with the highest margin of victory wins. If one char is trying to stop another from succeeding, the points spent by the meddler are subtracted from the active player.<br/>\xc2\xb7\tThe number of people impacted by an action can raise the notoriety awarded and the highest ranking person impacted can raise the strategy<br/>\xc2\xb7\tCan call for help if attacked by govt<br/>\xc2\xb7\tWriting that the leader \xe2\u20ac\u02dctries to assassinate player\xe2\u20ac\u2122 is incorrect phrasing: only characters are targeted in the game<br/><br/>With these changes to Coup, I think that I am done running play tests. I need to transition to producing nine booklets.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66639/#Comment_66639" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T00:15:08+00:00" title="May  3, 2007 12:15AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's interesting, Mark. I've always been <i>sort of</i> interested in this game, but never interested enough to...you know...offer to run it or anything. But setting it in modern-day Britain really brings it to life for me.<br/><br/>There was a BBC series a while ago called A Very British Coup. It reminds me of that.
