But that picture is from the 1994 Super Nintendo X-Men Mutant Apocalypse game I believe.

My preference for no prep light games (and especially games with no single GM) is to have text we can mostly read out loud at the gaming table together. <br/><br/>If I had more time there would be embedded video examples, actual play photos, cross linking (all special terms link to their definitions), the option to have the document read the "read out loud" boxes for you, as well as different layout formats to support mobile devices. I would probably experiment with creating everything as HTML or XML that can be repackaged into PDFs, apps, or other file formats. <br/><br/>I'm happy I implemented the QR codes, especially on the character sheet. Last night we played a quick demo and a friend asked, "where can I get this" and she pointed her phone at the code and then suddenly she was browsing the files on her computer!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355504/#Comment_355504" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T13:33:49+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  1:33PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, this is really awesome!<br/><br/>I particularly love the GM advice.

So much good stuff on so little space!</blockquote>\nThanks Paul! I'm very proud of the GM tips section. I made it into a little game for myself. How much can I fit into this small space while still saying what I think would be most useful to a new GM. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>One question: what's the "first say" business? Is that a Psi*Run thing?</blockquote>\n"First say" is indeed Psi*Run specific. Someone asked about this on G+. I'll paste my answer below...<br/>\n<blockquote> In my opinion, it builds on the idea of what a roleplaying game is in Apocalypse World...<br/><br/>"Roleplaying is a conversation. You and the other players go back and forth, talking about these fictional characters in their fictional circumstances doing whatever it is that they do. Like any conversation, you take turns, but it\u2019s not like taking turns, right? Sometimes you talk over each other, interrupt, build on each others\u2019 ideas, monopolize. All fine."<br/><br/>Strangely, the last part above is one of the few things I don't like about Apocalypse World in play. All of the games I've been in (with a wide assortment of groups and people) have had uneven spotlight where less outspoken players get less of a turn. <br/><br/>In Psi*Run, roleplaying is like a conversation except there is an explicit structure to who says what and when. When you describe something that might go wrong, is dangerous, or might trigger a memory, you roll dice. You split up your roll among multiple categories but you have a choice of which dice go in which category. Do you put your low dice in the Goal category thus losing your Goal, do you put your high dice in the Reveal category, thus ensuring you remember who you are? <br/><br/>But it's not all about winning and losing. It's also about who gets to say how you win or lose. <br/><br/>"First Say" tells us who gets first say in describing or defining how you win or lose in a specific category. The reason it is "First Say" and not "Only Say" is because it's all a conversation and other people can offer details but the rules are explicit on who gets to drive the conversation in that particular topic at that specific time. But it's also a choice, you choose which dice go in which category. So if you want "First Say" allocate your dice according to your hearts desire!</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355537/#Comment_355537" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T15:51:28+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  3:51PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The pre-order is up! <br/><br/>You can <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/129" rel="nofollow">buy the Psi*Run PDF</a> for just $10! <br/><br/>Or <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/129" rel="nofollow">buy the Psi*Run book</a> for $20 and get the PDF free. <br/><br/>International shipping to anywhere in the world only adds $2 to the shipping costs... it's too good  I almost think it's a mistake. <br/><br/>To play my X-Men hack, you need the Psi*Run rules. A lot of the basic rules are on the Risk sheet but there is a lot of info only in the book. Things I missed the first time I ran that I wish I went back and read more thoroughly. Like how do you pick which question to answer on a 4-5 result in the Reveal category? Or what happens when you reveal a question when the player has empty questions slots? <br/><br/>Also the book contains lots of great advice on running the game. I especially love the examples. The book includes little drawings of the players talking back and forth as they play to illustrate what actually happens at the table to quickly get an idea of how to run everything smoothly.

I looked at the problems I encountered at Recess and rewrote my "how to run this at cons" script to hopefully stop the problems before they start. For example, I made the setting information clearer for those unfamiliar with the material, made the fist scene text shorter, emphasized to keep your character concept loose, not to answer your questions, that your questions aren't answered till you roll them (even if it feels like they've been answered in the story), as well as including a tracker for the GM to help manage the spotlight. <br/><br/>I totally agree about being clear who the text is referring to. In this case, I believe this text primarily refers to the person running the game and is written from that perspective. Most (if not all) of the text that the players need to pay attention to is included inside special boxes the GM reads out loud. If I had time, and this was a commercial product, I would have an editor look it all over to make sure any potential rough spots were smoothed over. But looking at it quickly, it seems ok in this regard. <br/><br/>No one seemed to have any problems knowing when to roll but... we did run into problems where someone's goal was to remember something or to run away. Rules wise, those aren't valid goals (I think) because other categories cover those details. We had a single instance where we didn't have a goal, but it still made sense to roll, so we had to come up with a goal of some sort. The "roll to show off how awesome you are" never came up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355556/#Comment_355556" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T16:51:37+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  4:51PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Are there any rules that you added for the hack, rules not in regular Psi*Run?

Secondary goals is to have as much of the text as possible read out loud, have parts you can pass off to the players to read, and make it easy to reference in play. In this case there isn't much to reference as these aren't the actual Psi*Run rules. But if there were rules to reference, I would try to make it as easy as possible. <br/><br/>That said, I did most of this in my free time and in a hurry. If I dedicated more time to it, it could be greatly improved. I would likely draw comic book illustration ala Understanding Comics walking you through each step.
