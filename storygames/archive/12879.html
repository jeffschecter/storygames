(Combined, this needed three different boxes to ship, so was a pretty large collection.) Books which survived this culling fell into one of two categories: collector's editions (gilt edged or what long time Shadowrunners would know as a BABY) and boxed sets.<br/><br/>Prior to this I culled a <em>huge</em> amount of stuff in order to move away from Colorado. From a ton of AD&amp;D stuff, I kept only the original Deities &amp; Demigods and the Manual of the Planes (which I still have). I also kept the original Battletech house books and my Traveller black box. I miss quite a bit of stuff I gave up now and again (Star Frontiers, Top Secret, Gamma World, Paranoia... sniff). Most of it I have since managed to get electronically. Some of it not (particularly Time and Time Again and Lords of Creation, not to mention a cherry version of the board game Shogun).<br/><br/>I did keep a large supply of Dragon magazines (from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2368&amp;Mode=like">#68</a> to about #130) during this move, thinking them crucial and worth shipping. They sat on a shelf until moved again, then again. When another move came, I found them a better home with a friend of mine. What helped to make this choice was buying the Dragon CD-ROM, which had them all electronically (I've even accessed these once or twice since).<br/><br/>Going forward, I'm not buying hard-copies of much (I made the mistake of asking Quicken to tell me how much I've spent at drive-thru rpg a while back... I've been busy). I tend to get stuff that has limited runs (if they sold a leather bound D&amp;D4, for example, I'd be all over that) or things that don't translate electronically (I just got my copy of Freemarket, for example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289946/#Comment_289946" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T12:37:31+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 12:37PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh!

But in late 2000 I came back to America after being in Japan for a number of years. Brought with me 3 cats, 1 wife and no career. I had to start over from scratch, basically. They were fun times, but definitely very frugal.<br/><br/>Anyway, I happened to end up in NC, where my folks lived, and to basically clean up my folks' house, clean up my life a bit, and make some money in the progress, I proceeded to sell just about everything I had accumulated: Mostly books, games, etc. The thrill of basically slimming down my life caught on, and I basically from that point on had an unwritten rule that my games wouldn't take up more than "two shelves" before I started selling again. In truth, it wasn't a real rule or anything, but it sure felt right. I've gone over at times, in fact right now I'm kind of at 2.5 shelves (but I've got some multiple copies of various games, plus that includes the stuff I plan on selling off soon).<br/><br/>At the time, I ended up selling everything I had, and made a few thousand. Everything from classic D&amp;D to WoD to Fading Suns to Shadowrun. The only things I kept at that time were:<br/><br/>A set of Planescape stuff, some signed by Tony DiTerlizzi<br/>A set of Blue Planet books<br/>Sengoku and a few supplements<br/>Fudge<br/>D&amp;D 3e PHB<br/>BESM 2nd Edition<br/>Dark Sun set<br/>1 copy of AD&amp;D 2e, still in a weird faux-pleather tome cover thing I bought at a GenCon way back when. This was the book that turned me from a casual RPGer to "heads over heels in love with The Game".<br/>A copy of The End<br/>D&amp;D Rules Cyclopedia<br/>D&amp;D Mystara: Kingdom of Nithia<br/>Some L5R books<br/>Some Tribe 8 books<br/>Star Wars d6 Revised and Expanded<br/>Continuum<br/>And a few various AD&amp;D items<br/><br/>Cut to almost ten years later, from that original set here's what I have left:<br/><br/>Planescape<br/>Blue Planet<br/>Sengoku<br/>That AD&amp;D 2e PHB in its cover<br/>The End<br/>D&amp;D Mystara: Kingdom of Nithia (I love the illustrations of egyptian fantasy warriors, great stuff)<br/>Continuum<br/><br/>I will likely actually be getting rid of Blue Planet and Sengoku at some point, maybe even some of the Planescape stuff as well. My interests have changed too much, there's likely no chance of using it again... The only memento I'll be likely keeping is that copy of the 2e PHB...<br/><br/>Anyway, I really dig living with less. If nothing else, it's much easier to clean, and I don't have to buy nearly as many bookshelves and stuff.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290688/#Comment_290688" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T21:10:15+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  9:10PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My plan is simply to buy a bigger house...this whole "culling" thing seems like some sort of deranged blasphemy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290693/#Comment_290693" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T21:30:39+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  9:30PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2010 9:31PM by johnzo.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Notable stuff I've parted with:</b> A shelf-yard of GURPS 3e sourcebooks.

So make that three medium-sized boxes plus an xbox-sized box. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291236/#Comment_291236" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T14:32:05+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  2:32PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I purge constantly.
