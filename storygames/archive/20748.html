The summary is they loved it (their first RPG!)<br/><br/>The spirit animal character generation really captured their imaginations.<br/><br/>quick summary - their job was hunting for an important festival.  The GM tasked one with taming an animal pet and the other with finding a valuable item.  They happened upon a monstrous boar but rather kill it, they managed to calm it by feeding it berries and eventually it became tamed, earning a mark.  They camped at a pile of stones made from a broken ancient building, and a storm came scaring the boar -  it burrowed vigorously into the shale, exposing the entrance to a tomb where one player found a runed bone fetch, earning his mark.  They hunted a deer and came back to the village, victorious, one riding his boar which reminded the wise women of tales told of an ancient hero.<br/><br/>Im not sure about 'cleverly' and 'helpfully' as those seem to be better suited to player narration of their actions.  <br/><br/>What about 'cautiously' which implies harm minimization?  I know there is 'carefully' but that could be more about avoiding mistakes.  <br/><br/>I might try tweaking the rules a bit so that the players state 2 tags as part of their intent (3 seems a bit of a reach), and then the rolls take those  away such as:<br/><br/><b>10+</b>   all good, happens as tagged<br/><b>7-9 </b>   player decides which of their tags doesnt happen - success, with minor complication (presumably related to the tag that didnt happen)<br/><b>4-6</b>    neither tag applies, success with significant complication<br/><b>1-3</b>     dilemma  - GM offers choice of success with major complication, or failure.<br/><br/>I think stating the entirety of the intent first, with the downgrading later, is more natural and flows better.  <br/><br/>Anyway, Ill give the above a go, and report back<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455713/#Comment_455713" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-22T07:16:49+00:00" title="August 22, 2016  7:16AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2016 7:27AM by stefoid.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had another short session with the kids.<br/><br/>Im not sure stating the adjectives up front is a good idea any more.  They tend to be used as a substitute for inventive narration.  "I attack him forcefully and quickly"  gets pretty old.<br/><br/>I suppose it would help if I followed the PDF advice and asked the kids to elaborate on the tags they choose, which is the reason they are there, I now realise - to be a seed to kickstart their imaginations.<br/><br/>We did a few combats which I struggled with.  There are no hit points which is fine, but that makes it hard to define partial success, and  I find all or nothing combat a bit anti-climactic.  Perhaps I need just need to get over that.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455737/#Comment_455737" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-23T00:41:24+00:00" title="August 23, 2016 12:41AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you read all the previous S-G threads about the Wildlings?
