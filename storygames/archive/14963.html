Lovecraft's birthday and Summer (although, of course it is raining as I type this), I'm running a competition. The idea is simple: send Yoggie a scenario on a postcard. A shortlist will be selected by popular acclaim and a secret cabal of judges will select the winners. <br/><br/>Pelgrane Press are happy to provide prize support for this contest, which includes ephemera, a clue to the Darcy mystery and a $50 Pelgrane Press voucher, with two $25 runner-up prizes.<br/> <br/>Send your post card to this address :<br/>Postcard Competion<br/>Innsmouth House <br/>P.O. Box 315<br/>SHIPLEY, BD18 9DB<br/>United Kingdom<br/> <br/>The Rules:<br/>- The scenario should fit on one side of a single postcard, no larger than A5 in size. <br/>- The scenario should relate to the image on the front and contain no references to rules (so it is playable with any system). <br/>- The front can contain minor annotations (such as dingbats or numbers) linked to writing on the back but not extra writing.<br/>- The postcard doesn't have to contain the whole detailed scenario but should be enough for a Keeper to run the game.<br/>- The closing date is Hallowe'en 2011. Any postcards received after that date will not be considered for a prize.<br/> <br/>(Thanks to Dave L, see <a href="http://www.yog-sothoth.com/threads/14264-Dear-Yoggie...-Postcards-Posted?p=224007&amp;viewfull=1#post224007" rel="nofollow">here</a> for his card which inspired this competition, for Paul of Cthulhu for hosting the competition and Pelgrane Press for providing prize support)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
