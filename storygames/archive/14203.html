Something is growing in the slums of Bethnal Green. Some might call it a new religion, others may see it as a political movement. Those in power see it as dangerous, but those caught up in it see it as salvation. And you? You are as close to the centre of it as it is possible to be. Will this be your destruction or will it take you to the stars themselves?<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: Scott Dorward<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Dead of Night: The Future Generation</b><br/>\nLewisham, 1979. The third year of Meadhall Secondary School are going through some changes. Puberty has brought some unexpected side-effects, and their bodies and minds are changing in ways that their biology teacher never mentioned, some for the better, some for the worse. The driven ones are finding new ways to use these abilities to try to get the things they've always wanted, no matter who gets hurt. Your world is becoming a very dangerous place, and that's without thinking about the black vans that seem to be following you, or those creepy little fuckers in the second year who don't seem to need to use words to speak to each other\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nThis uses a slightly modified version of Dead of Night, designed for player characters with unnatural abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: Scott Dorward<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Dust Devils: Redemption</b><br/>\nTwo weeks ago, William Benton visited Anna Mercer. She laughed at his small pecker, he slashed her face. Joseph paid Mary Knox for her loss of earnings as Anna can\u2019t work no more. William is now paying him back. He\u2019s just arrived in town with the latest installment: a lot, from selling stolen cattle. But Anna and her friends have scraped together a reward for his death, and Charles Sanford has arrived in town to do the deed. The PCs are all intimately involved with one or more of these characters, and everyone has guns. What are the chances of death and mayhem?<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: Neil Smith<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Never to Die: Breaking Up is Hard to Do</b><br/>\nAnother gig, another after party; you're all young, famous and rich, a chart topping boyband with a string of hits and a fanatical following of girls, young women and gay men. You're on fire and the papers love giving you coverage.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight, it all ends, because candles that burn brighter also burn shorter... Tonight is the night that tragedy strikes and brings an end to all your dreams.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Never to Die is a game about a lad's night out in a typical British city; the player's take on the roles of the lads, who look for fun, test their courage and strengthen their bonds with their mates. The GM is the City and portrays everyone, everywhere &amp; everything the lads encounter. It's like a chav dungeon crawl, but it ends in a tragedy when one of the lads goes too far and something happens that ends not only that night out but all their nights out together as lads.</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Each lad is based on an archetype and they interact with each other by giving dice to or taking them from other lads when they roll to do something; this can cost a lad something or give them a bonus. The City has a limited amount of challenge to face the lads with it; when it runs out, the tragedy occurs and the game wraps up.</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Warning: This game is rated '18' for strong language, violence, alcohol/drug references and sexual situations.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nGM: James Mullen<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Mansions of Madness</b> is a multiplayer board game that pits a team of investigators against the evil lurking in a hidden house. Can you unravel the clues before all is lost ?<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: Andy Nicholson<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Unknown Armies: Happy Families</b><br/>\nA meeting has been arranged in a lonely, run-down motel off Route 89 in Arizona. It is not a meeting that should change the world. The outcome should affect few people other than those in attendance. It is only meant to be a simple exchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing is ever that simple, though. Everyone lies. Everyone has their own agendas. Everyone has a secret. And sometimes not even the players know what the stakes are.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note that while this game uses the setting from Unknown Armies, the mechanics will be those from Hot War. Some knowledge of the UA setting would be beneficial, but is not essential.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: Scott Dorward                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339026/#Comment_339026" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T11:21:15+00:00" title="August 16, 2011 11:21AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>LATE CHANGE TO ARRANGEMENTS</b><br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, due to a coinciding event, Bob the Diceman will <b>not</b> be able to make it to Concrete Cow 11.5, so there will not be a Reaper's Revenge stall at the event, but Leisure Games will still be represented.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's still time to put your name down as a GM for the day; just post the details of your proposed game on this thread and I'll add them to the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow Wiki page</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341540/#Comment_341540" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-04T02:56:11+00:00" title="September  4, 2011  2:56AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2011 2:58AM by Neil.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Less than two weeks to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow</a>, so time for another post reminding you to come along.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, <b>come to Concrete Cow!</b> Consider yourselves reminded.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow games page</a> is filling up nicely, but we could always do with more games.

To the lawless denizens of the Bleed, whether they be pirates, gangsters or tyrants, you\u2019re known in less flattering terms.

You\u2019re the seasoned freelancers local leaders call when a situation proves too tough, too baffling, or simply too weird to handle on their own. In the abandoned fringe of inhabited planets known as the Bleed, you\u2019re as close to a higher authority as they come.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIn this gritty space opera game, the PCs are Lasers, freelance troubleshooters and law enforcers operating in a remote sector called the Bleed. They\u2019re needed in the wake of a massive retreat by the Combine,  the utopian empire that colonized it. Amid the ashes of a devastating war, the lasers solve mysteries, fix thorny problems, and explore strange corners of space\u2014all on a contract basis.
