So, feel free to post here with your completed jobs, outlining whether or not you would have taken the job outside the Villages experiment.<br/><br/>If you're going to post feedback about the experience of work ethics and process, that's cool too.

It was an enjoyable way to spend an evening, but I wouldn't have done it without Villages.cc. I honestly felt a bit like I was taking advantage, since he was offering a full hour for each, and they were easy to pound out quickly.<br/><br/>I read Gary M's 200+ page necromancer novel, and wrote a few pages of comments and critiques. This was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the book, and got to do a critique at a level of detail I am not sure I've ever done before. I certainly wouldn't have done it without Villages.cc, but it was very worthwhile.<br/><br/><br/>Jobs posted:<br/><br/>I asked for people to read or playtest my game. So far, I've gotten three readers, and three people who are at least somewhat likely to playtest it soon. This is six more people than I had previously gotten by advertising on Google+. I think I would have gotten more useful feedback if I had asked more specific questions, but it's cool to know that people are reading my game. (And if someone plays it, that will be completely awesome.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387272/#Comment_387272" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-16T08:41:30+00:00" title="August 16, 2012  8:41AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jobs Offered<br/>-&gt; I've offered hours for creation of Dungeon World content, but I've had no responses yet.
