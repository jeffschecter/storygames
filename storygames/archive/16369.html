We don't have an RPG.net. What we have, is rollespill.net, which started out sort of RPG.net-ish; then we tried to turn it into The Forge; and now it's more like Story Games. The forum has a bad rep among "traditional" players, and those who like to chill out and talk (we used to be pretty heavy on post moderation). So recruiting people to our existing forum is probably not the way to go.<br/><br/>However, I'd like to have somewhere for everyone to talk. What would be a good way to go about this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373907/#Comment_373907" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T23:10:55+00:00" title="April 20, 2012 11:10PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Create a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">new</span> forum, maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373908/#Comment_373908" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T23:20:53+00:00" title="April 20, 2012 11:20PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

The only to avoid pissing off someone is to stop talking (or at least stop saying anything meaningful), you could end with a forum full of people, but useless for anything apart pissing some time away talking about the new Big Movie.<br/><br/>If you are really sure... dumb the forum down. Find some "enemy", somewhere, another forum is the better option, and start a "war" against them "to save the rpg hobby". Wait for the wanna-be heroes to show up (the "enemy" forum surely had pissed of someone, and they will flock to your banner to fight the fight) and start patting their backs and playing their ego.  Start telling each other that you (the people in the forum) are the very best players and GMs, but never say why (if you say anything related to actual gaming techniques and situation you will dispel the illusion that you are talking about the same thing. For the same reason discourage any discussion based on actual play or actual gaming techniques)<br/><br/>And, remember: nothing in this new forum has to be valued more than the mantra "we are all friends here". Nothing. Anybody should be able to say anything, to matter how ridiculous or moronic: saying that they are wrong or debating the issue is bad for forum attendance, nobody like to post in a place where you risk being proved wrong. "It's not something that friends do, so you are not my friends".  Stomp critical thinking hard, and make it very clear that you don't tolerate THAT in your forum.<br/><br/>I can't guarantee that you will get a lot of new people (there are really a lot of forum like this around, people have a lot of choice), but this is the way they do it in a most of successful forums (not only about rpgs)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373929/#Comment_373929" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T07:30:58+00:00" title="April 21, 2012  7:30AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps it was the moderation.

I don't mean, like, rent a booth there of stuff: I mean you yourself and any others who are in on the project. I just mean: hang out with people, talk to lots of people, and maybe have a nice good stack of business cards w/the "new forum" address on them. Give out the cards with the forum address to people you'd like to have a follow-up conversation with, or to people who would like to follow up on a conversation with you \u2014 instead of giving them an e-mail address or a Facebook screen name or whatever.<br/><br/>Also: "the new forum" can actually be that same old forum, no problem, as long as the people who run it <i>really</i> want to change their policies, moderation style and overall social footprint. Sure, it will take a long time before those individuals who once felt alienated go full circle and come back to you, but if you really want a change to happen start focusing on new people, be as welcoming as you can, and in the end even those you burned will be able to see you're not the same old forum you used to be (except, you know, if you actually <i>are</i>!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
