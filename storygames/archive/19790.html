However, I'm beginning to wonder if some of them are getting too complicated. I try to give each playbook its own core mechanic and enough options to make it fun, but most of the base playbooks are are lot more simplified. Does anyone else feel this way?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438974/#Comment_438974" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-03T21:38:38+00:00" title="October  3, 2014  9:38PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I mean, there's only so many things you can do with playbooks without copying what's been done...plus, the temptation to do your own funky mechanical things is ever-present...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439192/#Comment_439192" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T11:55:59+00:00" title="October  7, 2014 11:55AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Short version, <br/><br/>Complexity itself is not a problem. When things become too complex so that it creates tension/trouble at the table is when we need to look at it. <br/><br/>For World games I distinguish between different complexities.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Understanding complexity</span><br/>How difficult is a move to read and understand. If it has a lot of moving parts it is harder to wrap your head around, especially when it refers to other moves, mechanics, items etc. that people are not familiar with usually. Also moves that make you choose a few things from a list can be harder to understand since you need to compare different combinations of things you can and can't get to fully get what the move is doing. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Handling complexity</span><br/>How complex is the actual process of using the move at the table? A bad example for this might be Druid Shapeshift when it is a new form and now the GM has to come up with moves to give you. Another can be ritual or preparation of your spells. <br/>In short, the longer you need to spend on talking through the mechanical interactions of a move the longer <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strategic complexity</span><br/>How complex is it for you to actually trigger the move? When the move trigger is obscure or vague you might not find (or miss) opportunities for you to use that move. This is related to Understanding complexity but you still could have moves that you constantly forget to apply because their triggers are weird.<br/>Ritual can also be a great example for this because ritual allows you to do EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING is hard to wrap your head around. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fictional complexity</span><br/>This is also a bit arcane. <br/>How much does having this move change the things happening to you? When you take a move that gives you 2 loyal followers suddenly 2 new characters are added to the game and everyone needs to keep them in mind. If you get a minor godly power people might come and worship you. In a way the story gets more complex because you now have these capabilities. <br/>It is also strongly related to fictional effectiveness and potentially mindshare effectiveness.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439193/#Comment_439193" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T12:33:48+00:00" title="October  7, 2014 12:33PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Based on this article by Mark Rosewater.<br/><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/293" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/293</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439200/#Comment_439200" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T13:50:46+00:00" title="October  7, 2014  1:50PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a good article.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439205/#Comment_439205" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T15:02:44+00:00" title="October  7, 2014  3:02PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maro's whole series is amazing for designers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
