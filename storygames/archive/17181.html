It worked as in we ended up with a right old fiasco with closeted homosexual, televangelist High Dragon of the KKK on the lam having broken out of a police station having shot - but not killed - his black southern dame grandee benefactor at a Democratic party picnic, having been blackmailed by a local corrupt official who he'd once had a one night stand with and who also incidentally was the trigger man for the same-said dame in offing her late husband who it turned out was not the father of her son, who was now an ambitious deputy sheriff trying to track the aforementioned gay, dragon, televangelist fugitive down.<br/><br/>Confused? By the end of it, so were we!<br/><br/>Perhaps this came most tellingly when - at the final confrontation at a dark train station, Deputy Julius confronts disgraced televangelist Frank "Let's Be Frank" Franklyn.<br/><br/>Julius: "You killed my father!"<br/>Other players: "Errr... actually, no, that was the official."<br/>Julius: "Oh, well, you killed my mother!"<br/>Other players: "Nooo... actually, that was the official again. This guy just _shot_ your mother and that was after she shot at him first."<br/><b>*BANG*</b><br/>Julius: "Well, whatever, he's dead now..."<br/><br/>Franklyn then, of course, put paid to that by rolling really well in the Aftermath.<br/><br/>How did we get so confused? Because I was also trying out something I'd read in the Jeep dictionary (which I realise now was not specific to Jeep at all) of using a character pool. We had five/six players, four characters, and everyone owned nothing and everything at once.<br/><br/>But, as curious as that might be, that's not what I want to talk about. What I wanted to talk about was the difference it makes to your creativity and (I'm going to use the i word) immersion between 'parlour' live action and tabletop. <br/><br/>Fiasco lends itself to live action, as we saw in the Tabletop episode, it's sometimes hard not to start physically personifying your character, even when you're sitting down. I'm going to note my experience and I wondered if others had the same or different:<br/><br/>-  Engaging my body in live action made it feel harder to be creative: when another player caught me by surprise (for example, when I'm arresting the fugitive in his office, throwing a little girl into the scene to suddenly walk in on us) I found I could literally not think how to respond. Part of this is because you don't have the elements in front of you to spark your imagination (even if they're up on a wall nearby, you typically won't be looking in their direction). <br/><br/>- Because of this, we engaged in more "play before we play" because it is harder to pause/break a live scene than a tabletop.<br/><br/>- We lost much of the 'camera'; the ability of a player to direct our attention by describing a small but significant action and the ability to communicate at a meta level while a scene was in progress.<br/><br/>- Doing it live, I somehow felt less immersed than sitting around a tabletop: sitting down I can picture the scene in my head; acting it out, the scene is in front of me and it makes it harder to imagine what isn't there.<br/><br/>- On the flip side, the moments that were closest to reality hit home harder: in a scene where the High Dragon was sitting around in the klink with his KKK goons and he said "Boys, I have a plan", we all instinctively leaned in closer and - in that split-second - we were truly in the moment.<br/><br/>- Tied to this, when I was in a scene with just one person, you really are just engaging with that person rather than talking to a group.<br/><br/>I figure all of this must be nothing new to larpers. Anyone been able to offset the bad without losing the good? Make it easier to create on your feet rather than on your butt?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389764/#Comment_389764" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-10T20:06:01+00:00" title="September 10, 2012  8:06PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.
