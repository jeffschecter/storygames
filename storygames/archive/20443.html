It's heavily inspired by \u2018revenge flicks\u2019 like Kill Bill, John Wick, Django, etc. It takes a few sessions to play through a whole game, but it's very intense and fun. <br/><br/>I have a few small incentives so that you can get something out of helping me to playtest too: \n<ul><li>Playtesters who give me feedback on mechanics, like what works and what doesn\u2019t, or what feels too hard or too easy, will have their names added to the Credits.</li>\n<li>Playtesters who send me a link to their actual play experience on a blog or forum will receive a free copy of the final release PDF. Additionally, the coolest actual play account will become the basis for the Example Scene later in the book, and this will be credited to you. </li>\n<li>Playtesters who post a pre-release review of reasonable size will get a free copy of the final release PDF and the physical rulebook. </li></ul>\nIf you reckon you can help me out with this, please <a href="http://1drv.ms/20YnzIU" rel="nofollow">download the playtest PDF here</a>. My email is in the PDF if you want to contact me directly, but I'll check in on this thread too. <br/><br/>Thank you all in advance!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449540/#Comment_449540" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-17T06:38:56+00:00" title="November 17, 2015  6:38AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2015 6:52AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of Hollywood's revenge flicks have gotten a little stale and samey for me, but I've <i>never roleplayed</i> the revenge story, so that's enticing!  Also, the revenge flicks that I <i>do</i> like include the Tarantino ones, so I dig your examples.  GMless I can take or leave, but the combo of GMless + competitive sounds appealing, as I don't want to be a ref, nor do my friends.  Competitive sounds awesome; I don't get enough of that in RPGs.  It's also tricky, so I am both enthused about the game's promise and a teeny bit worried about whether it'll deliver.<br/><br/>So, there's my feedback on your pitch.  It worked for me, and I'll be reading the beta.  "How do we compete?" is the first thing I'll be looking for.<br/><br/>I like getting free stuff, and I sometimes like writing AP or reviews, so the incentives are good to know too.  Feedback on mechanics: if you want it, you got it, but I'll ask -- do you still want it if it's only from reading and not from play?  Feel free to say no!

It was a deliberate decision to fit the genre, give the game some personality and "voice", and make it more amusing and engaging to read. I do find it a mild curiosity that some take offense to the swear words but not the subject matter... which includes families being raped and murdered right there in the second paragraph. To me, it's similar to that whole "you can slice her open and have her insides fall to the floor so long as I can't see her nipples" thing. *shrug*<br/><br/>But I digress. That Tripwires rule is pretty much just about making sure it makes sense in the established fiction. Which means if you want some guy to be on fire, you need to first establish in the fiction that there is a fire, or that he's carrying something flammable, or whatever. It's just a guard against immersion-breaking spontaneous combustion <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449566/#Comment_449566" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-18T10:37:20+00:00" title="November 18, 2015 10:37AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, I get why the rule is there.

The consequence of any Tripwire being triggered is that a Trap is drawn. About a third of the Traps help the Reaper a lot, and two-thirds help the Bad Guys to varying degrees. As in, *all* Bad Guys. So Reapers have incentive to trigger Tripwires, and all Bad Guys have incentive to trigger them, and all Bad Guys benefit from Traps which help any of them. There's no incentive for anyone to ever claim that a Tripwire was forced: it would be to their own detriment for zero gain. \n<blockquote>Cool idea! Let me digest the rules.

It's not a game about exploring that stuff in-fiction, it's a game about getting revenge for stuff like that. I've used it to spark that reaction of "Oh fuck these guys right to hell". Though as a father myself, it's the "children murdered" stuff that really incites my rage, so that's in there too. <br/><br/>I look forward to your further thoughts!\n<blockquote>Some more feedback:<br/><br/>* I think the quality of the visual design and presentation is a huge plus, and really gets my attention.<br/><br/>* Making the text open for comments and playtesting will only lead to a stronger game.

Rape is handled in Kill Bill pretty much exactly as I intend it to be handled in Scarlet Wake (if it's handled at all): behind the scenes. The scene with The Bride waking from her coma, and discovering that "Buck" has been pimping out her comatose body to truckers and whoever to do almost anything they want with (sans leaving visible marks) for the past 4 years is a great scene because it really raises my hackles and makes me want to see her find a way out of this situation and beat the shit out of Buck. Which she does, in a brutally cathartic fashion. <br/><br/>The number of dice is a valid issue, and I've thought about it a lot, but I have some specific goals for the mechanics which would be incredibly difficult to achieve with fewer dice.

Currently, if you're aiming to gain a reasonable amount of Fuel, you'll choose to face a number of Mooks 2 above/below your highest possible die (depending on your Stakes). However in these circumstances, since Mooks are eliminated highest-to-lowest, most of the remaining die will be rolls of 1-2. <br/><br/>So if I remove the dice for Mooks, and just say "Mooks deal a flat 2 damage each", and each point of your Damage continues to eliminate one Mook, then it's still a gamble how much Fuel you'll gain, but you don't need a ton of d6s. It's <i>less</i> of a gamble, since dice allowed for unpredictable spikes that could send you into a Bind, so I might need to reduce Fire gain as a result, but that's not hard. <br/><br/>I'm having a lot more trouble eliminating dice from the Traits though. d4s you could do with less of, since as a Reaper, you'll never need more than one, though depending on how you spec your Marks and the potential for Lackeys, you might need another 5. But d12s you'd definitely need 5 for your Reaper and 5 for the Mark, and hope nobody buys a rank 5 Lackey at the same time.<br/><br/>Though it's possibly worth emphasising that the numbers of dice I've listed are for the group as a whole to share... not for individuals to each bring. It doesn't entirely mitigate your point about requiring a lot of dice, but mathematically, if at least two players each bring 5 poly sets, then you have all the dice you need. But I can appreciate that I'm just justifying myself at this point because I don't have a better solution right now. \n<blockquote>The game is seriously beautiful, by the way. Very well done.</blockquote>\nThanks for that huge compliment! It's going to look even better with some of the art I've got coming. I've managed to find some very talented artists. And the final product will be in full-colour (even the print book, because greyscale just doesn't do it justice at all), which is full of vibrant reds and occasional mustardy yellows. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449665/#Comment_449665" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-21T14:03:13+00:00" title="November 21, 2015  2:03PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really very intriguing!

They aren't a *thing* otherwise.<br/><br/>I do have some female playtesters lined up for January, so that's a good and valid suggestion. For me, it's actually important that all my games are playtested with as close to an even gender mix as I can get together. <br/><br/>From my perspective, "rape is a part of the story" as much as murder (which is worse), torture (also worse), and setting people on fire (also worse, and if you're interested, my litmus test for such things is "as a father of a 7yr old girl, which would I be more devastated by if it happened to her"). And it serves the same purpose: an event to make you go "holy shit I'm going to destroy this asshole so hard". <br/><br/>I think there's a really big difference between the following points on the "how much is rape a part of this game" scale: "rape is awesome, let's make rules to encourage players to do it in the game", "rape sounds fun, there's no rules for it but I'm going to enthusiastically write it into my stories and examples", "rape is something unfortunate that happens so it's in the game but there's no rules", "rape isn't in the game at all", "rape is fucked so it's in the game because the game is about getting revenge for fucked up shit" (this is where Scarlet Wake is at), and "rape is fucked and this game is about revenge so there's rules for getting revenge against rapists". Personally, merely reacting to the *presence* of rape in any medium, and ignoring the context and message surrounding it, is a short-sighted reaction which does everyone involved a disservice. <br/><br/>Besides, I get my girlfriend to go over everything I create because she often has excellent feedback and provides perspectives I wouldn't have considered otherwise. She's quick to point out if something feels wrong or if she doesn't like it. Scarlet Wake is the only game she's read where she's said "this actually makes me want to play this" (she's an avid non-gamer). <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449700/#Comment_449700" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-22T22:38:35+00:00" title="November 22, 2015 10:38PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2015 12:23AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>an event to make you go "holy shit I'm going to destroy this asshole so hard".</blockquote>I think it makes perfect sense that all the disgusting shit you wrote about would be on this events list.  The main part that made me go "is this really necessary? if not, remove it" was the combo of said disgusting shit with the in-your-face tough-guy writing voice.  To me, this sounds either gleeful or dressed up for shock value: <br/><br/>"...painted with blood, tears, and cum. Those fuckers tortured, raped, and killed everyone in your family"<br/><br/>No one writing to someone who's actually endured such an atrocity, even if their reaction is homicidal rage, would write about it in such an affected way.  It sounds more like some sleazy tabloid writer writing about something that happened to someone else, and that makes it way more off-putting to me.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/><br/>It's easy to claim problems without proposing solutions.  So, here, this is what would work better for me as a reader:<br/><br/>"What happened that night-  Your vision goes black when you even start to think about it.  Black... then red.  With <i>rage</i>.  Those animals!  <i>Those animals!</i>  Your family, your innocent, kind family, who no one should ever have hurt, and then-  You get sick to your stomach, and your fists clench.

I'm not a huge fan of the "Oh it was so terrible I can't even say it" perspective, but I'll revisit it. <br/><br/>Scarlet Wake can totally be used to just "go postal". The quasi-terrible things your Marks have done are all recorded individually against each one, and there's really no requirement at all that they all relate to the same event, or that the event *needs* to be something extremely traumatic. In the example Reaper the first Mark's Crime was merely filming the whole thing. The only real rule regarding creating your Marks is that the final one is somehow involved with all the players' Reapers' stories. <br/><br/>But you could totally push it the other way to play off some highly strung high school outcast seeking ultimate revenge against peers who didn't invite them to their big party or made a joke at their expense in front of the class if you wanted.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449721/#Comment_449721" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-23T21:49:47+00:00" title="November 23, 2015  9:49PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Especially given that it's a GMless game, I find some precautions to avoid bleed and keep players comfortable essential:<br/>1.

While being admired, it turned out pretty difficult actually finding players willing to play it like this.<br/>The 2nd edition toned down the more disturbing explicit aspects of the game and made it much more accessible.<br/><br/>Another thing is: Even if you have open-minded players, someone may still be surprised by strong, unexpected emotions coming up. <br/>So, I'm not suggesting turning every game into a PG13 Disney movie. I simply find it responsible to implement some safety measures, allowing people to experiment with a genre in a protected environment.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449729/#Comment_449729" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-24T06:58:45+00:00" title="November 24, 2015  6:58AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BeePeeGee,<br/><br/>I'm going to guess that your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is "Lines and Veils", from Ron Edwards via Sorcerer.

I've actually cut sections to that effect from the rules on Ron Edward's excellent advice, and I think that for this type of game, that was the correct decision. If sales suffer as a direct consequence of that, I'm actually ok with that, because for me, it's more about the integrity of the game itself (and finally publishing it after 11 years). <br/><br/>Your point on the dice is also valid, but at this point the only solution I can think of is to halve the amount needed (so, require the minimum for a single Reaper), and then have all rolls be made sequentially, sharing the same dice, so that Reapers and Bad Guys need to remember their results until all rolls are made and finally resolved. I'm not entirely comfortable with that, because it makes play less streamlined and more clunky, but maybe it's a necessary sacrifice? <br/><br/>On a completely different tangent though, magic missiles hold a special bittersweet sentiment for me. They were the first spell I was excited about with my first D&amp;D character in the first roleplaying campaign I ever experienced. They sounded awesome! I was a sorcerer and was looking forward to blasting holes in bad guys with my bolts of magic awesomeness! And then the game happened, I cast my spell, did 2 damage, not even enough to kill a single goblin, and was left to resort to firing my crossbow for the remainder of the day... That singular experience (also my last) with D&amp;D was what got me so mad that I started making my own games, just so that players wouldn't feel so disenfranchised as I did in my first session. /backstory<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449761/#Comment_449761" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-25T20:16:29+00:00" title="November 25, 2015  8:16PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent story on the magic missile, thanks!<br/>Yeah, so I guess you <i>do</i> get away with less dice usually.
