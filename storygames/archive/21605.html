Some overlap between the two: combat. Once we're rolling for initiative, things like intent and stakes go out the window in favor of the detailed rules of task resolution, and fights turn into swing-hit-HP-damage fightfests. Even basic non-standard tasks go out the window in favor of attack actions. In the majority of cases, that is not how I wish to run the game.<br/><br/>What are some techniques or rules you use to handle difficulties like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472553/#Comment_472553" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-20T17:41:21+00:00" title="April 20, 2018  5:41PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How much hacking or rewriting are you willing to do?<br/><br/>Do you want conflict resolution techniques for the majority of play, or just rare situations?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472554/#Comment_472554" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-20T17:52:59+00:00" title="April 20, 2018  5:52PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two words my friend:<br/>EN VIRONMENT!!!!<br/><br/>bottomless holes, bookshelfs, tunnels, furniture, chains, cauldron, etc etc. write up tags for these and CRUEL I mean ever-lovin' CRUEL tactics for your <del>pretties</del> monsters to use.\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472561/#Comment_472561" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-20T18:07:13+00:00" title="April 20, 2018  6:07PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand your concern in a relatively generic manner - you want to expand the toolset to enable more fluid pacing and more purposeful scene play. There are multiple useful concepts for this kind of thing, more than just one rules innovation. Let's see...<br/><br/><b>One-roll combats:</b> Everybody rolls d20+level+key stat bonus. PCs roll, every named NPC rolls. The side with more henchmen/minions gains advantage. The side with the single highest roll wins. All losers suffer injury equal to 1d6 per full five points in the winner's result; winners suffer 1d6 damage. Henchmen and minions take only 1 point per die, named characters take full damage. A player may choose to "stunt" to halve damage by expending an important tactical resource (a potion, spell slot, whatever); multiple characters may stunt per combat, and one character can stunt multiple times, but every stunt needs to pay more in the GM's judgement than the previous one did.<br/><br/>"Winning" in this sense means that the winning side gets to hold the field, while the losers retreat. Either side may, if unhappy with the result, call to immediately extend the fight, in which case it's resolved to the end with the normal rules, starting at an encounter range chosen by the initial winners. (The initial hefty loss of resources should discourage from this most of the time, such that players will only call to extend a fight when they cannot afford to retreat.)<br/><br/><i>Adding a quick resolution for combats, similar to how skill checks work, should help cut down on time spent in combat. This helps with the big picture, as you can skim less important combat encounters, focusing more seriously on the important ones.</i><br/><br/>I guess I'll write up some more thoughts later, the sauna is calling me right this moment. You'll want, on top of that, to have formalistic means of establishing and resolving strategic goals, both inside and outside combat; the generic conflict resolution rules need to both lead to combat and work within combat, seamlessly.

Our group has in the past, for certain campaigns, spent a good deal of effort on making combat encounters not devolve to "attack is always optimal". I don't think conflict resolution fits well without lots of hacking,  but you might try some of these techniques to see if using them relieves your symptoms:<br/><br/>- Mobile, telegraphed, dangerous environmental hazards. The goal is to make movement actually matter. This is more necessary when tracking squares, less when theatre of mind. All three adjectives are important, and dangerous means actually dangerous, not "you take a tiny or even medium bit of damage". Rapidly flowing lava, telegraphed huge AoE lightning strikes, that sort of thing.<br/><br/>- Goal other than "kill everything", especially one that requires moving around the space. For example "corral the dragon pups" who have wandered into I don't know dire crocodiles or something.<br/><br/>- Time (turn) limits to accomplish non-hitting-things goals.<br/><br/>- Inexhaustible sources of foes. (Obviously need other goals than "kill everything")<br/><br/>- Usable, potent, telegraphed environmental details. All three adjectives are important. Potent means legitimately more effective at achieving goals than just "use attack actions on obstacles until obstacles don't remain then accomplish actual objective". If the usefulness involves removing obstacles otherwise removable via attack actions, the overall effect (including chance it doesn't work if you have to e.g. roll STR) must be significantly better, not just on par, with attack actions, and the players must be pretty confident that's the case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472579/#Comment_472579" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-20T19:56:02+00:00" title="April 20, 2018  7:56PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2018 7:57PM by ValyrianSteelKatana.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>:       <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Do you want conflict resolution techniques for the majority of play, or just rare situations?</p></div></blockquote>\nIdeally, it would be integrated into the combat system itself. Outside of combat, there's no problem, as I've gotten into intent/stakes-setting. It's mostly about ensuring that nobody loses sight of the broader purposes of combat...or that they can do things within combat that are not defined by rolling a d20 vs. AC. In some cases, I'm okay with one-roll resolution per <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen%27s">@Eero_Tuovinen's</a> suggestion, but some of my players are new graduates from the 3.PF school and really, really like things by the book.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">@Guy Srinivasan</a>:<br/><br/>This is a good idea, and tagging them like one does Fate aspects may help everyone keep them in mind.

Basically, I think that D&amp;D's combat system IS a form of conflict resolution... so long as whatever conflict you're dealing with can be resolved via typical combat actions (killing someone, casting a spell, knocking someone out, keeping someone from moving to a certain location, etc).<br/><br/>Are you just hoping to make combat faster, less D&amp;D-like? <br/><br/>If you're familiar with Apocalypse World and PbtA technology, I discuss some seamless ways to "drop" that into D&amp;D here:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19408/a-rather-odd-confluence-of-d-d-and-apocalypse-world-or-a-die-mechanic-late-night-absurdium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19408/a-rather-odd-confluence-of-d-d-and-apocalypse-world-or-a-die-mechanic-late-night-absurdium</a><br/><br/>That may or may not be helpful.<br/><br/>Can you give an example of the sort of conflict you'd like to be able to resolve, and how it would happen in "ideal" play?

Rest assured that we have some convergent evolution going on in our ideas. I wrote before about the idea of rolling a saving throw vs. a hard move, and that is remarkably similar to your ideas. Off-topic a bit, but imagine every roll demanding a saving throw made to avoid some detrimental effect. There was an example offered of the negotiations between PC and goblin king. As an example, test Charisma to negotiate, then test Wisdom to spot the nasty jester sneaking his hand into your pocket. This allows calibration of task difficulty along with modeling conflict resolution in a more traditional framework. I am more comfortable with task resolution myself, so that provides an easy method to bring in partial successes and moves.<br/><br/>TL;DR: we are on the same page.<br/><br/>To respond more directly to your inquiries:<br/><br/>I agree that D&amp;D combat is conflict resolution, it's just made up of many, many small tasks to get to the end point. My hope is to incorporate non-standard tasks into the conflict resolution procedures to make the game more interesting and to encourage the players to stop fighting to the death. Focus on what matters to the PCs, not the hit points monsters have. The purpose is to provide meaning to conflicts in a way not overly disruptive to the mechanics as written. As I said, two players in particular struggle with this idea coming from a 3.PF background.<br/><br/>An example might be the "tavern brawl." The PCs engage some for within a tavern. I want some of them to use bar stools and bottles for their arsenal. I want some to escort patrons to safety. I want the stereotypical dwarf to valiantly guard the kegs from harm. D&amp;D as-is prioritizes focus fire tactics and foe-by-foe elimination to game the action economy. Maximum efficiency and minimum cleverness, roleplaying, or consideration of character concerns. I want this to change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472609/#Comment_472609" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T05:12:34+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  5:12AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on a slighly different page to the two of you, then.

This injection of verisimilitude, I expect, would force players to reconsider their victories, from the ontological binary state of "we won/we died" to the tactical, strategical and logistical space of "what did we actually get by winning" (where winning effectively = holding the field).<br/>That might or might not take on a moral dimension of "what are we fighting these battles for", but is definitely a prerequisite for introducing formal sub-goals to a fight other than killing. It takes an understanding of one's greater goals as a group to weigh options against each other... If the real goal is just to get past the door, I'll consider rushing toward it and/or blasting it to pieces versus killing its guardians: what killing the guards really affords me is "just" my leisure to walk up to the door, tear it down and cross - can I do that anyway? what costs me the least resources? If the actual goal is to drag a cart full of gold back to home base, at times running might be a sounder tactic than fighting - but enemies who are coming for the gold specifically? we need to fend them off.<br/>Of course, introducing Morale Checks for NPCs won't magically make any of the above happen, but I maintain it's a prerequisite - as are Experience Point awarding criteria that <i>don't penalize</i> players for choosing tactical goals other than "Kill 'em all". Then it becomes largely a matter of scenario design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472612/#Comment_472612" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T09:26:13+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  9:26AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2018 9:28AM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also I kinda missed this:      <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Once we\u2019re rolling for initiative, things like intent and stakes go out the window</p></div></blockquote><p>That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want the initiative rolls in there.

Those allow you to rather seamlessly design encounters that have just as much or little of combat as you want.<br/><br/>For example, a bar fight could involve civilian rescue as a side-show: moment to moment part of the party fights and part of the party helps civilians get out of the building. The civilian issue could be handled semi-abstractly by assigning it as a skill challenge of length Y - you need Y successes on skill checks (which skills and how difficult is determined moment-to-moment by interpreting the fiction) to get the whole thing done. Perhaps the civilians pour out of the building on their own at a rate of one per turn, but then there's also the complication of somebody getting stuck under falling furniture, and then the building catches on fire, and there's simply a lot to do on this on top of keeping a lid on the combat situation. Perhaps the opposing combatants make the situation worse unless somebody successfully engaged them in combat turn by turn. Success or failure does not determine who lives or dies among the PCs, like conventional combat, but it does determine how much of a humanitarian catastrophe this situation is, which might be something that the group cares about in the overall story context.<br/><br/>The next-step problem with the 4th edition philosophy is that you basically need to do set-piece railroads if you want all fights to be dramatic in this <i>Thunderbirds</i> kind of way where every specialist gets to strut their stuff and the conflict has twists and turns and complex simultaneous processes. Anything like organic sandboxing is out of the window simply because those kinds of processes cannot <i>guarantee</i> that the fight conveniently has a pleasant balance of non-straightforward cinematic complications.<br/><br/>(There are other ways to solve this than railroaded setpieces, certainly. If you want to, we can explore the options, but it's all going to get pretty far from conventional D&amp;D, pretty fast.)<br/><br/>I recommend adopting some sort of one-roll combat shortcut resolution <i>especially</i> if you also embrace the ideal of a complexly choreographed setpiece combat. That way you can be more flexible about minor events along the way from one set-piece to another; it won't be a big practical problem if there are extra combats you didn't plan for if they can be quickly rolled out of the way in a more freeform way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472646/#Comment_472646" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T21:14:48+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  9:14PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Weeell... it's the glorious oracle of dice <i>and prep</i> after all <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/></p></div></blockquote>\nIf you have a clever way to prep which allows conflicts of interest to resolve in real time without predetermining them... that's pretty cool, but I have yet to see anyone do that successfully. (I've seen a few prototypes/attempts, but I've yet to see someone actually use something like that in play successfully.) You're also limiting yourself, then, to playing out conflicts which you've prepped for - what if two PCs get into a conflict, or they Charm an enemy into fighting with another enemy, or some other, similarly unpredictable, situation?<br/><br/>Non-deterministic resolution of conflicts - e.g. based on a die roll - is the ultimate in "gloracle", unpredictable roleplay, with all kinds of different outcomes on the table all the time. It may or may not suit all games, but it certainly has a time and a place.

Push Persuasion to talk to the guard. Push Stealth to sneak. It creates an interface for players to navigate the game world, but that interface separates them from the fiction.<br/><br/>I also agree that "Less prescriptive more descriptive" is a good way to go about character abilities.

Armor Class is a great example of how the DC system works well, as AC is just a very specific application of the DC system (insert your AC/DC puns here). <br/><br/><div class="Spoiler">Oddly enough, the AC system came before the DC system, but that seems to be how things work in RPG: the specific is created, and a general rule extrapolated from this later.</div><br/><br/>The granularity serves a purpose, and the DCs are set ahead of time so there's really no winging it beyond cover bonuses or the occasional improvised shield. Over the long term of a game involving hundreds of d20 rolls vs. AC, a +1 or +2 to AC <i>does</i> matter, something that has frustrated one of my players endlessly. "What's the point of having a high AC?" he griped after a group of lucky goblins assailed him with arrows. The point is that the additional 20% miss chance that the +4 AC provides is going to save you a lot of pain over the course of a game. If there are 50 attacks aimed at you each doing 1d8 damage, that's 10d8 damage you've avoided. That's useful. <br/><br/>What's less useful is that same granularity applied to the skill check system. For one, how often are characters rolling to run, jump, climb, and typical adventurer tasks? Too frequently demanding a roll results in the bumbling of a Three Stooges skit; too infrequently renders the system totally moot. There's a sweet spot somewhere between the two, but it's one rendered to the sacred mysteries of the dice gods. For another, the entire reason that AC functions with this granularity is that it does not require ad hoc judgments on the GM. "Does this monster <i>feel</i> like AC 12 or 15 or 20?" doesn't exist, unlike in the skill system.<br/><br/>The gameplay produced by this system is often dysfunctional ("the plot demands the PC succeed/fail, so I'll set the DC arbitrarily low/high") or pointless ("there's a dice system, so we <i>have</i> to roll the dice, right?").<br/><br/>This is probably rehashing all things known to present company, but bear with my chattering. It is helpful to get my thoughts written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472916/#Comment_472916" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-25T19:55:17+00:00" title="April 25, 2018  7:55PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, VSK.

A survival roll and the module had the DC fixed at 15.<br/><br/>There were plenty of contested rolls though<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> The session after we had plenty of survival rolls for navigation at the listed DC of 15. We also had some foraging rolls and I was too lazy to look up the real rules so I just used 15. Looking at the DMG I should've used 10 and I also should've allowed more party members to forage. Good that they managed to (barely) survive anyway! A bigger issue was that even at normal pace they can forage, they don't have to go to slow pace.<br/><br/>We also had a situation that seemed perfect for a twelve/twenty. I never force myself to go beyond the binary pass/fail, if I can't come up with a good AW-style "move" then I don't. But here we had just the perfect situation. They wanted to follow someone and I said DC 12 to find them. DC 20 to not get lost. (I.e. under 12 they both get lost and they didn't find them.) That was from the top of my head (and using my "standard" twelve/twenty that I like to use for "success at a cost". In hindsight, finding someone in a six mile hex might be harder than a DC 12 but... since it came at a risk of such a significant cost, I don't think this call was a mistake. And, the party declined to take the risk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
