Awesome? Problems?  Something else?<br/><br/><b>Background: </b> At Gen Con I'm competing in the Iron GM tournament. The default system is D&amp;D 3.5 using OGL content. You may propose alternative systems but your randomly assigned players must unanimously agree. <br/><br/><b>Goals: </b> Trying to pitch Dogs in the Vineyard is too big of a risk but vanilla D&amp;D doesn't speak to my strengths. Instead, I'm going to hack the core OGL system with custom feats to have the system better match my GM style. Additionally, I want to give the adventure a high level feel with medium level characters (5th level). Some of these hacks will make the characters much more powerful than their level would indicate but allow me to throw even crazier challenges at them while avoiding the slowness of higher levels. Some of these feats invalidate existing feats but that's ok (I will make a clear note). <br/><br/><b>Hack \u2013 Momentum: </b><br/><br/>- Every time you fail an attack or skill roll, you gain Momentum Dice: a special colored d6.<br/>- Before any roll, you may spend any number of Momentum Dice, roll them, and add the results as a bonus to your roll.<br/><br/><b>Hack \u2013 Stunts: </b><br/><br/>- After any successful roll, you may spend any number of Momentum Dice to gain bonus effects. <br/>- Effects include: inflicting limited conditions, bonus Move actions, giving allies bonuses to their next roll, and giving enemies penalties to their next roll.<br/><br/><b>Hack \u2013 Players Roll all the Dice: </b><br/><br/>- Not actually a hack but an optional OGL rule: <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/playersRollAllTheDice.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/playersRollAllTheDice.htm</a><br/>- Instead of having Armor Class, players dodge attacks by rolling a d20 plus any normal AC bonuses against a Target Number equal to the opponents' attack bonus +11. <br/><br/><b>Hack \u2013 Monsters: </b><br/><br/>- Monster feats that allow monsters to make reaction basic attacks when a player misses an attack against them.<br/>- Monsters feats that will allow monsters to sacrifice their own Hit Points to make bonus attacks.<br/><br/><b>Hack \u2013 Drives: </b><br/><br/>- Instead of Healing Potions, you may heal yourself using Drives.<br/>- Drives have specific triggers, some combat based, some roleplaying based. <br/>- When you trigger a Drive, you regain a specified number of Hit Points.<br/>- Drives may include winning battles quickly, aiding friends, sneaking past enemies, accomplishing goals, defending your faith, avoiding combat, stealing treasure, swearing an oath, deliver a speech in battle, first blood in battle, delivering a death blow in battle, taking prisoners, defeating sworn enemies, burying and praying for the dead, converting people to your faith, defeating someone who has wounded you, disarming an enemy, forcing your enemy to retreat or submit, turning your enemy to your side, and helping the helpless. <br/><br/><b>What else? </b><br/><br/>I may create a Choose Your Own Adventure booklet similar to the new Essential Starter Red Box where you make a character by playing through a mini story. Many of the above hack options would be unlocked depending on the choices you make. This process would also tie into creating relationships, both friends and enemies!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMcS" title="DanMcS"><img alt="DanMcS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMcS">DanMcS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329406/#Comment_329406" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T11:59:09+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 11:59AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/><b>Hack \u2013 Players Roll all the Dice:</b><br/>- Not actually a hack but an optional OGL rule: <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/playersRollAllTheDice.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/playersRollAllTheDice.htm</a><br/>- Instead of having Armor Class, players dodge attacks by rolling a d20 plus any normal AC bonuses against a Target Number equal to the opponents' attack bonus +11.<br/></blockquote>\nRules note: the version from Unearthed Arcana is in error, the target number should be +12. +11 is mildly easier than normal rules, this may or may not bug your players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329418/#Comment_329418" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T12:27:16+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 12:27PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great catch, thanks so much Dan!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329421/#Comment_329421" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T12:32:00+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 12:32PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've seen <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/sweet20/experience.html" rel="nofollow">Sweet20</a>, right?

I'm totally digging this so far. My only quibble would be with Drives, but only because I'm not sure how well that works. Especially if this is an event, it doesn't seem like non-combat Drives would get much play, unless there's plenty of non-combat stuff going on. I just haven't seen to many tournaments that involve anything OTHER than killing stuff and avoiding traps. For extended, heroic play, though, it'd probably be good.<br/><br/>I would also suggest the simple skill approach: everyone gets a number of skills equal to their starting skill points +Int modifier (no x4 multiplier), and just add the character's level to those skills as the bonus.<br/>...though, now that I think on it, 3.5 really made feats dependent on skill ranks, so that may not work for a high-powered game. But it'd make it that much easier to build a character, at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329444/#Comment_329444" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T14:00:46+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  2:00PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Michael, I haven't scoped out all the skill options yet but I will keep that in mind!<br/><br/>In terms of combat vs. non combat, I'm going to present a sandbox scenario. There is a clear goal and situation, you know you need to go to X and do Y before time runs out but getting there is easy. Before that, you have a map of options you can engage with or ignore as you like to build up your resources for the final fight. So if you want to engage in social negotiation encounters to rally allies, explore for lost treasure, or weaken your enemy by raiding their supply line (plus many more options) you can go wild. How combat oriented it will be depends on the players. But that said, if a drive is too specific, it could be limiting. I'm going to give them an assortment of drives to choose from so that might be an insight into the kind of game they want to play. Especially if I tell them that the kind of game we play completely depends on them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329471/#Comment_329471" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T15:30:18+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  3:30PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You'll definitely need to post how it goes after GenCon.

They're a great set of rules, which are frequently ignored because they're a bit cumbersome to use. Each of them is a little conflict resolution sub-system with scope for interesting outcomes and unexpected twists.<br/><br/>I'm suspicious of system hacks for drifting 3E to a more "story focused" approach. In my experience, these are very difficult to pull off. I think there's an inertia created by players already having pretty firm expectations about how to play D&amp;D, plus it's already a very functional system for creating certain kinds of stories, and it seems to resist change away from that.<br/><br/>One thing you could do is "Say Yes or Face the Dungeon": <br/><br/>Prep two or three smaller dungeons (four or five rooms, with non-linear connections). Maybe throw in a couple of extra encounters as well. Prep a couple of level-appropriate NPCs with generic crunch you can re-skin for a few different character types.<br/><br/>Make pre generated characters with strong goals, or else pre-generate some goals that the players can choose from when they make their characters. Maybe a party goal and a character goal each, like:<br/><br/><b>Party Goals</b><br/>Together, everyone decides on one of the following as their party's goal:<br/><br/>- Rescue the town of Crowriver from a siege by monsters<br/>- Hunt down Roric the Red, an evil Anti-Paladin<br/>- Recover the lost treasure of the Dwarf Queen<br/>etc<br/><br/><b>Character Goals</b><br/>Choose one each. Double ups are encouraged!<br/><br/>- Amass a personal fortune (tell us why you need the money)<br/>- Win glory (what are you trying to prove?)<br/>- Live by a code (what is your code, and why is it important?)<br/>- Get revenge (on who?)<br/>etc.<br/><br/><b>Play</b><br/>Play starts in free play, with the characters trying to achieve their party goal. As soon as they take some concrete step to achieve the goal, say yes, or make them face a dungeon. Either they succeed at what they're doing, or else you find a way to make success or failure depend on them fighting their way through a dungeon. <br/><br/>For example, they're trying to rescue the town of Crowriver. They say "well, we better get there in a hurry, before it's too late." You choose, either they get there in time, or else they face a dungeon. Maybe the fastest way to Crowriver is to go through a series of tunnels through the mountain, but there's a dungeon halfway through.<br/><br/>Or maybe they're hunting down Roric the Red. They need to know where he is first. Either you just tell them what they need to know, or they need to beat a dungeon first. Maybe his old lair is at the bottom of a dungeon, and there might be some clues there about where he's gone to.<br/><br/>In the dungeons, try to bring up things that are relevant to the characters' personal goals. Amassing fortune and winning glory do the work themselves. Every time there's treasure to find or monsters to fight, there's an opportunity for the characters to pursue their goals. Other times, you might need to throw in extra stuff to give the player that opportunity. Depending on your tastes, make the personal goals compliment or contradict the party goal. My preference is that they compliment it.<br/><br/>That's Say Yes or Face the Dungeon. It takes a little bit of improvisation to make your prep fit the story, but it lets you play a protagonist-driven game of D&amp;D while still getting the benefit of prepared dungeons and set-pieces.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329540/#Comment_329540" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T23:03:32+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 11:03PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Dang. Long post. Sorry.)<br/><br/>I\u2019m a little worried you might turn some folks off with too many extra rules. Of course, maybe you\u2019ll also shake lose some of the riff raff? (Rereading your initial post, I see that your players will be randomly chosen, so be careful). Anyway, I\u2019ll keep bringing up an economy of rules throughout this post.<br/><br/>The main thing I worry about is the storing of momentum dice. D20 is not a Say Yes or Roll the Dice system, and not all rolls really count, like in most Story Games.  As a jerky player, why wouldn\u2019t I just spam my least likely to succeed, but highest-iterations-of-to-hit-rolls attack against a monster from afar, then bring home destruction on the following round with all of my saved momentum? Alternatively, you could take long shots and start combats at longbow range from cover. As a player, you\u2019re momentum benefits you more than the NPC\u2019s. Now you\u2019ve incentivized being behind a rock or moving away on a horse in a near endless engagement until your hopper is full of momentum dice. This system seems to reward taking a long time to succeed, during a con situation where you are trying to cover a lot of ground. The ability to cache modifiers is dangerous in a game like this. Remember that D&amp;D is like baseball. You play for the long haul (or the Monty Haul).<br/><br/>You can sort of nerf your way out of this problem by reducing the chances to earn it (one roll per round?), reducing the modifier benefits (see Action Points below), or limit the amount that you can cache. As a limit, consider something based on underused stats like Wisdom and Charisma (or combo).<br/><br/>There is an alternative to your momentum dice that exists in D20 Modern (and maybe some other systems?) called Action Points. You spend them to get little modifiers. You might check it out. <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/actionPoints.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/actionPoints.htm</a>. It\u2019s possible your players will already be familiar with the concept, and you could just change the way they are acquired. It might allow you to sneak in more rules elsewhere.<br/><br/>Finally, I think that you should require narration for all use of momentum dice. I think your stunts idea is much stronger than the raw modifiers. I wish I had thought to give players a mechanical benefit to describing their awesome a long time before playing Burning Wheel and Wu Shu. <br/><br/>Next up, I\u2019m not smart enough to see what the point of Players roll all the Dice is. Can you illustrate what you are going for here? The page you linked points out the benefit that it frees up the GM. Do you need to be doing something else during a fight? Does it require relearning combat and changing the pacing just so you can get a feel of player agency?<br/><br/>IMO, your best idea is Drives, by far. It\u2019s what healing surges in 4E should have been. I like that you don\u2019t require them to have momentum dice to do it. <br/><br/>It sounds like you are going to have a ton of fun. You have some great ideas here. Good luck with running it and make sure you give us an AP. <br/><br/>Simon C. you have some great ideas as well. Maybe the pregen portion could be the list of goals. Players can just pick them, and they can tie into Drives that way. If only you could figure out how to make a game of picking the goals.

Their thing was that you had to spend all your tokens on a single roll.<br/><br/>With your Momentum dice (as Morgan notes), a clever player will be able to spam you with useless rolls up front, then dole out these bonus dice over the course of the rest of the game, which looks and feels (to those watching it who didn't catch on) more like a "standard procedure" that everybody should know. If you have to spend them all when you spend them, it feels more like a reward for having bad luck, there's diminishing returns for each additional token, and there's the additional tension from those times when you could really use some tokens, but you can't really afford to fail rolls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329608/#Comment_329608" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T09:11:31+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  9:11AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I have done for Savage Worlds demos is to award cards from the Adventure Deck (that nifty little deck that adds all sorts of narrative and reward effects to the game), then whenever they actually brought it into the role play they also got a Bennie.

They are actually pretty cool but many people just ignore them since they often have their own unique mechanics and can be a little confusing. I 've bought <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=56883" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=56883</a> which allows very quick and clear access to most of these rules so this shouldn't be a problem (note, these only cover combat useful skills, I had to print out my own notes for non-combat skills).<br/><br/>- The goal of these hacks isn't to make 3E more story focused (although the title says "Story Game" hacks, so completely my fault) but rather make combat faster, less whiffy, and encourage more exciting color. <br/><br/>- I'm also worried that extra rules may turn off players. I'm hoping to introduce all the rules as Feats and stick close to the Feat format so that they are familiar. <br/><br/>- I'm not too worried about players spamming skills (but that's a great point) because: 1. Most monsters will be able to attack back on a miss 2. Time will be of the essence so purposefully failing skills will make later encounters harder and 3. I will make great use of Say Yes or Roll the Dice as to avoid meaningless skill checks.<br/><br/>- Requiring narration for the use of momentum dice sounds cool. What kind of narration do you think works with spending momentum dice?<br/><br/>- Players rolling dodges instead of me rolling attacks gives me less to do which allows me to be a better GM, listen and improvise more. And when I've used it, I've found it is exciting for the players. Making the roll makes them feel like they are actually dodging and participating even when it isn't their turn. And when they get hurt, they seem to take it less personal as they were the ones making the roll, they knew their odds up front, and they feel more in control, even over the pain inflicted upon them!<br/><br/>- I'm tempted by the idea that Momentum must be spent on the next roll or a single roll. I'll have to think about it more and do a bit of playtesting. I like the idea of players gaming momentum since players sometimes love to optimize and find loopholes. The only issue is if the game becomes to easy. Although I'm going to scale their opposition quite a bit since they have extra toys!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329675/#Comment_329675" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T12:14:11+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:14PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>- Requiring narration for the use of momentum dice sounds cool.

Here's a couple other thoughts:<br/><br/>* Call it something other than momentum. If this is about "hitting" or "setting up for someone else," these are "set-up dice." Momentum carries with it other connotations, namely about being centric to the character rolling. (And you may want to avoid "helping dice" because that word is weaker than other choices.)<br/><br/>* If you want to encourage a fast-pace use, they could lose these dice on their next turn. No stockpiling. (Or maybe instead of lose, they have a maximum of one.) Not because stockpiling and unleashing at once is too powerful, but because there's less mental handling time with each moment of "is this when I give away my die or do I keep it for some future round?"<br/><br/>Also, this will make your combats go a bit faster. That's great, if you're prepared for it. You might want to raise the overall DC on foes by a couple points, or prep more material elsewise.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329793/#Comment_329793" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T19:42:46+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  7:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Ryan.

Once for a more story / roleplaying focused group, and once for an overall more tactical focused group (with exceptions).<br/><br/>The three hacks I used:<br/><br/>1. Every time you fail a skill or attack roll, gain a special colored D6. You can spend any number of these D6s to help someone else (even when it isn't your turn) by saying how you help, and then rolling the D6s and adding their results as a bonus to anyone else's failed rolls.<br/><br/>2. No healing potions. Instead you gain hit points by accomplishing character goals or drives.<br/><br/>3. Players roll their defense instead of the GM rolling an attack.<br/><br/>They all worked amazingly. Especially <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> which made D&amp;D 3.5 feel like night and day. Whiffing wasn't painful, you had something to do when it wasn't your turn, and had more reasons to focus on what other players are doing. In both games, it felt like the players were instantly a well-oiled machine of teamwork. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> worked especially well for the more tactically focused group. The only issue with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is it was too powerful. I need to scale down how many hit points you gain. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> helped keep the game smooth and took a lot of pressure off of me as GM while not overwhelming the players and giving more for the players to do when it wasn't their turn. <br/><br/>I have no complaints and couldn't be happier!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331456/#Comment_331456" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T08:00:49+00:00" title="June 24, 2011  8:00AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2011 8:18AM by Wordman.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Instead of having Armor Class, players dodge attacks by rolling a d20 plus any normal AC bonuses against a Target Number equal to the opponents' attack bonus +11.</blockquote>\nIsn't this just the same as saying "Players dodge by rolling a d20 + AC against a Target Number equal to the opponents' attack bonus +21"?

I've mainly been playing D&amp;D 4E but even that has been over a year. I almost feel like it has been so long that my eyes feel fresh when looking and thinking about both games. <br/><br/>Some quick thoughts...<br/><br/>- I actually much prefer that 3.5E doesn't have "encounters" or "encounter powers" (although I still like at will and daily powers in 4E). Combat felt more organic and tied to the fiction. It all just felt more natural and less predictable. <br/><br/>-Making characters in 3.5E is more difficult and time consuming but much more flexible, powerful but also risky (it's easy to make a weak character). <br/><br/>- I like 3.5E's feats better but 4E's class abilities better.<br/><br/>- Tracking status effects in 4E is more difficult except for spell effect durations. 4E ongoing spell effects, save ends, is far preferable to 3.5E's tracking round, minute, or hour durations. <br/><br/>- 3.5E's skills are much more interesting than 4E by far. In terms of variety, detail, and I miss wonderful details like skill synergies. Also comparing the Ride skill in 3.5E to 4E is like night and day. 4E lost a lot of epic feel in some of its oversimplification. <br/><br/>- Special actions in 3.5E like Grapple is a nightmare comparably. But 4E's version doesn't feel like grappling at all. <br/><br/>- Saving throws in 4E rock by far! I like how 2 stats can affect each saving throw.<br/><br/>- Non-lethal damage in 4E is much simpler and easier!<br/><br/>- Monsters in 4E are easier and more interesting to play.<br/><br/>- Treasure in 4E sucks compared to 3.5E.<br/><br/>- 4E combat wasn't much faster. Nowhere near what they advertised. <br/><br/>- I don't like multiclassing in either game but I can see why people prefer 3.5E. I would like 4E much better if you could simply use feats to purchase class abilities from other classes. That would be elegant and a big win. Instead, in 4E they made it so you have to buy a filler feat first and the abilities you buy are downgraded in effect which makes it feel pointless.<br/><br/>- Confirming criticals? Why 3.5E?<br/><br/>- Multiple attacks feels like it slows combat down in 3.5E but it also makes combat feel slightly less whiffy than 4E. It's a draw for me, I could go either way. <br/><br/>- I love how in 4E clerics can attack and heal at the same time. In general it feels like you can do more.<br/><br/>- Positioning and mini combat is more fun in 4E. I like pushing and sliding people around the battle map. But also it's almost impossible not to use the map in 4E.<br/><br/>- 4E's death rules are more fun.<br/><br/>- 3.5E feels more lethal and more satisfying. Healing Surges really take a lot of the drama out of the game. I'd go as far as saying they are a drama killer. <br/><br/>I would say both games have advantages and flaws. But I don\u2019t think I could say that 4E is better. I think it improves a lot but also missed the boat on several key features people love.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331623/#Comment_331623" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T20:45:21+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  8:45PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff.<br/><br/>The confirming crits thing in 3/3.5 *is* actually important, mathematically.  If you ignore it you overpower high-crit weapons and high multiplier weapons.  Also it's weird fictionally--why is the wizard with the dagger critting as often as the dwarven warrior with an axe?  In 4E that's not an issue because with at-wills the wizard is critting with his wand or whatever (and being able to crit on a 19-20 on a weapon is much harder to achieve in 4E IIRC).<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331633/#Comment_331633" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T22:22:42+00:00" title="June 25, 2011 10:22PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From what I can tell, it's mainly there because of keen weapons and feats that enhance the crit range.

Watching a player get excited by rolling a 20 and having that excitement directly translate into irritation at having that 20 wasted (emotionally) when the confirm roll failed killed a lot of the game's energy.

It's good to still have a map sketched out. Basically you just judge if something is close enough to get there in one move action or not. Most of the time people will be engaged in melee or using spells or bows that go well beyond the edge of the battlemat so it's ok. If you want to get more fiddly, have a Movement roll. d20+(move speed/5) &amp; base the DC on distance, but that can get very swingy.<br><br>I've run 3.x without initiative (AW style). There's just something about post 3.x initiative in D&amp;D that just kills me. It completely ruins the fantasy action movie in my head. I think it's one of the few RPG mechanics that I've really grown to, well, no, not hate...resent I guess. Anyway, it works. Just have everyone declare their intentions ("what are you doing") up front, free for all, monsters, too. Then resolve simultaneously. If you really need the order of actions, just go from highest roll to lowest. For example, if Bob the Fighter rolled a 23 trying to hit the orc and the orc rolled a 19 trying to hit Bob, then Bob's hit resolves first.<br><br>Asking questions...why not, I mean, asking questions is the single best thing you can do in any game ever. "So you've got a sword, where did you get it? Is it your father's? How did you come to own it?", "Hey, bard, where did you hear that legend?" etc. Cool stuff.<br><br>Burning Wheel/consequences....eeeeh. I don't think it really works with D&amp;D in any way. The roll's too random, not enough granularity, blah blah. Not sure I can explain, but it doesn't fit the game well. One thing I did do was to apply the "Let it ride" principle however. If they fail, it's a failure until the situation changes and vice versa. It's like a form of conflict resolution. If the Rogue tries to pick a lock and fails, then no, you can't roll that again, the lock's fucked or whatever, your lockpicking attempts are done, try something else. If the Rogue succeeds on that Stealth roll, yep, you get there unseen, no rerolls every 5 meters. <br/><br/>For little village + PC protectors + fronts, check out <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/storming/?page_id=72" rel="nofollow">Storming the Wizard's Tower</a>. It's Vincent's take on Basic D&amp;D and shares a lot with AW in terms of rolls etc. The basic setup is a village with problems and the PCs are the only ones who can deal with them.<br/><br/>I've been trying to "fix" D&amp;D forever and basically what you end up with is either Runequest or Castle Ravenloft. So I think D&amp;D is what it is. It was always very open to retooling and tinkering (less so with each edition, at least on the surface - few people play 4E completely RAW). It's a struggle because I really love D&amp;D but I also dislike quite a few things about it, so it's always about walking the line between embracing the oddities and making yet another shit heartbreaker.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331668/#Comment_331668" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T07:42:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  7:42AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone runs D&amp;D 3.5 or Pathfinder, I highly suggest the <b>System Operational Reference Document</b>!

It also has a massive database of magic items, spells, and feats that are not available on the above SRD websites. <br/><br/>PCGen:<br/><a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/01_overview.php" rel="nofollow">http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/01_overview.php</a><br/><br/>Cool Stuff Inc is a great place to <a href="http://bit.ly/kd4m85" rel="nofollow">buy single D&amp;D miniatures online</a>.<br/><br/>And finally if you are looking for easy solutions for dungeon maps, I enjoyed using the <a href="http://www.gamingpaper.com/adventure_maps.php" rel="nofollow">pre-printed gridded mega-dungeon tiles</a>.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331675/#Comment_331675" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T08:29:39+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  8:29AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we're talking play aids, here's something I made: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/24592325/action%20sheet.png" rel="nofollow">click</a><br/>All the possible combat actions in Pathfinder, on one page, in a 4E-ish layout (sorry about the orientation, just flip it).
