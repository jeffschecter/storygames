It came from the setup.  "What?" you say.  "There's no frozen alien body in the antarctic play set!" you say.  You're wrong.  It's right here:<br/><br/>Relationships -&gt; Soul -&gt; The one's who found the body.<br/><br/>It wasn't me who introduced the frozen alien body it was the two players who shared that relationship once one of them realized that "body" was pretty unspecific.  Hell, I think the first idea was that it was a frozen cave man before they settled on the alien.  In fact, it wasn't even frozen in the ice.  They decided that were scientists on the station and found the alien body in the back of freezer obviously long forgotten by previous scientists.<br/><br/>I had "Isolated coreligionists" on my left and "ecological extremist" on my right.  So me and player to my left decided that we were alien worshipers but had a rift between us.  He believed that science and technology would reunite us with the mother-ship and I believed that we had to preserve the natural vision of the original alien seeders for the planet.<br/><br/>It *was* me who decided to bring the alien to life after the Tilt.  The Tilt produced this: Paranoia -&gt; Someone is watching, waiting for their moment.  I decided that was the alien and now was his moment.  I had first scene in Act 2 and described my character sneaking around one of the labs when the freezer opens and the alien steps out.  I threw myself at my new found god and alas he ignored me.<br/><br/>Instead the alien found the young new research assistant who was pretty emotionally beat up and offered her comfort and love.  Finally the alien went home taking my fellow coreligionist with him.  His Aftermath mainly consisted of moments of his traveling the universe with his alien buddy while the rest of lived out miserable lives on earth.  I ended up destroying everything I'd fought for while driving out into the frozen wastes on snow plow.  The other rational scientist on the station ended up in an asylum.  The young new research girl ended up living out a lonely single life after being heart broken by her lover.  The only other player to have a fairly positive ending was my fellow ecological extremist who switched causes dedicating her life to studying the effect of extreme isolation on antarctic researchers.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267855/#Comment_267855" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T14:36:40+00:00" title="April 19, 2010  2:36PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="src"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267859/#Comment_267859" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T15:14:50+00:00" title="April 19, 2010  3:14PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>His Aftermath mainly consisted of moments of his traveling the universe with his alien buddy while the rest of lived out miserable lives on earth</blockquote>\nHilarious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267867/#Comment_267867" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T17:18:30+00:00" title="April 19, 2010  5:18PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2010 5:18PM by ccreitz.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Jason said, but both hands.
