The game involved a murder on the Seattle docks, a heroin smuggling gangster named \u201cJoe the Plumber\u201d, and a hotly contested union election. <br/><br/>The four characters (all four characters were designed to be PC's, but I only had two players):<br/><br/>Frank: The president of the dockworkers union. Secretly in bed with the mob, who smuggles heroin through the port. A PC<br/><br/>Lance: A Seattle PD Detective. Your classic hard charging cop from central casting. Doesn't like Alice, a nosy crime reporter assigned to the case. A PC<br/><br/>Alice: A nosy crime reporter with a soft spot for the little guy. An NPC.<br/><br/>Joe Kobczek: A Firebrand trying to unseat Frank as dockworker union president. An NPC.<br/><br/>The events:<br/><br/>A security guard at the docks, Mack Allen, was found face down in the bay, with a blunt trauma wound to his head. The police and reporters are called. Frank tries to get Lance and Alice off his back and away from Dock 13, where the heroin is located. Lace sweats Frank. Alice sweats Frank. Frank comes up with a plan to murder Alice, pin the killing on Joe the Plumber, give up the heroin, and sneak away in the ensuing fracas. And he almost succeeds too, killing Alice and pinning the crime on Joe the  Plumber, except that Joe Kobczek outs Frank as a man with mob ties in the middle of a union election debate. Frank is dragged in to the police and confesses to being on the take and knowing where the heroin is in exchange for blanket immunity on everything else (ie, the murder, which the cops still think Joe the Plumber committed). Frank gets what he wants, Lance tries to talk the DA into not giving frank the deal but is rebuffed. Flash forward a year, when we find out Joe Kobczek, now union president, was a communist in his youth in Chicago and knew Mack Allen, who he killed to preserve his secret. <br/><br/>The Good:<br/>The players did an awesome job of motivation and characterization. The murder of Alice the reporter, especially, was awesome player story game goodness.<br/><br/>The system was rules light and easy to use. I liked how the system escalated conflicts from conflict resolution to trait attack (ie, if you don't get your way in a conflict, you can stay in by attacking the other persons stats until they give up or become incapacitated) <br/><br/>The system creates character improvement through character behavior. For example, Characters have a stat, Wrath, that goes up when you torment people weaker than you, and can be used in fighting. Thus, beat up of the weak, and you get a lot of wrath, which makes you more effective, but also says something about your characters morality. It's a clever new mechanic, and one I haven't seen used exactly this way before. <br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>It's also a hard one to train people to use effectively. My players and I had a difficult time remembering to translate character action into character improvement. This was an us thing, not a game thing.<br/><br/>Like all ORE games, this system has a fairly strong whiff factor (in ORE, you roll d10's and look for matches. With less than four in a pool, good luck)  You start the game with a fairly weak character (about four dice in a pool for your <i>good</i> skills), and are expected to use the character improvement system, which moves fairly quickly  (you can gain a stat a scene) to move towards competency. <br/><br/>And all of this would be fine if you used this game 1) as part of a long term campaign and 2) most of the conflicts in the game were against NPC's. Having the main characters start off weak and getting knocked around by the more powerful (ie big name NPC's) until they grow and change enough to knock back is a classic storytelling trope and the weak characters in \u201cA dirty World\u201d are supposed to embody this. However, this requires strong characters for the PC's to knock themselves against. If they're going after villains created by the GM as part of a \u201cparty\u201d style campaign, thats great. But thats not what film noir is about. <br/><br/>If you wanted to recreate, say, \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d or \u201cThe big sleep\u201d as a role playing session, you wouldn't let the PC's play only "the good guys" and have the GM play "the bad guys". To make the most of the setting assumptions, players must be both the heroes and the villains, and thus, Player versus Player conflict must be the center of the game.  <br/><br/>And thats where the game falls down. With starting characters beginning so weak, our session began with multiple dice rolls where NO PLAYER HAD A SUCCESS. It became impossible, as the GM, to adjudicate conflict without demanding multiple dice rolls of the same conflict until someone got a match.<br/><br/>In short, the only worthwhile film noir gaming involves players backstabbing one another right and left, and in the beginning, the only thing the players have to back stab one another with are soggy bananas. I strongly suggest creating beginning characters with far more dice than the text suggests.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179985/#Comment_179985" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T04:44:37+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  4:44AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Kingston, sounds like a fun game. Your point about starting character dice resonates with me as well - I'm thinking for a one-shot a free single point in every Identity rather than just Vigor, and 50 points to spend elsewhere, would fix this.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you use the rule that states the player to the left knows your character's secret? If so, how did it play out? It seems a clever idea for uniting the characters so that wherever they start they have a compelling reason to keep a close eye on each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did the system hold up when Alice was killed? One of the concerns I have is that the system is designed for conflicts where one side is pressuring the other to give in, but doesn't hold up so well when the intention is not compromise but something all-or-nothing, like murder. It seems like you'd have a lot of dice rolls to gun down Alice, shaving, at best, 1 point of Vigor for every successful roll. Combined with the low-dice pools, I wondered if these sorts of conflicts could become overly drawn out. Sounds like it worked well in your case - can you describe a bit more what happened in this conflict?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC" title="KingstonC"><img alt="KingstonC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC">KingstonC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179986/#Comment_179986" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T05:23:34+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  5:23AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adrian P</cite><br/>Did you use the rule that states the player to the left knows your character's secret?

As it turned out, it didn't come up much in play. Without all four characters played by a player, some characters secrets were less compelling than others.\n<blockquote>How did the system hold up when Alice was killed?

I guess if you had a weapon, you could hold your advantage for width instead of dice (instead of taking +1d, you can take an extra level of sucess after the fact, if you already have a success) to quickly whittle down the stats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180017/#Comment_180017" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T09:36:26+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  9:36AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, when I play ADW, the no match thing happens. And yea, at first I had a real problem with it. However, after a bit I switched up my thinking on it, and have had much better success since then. <br/><br/>What I had to do was think of a dice roll as a statement in the fiction, not a task to be passed or failed by the characters. What this means breaks down into a few subpoints. <br/><br/>1) No rerolls of the same task. If you roll to intimidate John into telling you where the Falcon is, and you fail, you can't just roll again. You have to change something about the game before you have another run at him. You could escalate (pull out a gun and beat on him a little, for example), find a new weapon (blackmail papers, something to do with his secret). You could shift the stage (since I can't intimidate him, I have to kill him), but you can't just do the same thing over again. <br/><br/>This helps a lot because it keeps folks from just doing the same thing over and over until they're successful. In most film noir you'll get people trying, failing, and either escalating or moving to a different focus -- but you don't get a lot of scenes of people doing the same thing over and over again when it isn't working. <br/><br/>2) Succeed to no effect. Known in this context as: Take a drag and look away. There is a classic thing in film noir where after an emotional confrontation where someone is trying to get something important a character will take a drag off a cigarette and then look away before "giving in." They say they'll stay away from the bar, they say that they'll get the money, but we know they won't. Much of the time this "give in" is fake, and most of the audience knows it -- even if the characters don't. So when you've got folks on both sides of a conflict who fail rolls, I do this. It looks like one side won or lost, but really nothing much changes. You didn't intimidate them, but they also aren't strong enough to just stand up and tell you no. Or it may look like you drove Mack the Knife off the road and killed him, but really you just banged up his car and he's pissed off. Neither side does what they wanted, but neither side loses either. The fiction changes and moves forward, but nothing at the deeper structural level changed. <br/><br/>Those two points helped a lot with the "no success" problem. <br/><br/>As to killing folks -- yea, its hard to outright kill PCs (at least) in a single go. You'll usually need to beat them at a number of conflicts in a row equal to their Vigor. So when you really want someone dead, you have to fight fucking dirty and kick them until they stop moving. Ugly and nasty, just like it should be. Its worth remembering that you can totally stack "weapon" bonuses too. So when you want to kill someone, get a tommy gun (+3), attack them from ambush (+2), with a bunch of thugs helping you (+2), in their secret hideout where they thought they were safe (+1). Use a couple of those weapons for dice, and then save one or two to add to width, and you're going to tag off a point of Vigor fast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC" title="KingstonC"><img alt="KingstonC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC">KingstonC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180028/#Comment_180028" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T10:37:17+00:00" title="November 24, 2008 10:37AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2008 10:38AM by KingstonC.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand,<br/><br/>Those are terrific suggestions, but any "task succeeds to no effect" type roll, or "cannot do the same thing twice" ruling will extend the length and importance of the conflict, and there are many conflicts who's length and importance I want to downplay. Joe ether hides the key successfully or doesn't, and and having him "almost" hide the key, and dragging the conflict along, makes the key more important than I want the stupid key to be. <br/><br/>In any case, re-reading the text, I suspect my initial problem, that the game is designed with "PC's are protagonists, the GM provides opposition" in mind, while the genre is better served by "PC's are protagonists and antagonists, and provide opposition for one another, while the GM plays minor characters and escalates the conflicts", still stands.<br/><br/>In other words, I wish the game was "In a Wicked Age" with fedoras.
