Collectible games are driven by random boosters, so you have to collect a lot in order to get the cards you want, and usually not all cards are commonly found.  You could buy the pack of bunks and that was all you would ever need.  Same with Once Upon A Time. You can simply by the game (and the expansion if you want to count that) and you'll have all the cards.<br/><br/>It's an interesting idea though.  Would you have different types of decks that you'd need to collect (character, action, quest) or would each card carry all those options? The latter seems particularly interesting, since players would have to choose if they want to use a card on their character or save it for an action.  You could also have a mechanic where defeating quests gets you the card (although not permanently, or GMs would be hard to come by and they'd be reluctant to use good cards), basically working like experience and treasure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126933/#Comment_126933" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T13:45:51+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  1:45PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2008 1:47PM by Ry.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D - crossed with Red Box Hack's arena movement system - is what had me thinking of this, but not the supplements so much as the structure of the game.  <br/><br/>I mean, if you could <br/>express characters and monsters abilities entirely though feats (collapsing other subsystems into feats) <br/>boil off all the extraneous stuff (and I have a way) beyond "add Stats and roll high"<br/>have some oracle-like "premise cards" and some "arena cards"<br/><br/>Then I could imagine an OGL game with these kinds of cards:<br/>Character (Face + really basic stats)<br/>Character Feats <br/>Treasure<br/>Monster (basic stats)<br/>Monster Feats<br/>Arena<br/>Oracle<br/><br/>You could pull off of so much OGL material if you wanted to.  <br/>It just doesn't seem that hard to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126937/#Comment_126937" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T13:49:06+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  1:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arcadia definitely fits the bill to my mind, it was almost impossible to play without turning it into a sort of RPG, because you create a character like an RPG, and then have goals, and plans, and quests, and opposition, and you really feel that you are playing that character.

You tell a story, trying to get rid of your story element cards, and other players can grab control and take over telling the story by playing one of their story element cards if you mentioned something that fit the content of the card. (i.e., they have a "Wedding" card, and you say the prince and princess got married, they can take control). If you use up all your story element cards, you can play your one ending card and win the game.<br/><br/>There's a Japanese RPG called <a href="http://www.bouken.jp/product/makeyou/index.html" rel="nofollow">Meikyuu Kingdom</a> where the various crunchy bits (skills, items, monsters, etc.) are represented as cards that you can either photocopy out of the rulebook or buy (and thereby get in full color) for about 1500 yen.

As I was curious, I preordered some cards. I'll be able to tell you more when the game is out.<br/><br/>It's not realy a rpg but you have (and I check your list) :<br/>- Character (Face + really basic stats) (one character for one player).<br/>- Character Feats<br/>- Arena<br/><br/>I am not sure for the treasures and monsters part and the arenas don't seem as good as in the RBH. You buy the characters in characters pack and there are separate adventure decks. There's no GM. It's all PvP (one versus one or two versus two, I think).<br/><br/>What seems clumsy is that there's still dice involved. You build your character with cards but you test abilities, roll damages, etc... with dice.<br/><br/>You can have a lot more details on the site.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Antoine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127356/#Comment_127356" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T16:37:16+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  4:37PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Corunea</i> sort of reminds me of <i>Anachronism</i>:  Arena battles between (quasi) historical characters.  Each character is a card with his stats, and he has four other cards that are his equipment, which can be brought into the duel in certain ways.  Backup cards can be switched between characters to make ahistorical combinations, which can be fun.  Your character cards actually move around the arena grid, showing each character's tactical position and facing.  I always thought that it would be an interesting hack to add creatures or mobs of enemy footsoldiers for the characters to fight.  At that point, we're halfway to an RPG...<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127860/#Comment_127860" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T20:26:59+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  8:26PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 8:32PM by E.T.Smith.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something that came close was <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/11460" rel="nofollow">Throwing Stones</a>, which was a collectible <i>dice</i> game. You'd buy a tube of dice, which I think had six or so cubes in it, and choose four of those dice to build a starting character. The dice were specially printed with various symbols representing different abilities, and I think certain dice were considered representative of certain classes of abilities. Thus you could build a mixed character with two 'warrior' dice, I 'red magic' die and 1 'scout' die, for instance. Or just 4 ' warrior' dice to keep it simple. Obviously, you needed to own the right dice to manage certain character builds, which encouraged buying more tubes. Character growth was, I think, a simple matter of adding more dice to your character. Never played it, and though I thought the simple modularity of char-gen was quite clever, my impression was that keeping track of the dozens of different made-up symbols would have been a pain.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://images.boardgamegeek.com/images/pic46450_md.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
