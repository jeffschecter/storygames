The question is: are they too complex to manage? The inventory sheet I made pretty much does all of this <em>for</em> you. Doing the following by hand could be a pain?</p><h2 id="the-area">The area</h2><p>You need any ruled area (like the dinky little equipment area on most character sheets) or just a hand made bullet list on scrap paper or w/e. I\u2019m going to use the word \u201cslot\u201d for these rows/list-entries/bullets.</p><h2 id="the-number">The number</h2><p>Take your armor and divide it\u2019s pound weight by five, round down. Subtract that number from your strength score.</p><p>That\u2019s how many items you can carry.</p><p>Block that many slots out right away. (Draw a bold line on your ruled paper, or make that many bullets in your hand drawn list, or w/e.)</p><p>(Holy shit that\u2019s too few?) Mark yourself as <strong>Encumbered</strong> (-10 speed) to add your strength score to that.</p><p>You can do this once more and go to <strong>Heavily encumbered</strong> (-20 speed and disadvantage on all physical rolls).</p><p>Having a backpack is presupposed, pay for one if you\u2019re buying your own gear.</p><h2 id="the-catch">The catch</h2><p>You can not have more big items than small items. Your big items and your small items need to cancel out.</p><p>Keep track of your small items with a \u201c-\u201d and your large with a \u201c+\u201d in front of them.</p><p>If you would ever add a big item and you don\u2019t have enough small items to cover it, mark another empty small slot right away with a - on an empty line.</p><p>Size categories: <div class="Spoiler">I use the same size categories with this rule that do for my inventory sheet.</div></p><p>Tiny items: You\u2019d put it in your pocket. One coin, one gem, one candle, one piton, or such. Around 50 per lb.</p><p>Small items: You\u2019d put it in your bag. Lanterns, flasks, tinderboxes, messkits, or such. Around 1 lb.</p><p>Rations: One ration counts as two small item. Is an annoying exception to the normal categories. Around 2 lb.</p><p>Medium items: Weapons, shields, bow+full quiver, or such. Around 5lb.</p><p>Big items: tents, bedrolls, blankets, 50ft rope, one-gallon-waterskins or such. Around 9lb.</p><p>Heavy items: One these five items: pike, maul, greatclub, heavy crossbow, two-gallon-waterskin. Another annoying exception. Around 15 lb.</p><p>So to put a big item you must also have a slot occupied by a ration, small item, or tiny item.</p></div></div></div></div></div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475448/#Comment_475448" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T19:30:07+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  7:30PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is clever as well, but I have to ask: what is your thinking on just tracking equipment weight and dimensions by real weight? (That is, approximate simulated weight, determined in the same way you determine any measures in the game.)<br/><br/>I ask because real weight tracking is what I do, and I have to say that it has all the features I want of a fiction-oriented, challengeful D&amp;D. Most importantly, it meshes well with the other systems and procedures of the game. Every time I consider using one of these abstracted systems, I shy away because while I can appreciate the gamifying, ultimately these seem to add complication and distance from the action rather than lessening them.<br/><br/>The one undeniable advantage that simpler systems have is that nobody at the table needs to know how much a tent weights - nobody even needs to guess - if you don't use real weights. However, that is a narrow advantage, easily lost: seems like a more complex encumbrance system, such as yours, is no easier, as now you need to be able to sort the equipment into these weight classes, which you can't do without knowing whether a tent is a "medium" or "large" or whatever. And if you do know that the tent weights e.g. 20 pounds, then you might as well just write that down instead of correlating it with a weight class that you track.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475449/#Comment_475449" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T19:52:15+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  7:52PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2018 8:02PM by 2097.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h2 id="probs-with-tracking-at-the-lb-granularity">Probs with tracking at the lb granularity</h2><p>We played with tracking real (approx sim) weight for four years and moving away from it has been so nice.</p><p>The number <strong>one issue</strong> is that most modules don\u2019t have weights listed for items! And even in the PHB it\u2019s a chore to look things up.</p><p>The <strong>second issue</strong> is that the backpacks are supposed to only carry 30 pounds, but the pregen backpacks contain more than that? The universal solution seems to be to allow some things to be strapped to the bag. With the inventory sheet, esp current version, it\u2019s easy to know <em>where</em> things are, not just how many they are.</p><p>The <strong>third issue</strong> is that players were lax AF on it. They were overencumbered all the time. And doing an audit was a complaint-laden, miserable affair. And also I\u2019m not the best at keeping numbers in my head so I would lose count and start over trying to audit.</p><p><strong>Corollarily</strong> to that third issue is that it\u2019s so nice commit to carrying a certain amount of slots, and then having free reign with those slots, being able to pick things up without worry as long as the slots aren\u2019t all full, and to erase things from there by dropping. It\u2019s like \u201cI can play without worry as long as I\u2019m within the fence\u201d. And that has really worked very well.</p><p>The <strong>fourth and most important issue</strong> is that it leaves me clueless to the two big questions: do they trigger pressure plates (i.e.\xa0how much do they weigh) and can they drag each other out of there (i.e.\xa0how much more can they exert themself + how much does their friend weigh). I can\u2019t hardly be like \u201cok so exactly how much are you carrying right now?\u201d and trying to pokerface it that they just stepped on a trap.</p><h2 id="solutions-to-those-problems-while-still-doing-lb-granularity">Solutions to those problems while still doing lb granularity</h2><p>Now\u2026 my <em>experience</em> alone by using my inventory sheet for months would solve the first issue regardless of system. Now I have really strong guidelines for 0.02, 1, 2, 5, 9 and 15 lb items. They find a book it\u2019s 5lb. They find a candle it goes among the coins. I didn\u2019t have that before, and the inventory sheet has\u2026 sort of given me that? Its spatial categorization makes it work. Like it helps me remember what heavy tomes weigh because I\u2019d know where they would\u2019ve gone on the inventory sheet.</p><p>The second I don\u2019t know how to deal with</p><p>The third issue could be solved by having carrying capacity be a value, like HP. Strength times five. You pick something on, or don something, and you subtract it from your CCV. You drop something, you add it to your CCV. You decide to go encumbered, you can add 5\xd7str to your CCV, and once more to go heavily encumbered.</p><p>The corollary to the third issue was just as important, though, and it\u2019s also left unaddressed by the CCV idea.</p><p>And by always always trying to stay on top of their CCV I can devise some convoluted formula to address issue four. But it\u2019s annoying to do math with that fine granularity and it\u2019s hard to stay on top of all the tiny little things they do every day. Scratch food, strike arrows, pick up some rando corpe\u2019s pocket trash etc etc.</p><h2 id="this-threads-ops-solutions-to-those-problems">This thread\u2019s OP\u2019s solutions to those problems</h2><p>Well, uses the same size categories as my sheet. It doesn\u2019t have the \u201cspatiality\u201d as a learning aid though.</p><p>The second issue, well with this thread you\u2019ll have to forget the 30lb-backpack rule. However, the \u201cone coin per line\u201d rule still makes it meaningful to have sacks and pouches when you find that dragon\u2019s hoard.</p><p>The third issue, especially the corollary, you block out that many lines.</p><p>The fourth issue\u2026 the formula is a little more convoluted but you could have the player\u2019s bw/5, their strength scores, and their current \u201care you encumbered?\u201d status and be good to go.</p><p>That said, I\u2019m not sold on this new method compared to the sheet</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475452/#Comment_475452" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T20:03:34+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  8:03PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, that all makes sense to me - a nice outline of the reasons to look for into a more abstracted encumbrance system.<br/><br/>My solution to the player tendency to be lax about inventory is to throw the responsibility to them and just ask them for the facts when I need them. So I'll just ask whether they're encumbered or not when necessary and assign penalties on the basis of what they tell me. (I will obviously tell the players what stuff weights and so on if they ask me for help.) This works for me creatively because it moves the issue of how precise to be in the counting, and how to count, and so on, to the players, where it belongs: they will only ever be encumbered when they themselves judge so, which suits me just fine.<br/><br/>I'll note that this works for me symmetrically - I also prefer player-side encumbrance tracking when being said player. I can do the tracking with precise elegance, wasting exactly as much effort as it merits from adventure to adventure, and make sure that the GM doesn't get lax about factoring encumbrance, as they're wont to do. If the GM encourages us to ignore encumbrance except when the GM makes equipment-checks, that's clearly a weaker system than letting me carry responsibility for my own tracking.<br/><br/>Just an idle thought on the matter, that. A more gamified system clearly helps with the issue of responsibility as well, but in a completely different way: by using slots and such you make it harder for the players to pay lip service to encumbrance. You're either over the slot limit or you're not, and it's cheating if you're over and don't tell the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475455/#Comment_475455" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T20:23:12+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  8:23PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>My solution to the player tendency to be lax about inventory is to throw the responsibility to them and just ask them for the facts when I need them.

The slot limit makes it so binary<small>(well, ternary with the three encumbrance levels)</small>. You can pick up stuff, drop stuff, use up potions, shoot arrows, find arrows, find gold, etc etc etc without counting! And you\u2019ll see right away when you\u2019re up against the fence.</p><p>It\u2019s not that players <strong>want</strong> their PCs to carry too much. It\u2019s that it\u2019s <em>such a hassle</em> to track weights at the lb granularity.</p><p>In the past, I advocated for the lb granularity saying that \u201cit\u2019s no different from HP, everyone can keep track of HP so why not lb?\u201d. But that\u2019s wrong. With HP, you don\u2019t have to remember that the sword bonk from gobbo nr three was 7 damage. But in the lb granularity, you have to note the weight with every item. So you can regain the carrying capacity when you drop it.

It's sort of a shame that our on-going Prydain 4th edition game doesn't really care about encumbrance; a video game equipment interface would be exactly the sort of stuff this campaign thrives on. As it is, I just ended up putting up a video game style paper doll with magic item slots indicated so the players can write in which items they're using in which slots.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>However, that leaves issue four.

My free-wheeling does get a slight bit messy with those situations. What I have to do is that I ask the player for the character's total weight (which they will calculate/guesstimate in real time if necessary) and then use that in the process. It does reveal to the players that something weight-related is going on, but that part of it I handle the same way I do with perception checks and all that kind of thing: if I feel that the character doesn't know that something's going on, the player needs to pass a perception check or similar to justify it before their character can get smart about it. Sometimes the player knows that there's a pressure plate, but the character doesn't, so they'll go on their merry way. Most experienced players know and understand about the meta-gaming issues and simply police themselves.<br/><br/>(I call this whole approach "messy" because it causes an explicit occurrence of meta knowledge that has to be managed, and because it's vulnerable to long-term causal events: it gets pretty annoying when a character doesn't know something important for a long time, and the player therefore has to account for that lack of knowledge for potentially several scenes.)<br/><br/>The difficulties can be managed, of course: query players early and often and vaguely, and they won't know what piece of data it is that you need, and whether it's important. Sort of like fake-out rolls to hide actual secret rolls when the timing of the roll is an imperative detail.<br/><br/>Ultimately it's a known fault of the form, though; I am not aware of a true superior solution to how to simultaneously use character players for parallel processing while accessing their data slots without letting the players observe the GM's read head poring over the record surface. You either take the character sheets away and calculate everything yourself, or you accept that sometimes the players know what data you're using and when. Maybe when we move having everything digital it'll become realistic to spy on character sheets without having to actively ask the player to hand it over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475462/#Comment_475462" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T20:52:31+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  8:52PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spoiler for modules<br/><div class="Spoiler">50 lb seems to be the most common but I see 200 often enough<br/><br/>We've also had sub 50 lb pcs.

Maybe a hobbit is light enough to not trip the pressure plate? Same might go for a goblin - maybe they intentionally build their traps to not trip at goblin weight...<br/><br/>Around here PC demihumans are rather rare, though, but the opposite conceit is very much a going concern: one of the basic trap-resolution strategies in the local scene is using dummies (some sort of rolled weights) or canaries (living animals, etc.) to trip traps. Knowing how much weight a pit trap or creaky rope bridge takes becomes a rather useful thing in these circumstances, as the players' plan might fail if their trap-tripping solution is too heavy or too light for the situation.<br/><br/>These are advanced concerns, of course; they come up if they do, and if they don't you can get by a long time without having to think about them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475464/#Comment_475464" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T20:58:59+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  8:58PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, thanks!<br/><br/>"Dragging" definitely seems like a more relevant concern.
