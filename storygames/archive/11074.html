For example, one read...<br/><br/>JOTUNN<br/>-- the Valkyrie Squadron promised to honor the ghost of the fallen giantess<br/>-- the Glorious Dead of the Valhall are currently inhabiting the bodies of the dead giants<br/>-- the dead giants are still mad at Odin<br/><br/>Then, like with player Keys in TSOY and its descendants, I as GM can try to hit some of these Keys when the players choose to have their characters visit that bit of setting or interact with people there.  Basically, they provide a way for me to prep situations without necessarily prepping specific NPCs or conflicts, because I don't really know how the players are going to choose to interact with stuff. In play, they decided to burn the giants bodies, so I had the Glorious Dead step out of the smoke arrayed for battle, assuming that Ragnar\xf6k was at hand (again?!) and it was time to kill giants. Ha!<br/><br/>Since we're using Mouse Guard, the rules also give me cool ways of interacting and developing these "GM Keys."  If I decide that there needs to be a Twist as the result of a failed roll, but can't come up with one immediately, I can mark the situation it applies to with an X and remember to escalate or develop a new conflict out of the old conflict in between sessions, so it comes back to bite characters in the ass.  For example, there's currently XX on "part of the Glorious Army carves a bloody swath through the criminal underworld of the Undercity."  Can't wait to see what comes from that!<br/><br/>Also, if players address situations in play, I generally cross them off.  Between sessions, then, I get to decide if entire Keys are basically resolved (that location / faction doesn't really have any more mileage left) or if new situations and complications will arise out of the remnants.  Sometimes, as in <i>Mare Caspium</i> (or, come to think of it, <i>Danger Patrol</i>), I escalate situations that were not addressed previously or merge a few previously unconnected situations together, contracting the web of relationships a bit tighter. Several times, I've looked at the cards after play and been like "Hmm, the reason nobody addressed that situation is because it's lame" and crossed things that weren't working right off the list.<br/><br/>Finally, the set of GM Keys serves as a kind of geographically distributed record of play, as well as being a set of campaign notes that are actively used at the table, rather than simply being pages of backstory.  Generally, because the cards generate way more situations than we'll ever address directly in play, they allow you to follow players' interests as well.  If the players dive right towards one GM Key and ignore the others, that's cool.  You can keep adding and resolving situations on that Key and one or more related Keys.  Nothing says that, because you wrote a Key, that you and the players have to hit it.  Basically, the Keys set out the general boundaries of the campaign or story arc, the stuff that you're interested in exploring, but the specific choices remain up to you and the other players.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've been finding this technique super useful and wanted to share.  I'd write a little short game to show the technique off, but it's finals week coming up.  Grad school may limit me to hacking other stuff for a while, which is fine with me, honestly.  That just means you can get playing faster <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245659/#Comment_245659" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T00:58:21+00:00" title="December  8, 2009 12:58AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of developing/escalating the keys in between sessions.<br/><br/>I imagine you could also have GM achievements - meta-goals to help you focus on what you want to do with the game. "Give player X that immersive scene he really needs", "Deepen the setting descriptions", "Get at least one character nearly killed in combat for extra drama"... Then you could buy yourself a candy bar for each achievement afterwards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245664/#Comment_245664" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T02:15:04+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  2:15AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like how I write scenarios, as well as creating themed handouts whose purpose is disovered through play. I also look at what the players are doing and saying, and use that to guide further development. Sometimes they write the backstory for you.<br/><br/>It's a bit like the way you discover London. At first it is a set of isolated spots around tube stations, then, as you explore, you find out how these places link together, geographically as well as historically and thematically and then you get to see them more as part of a whole until huge swathes of the map fall into place. But there are still bits, like Upminster or St John's Wood, that are just names on the map, with no meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_245665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245665/#Comment_245665" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T02:20:38+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  2:20AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds very nice, Jonathan!

That's an interesting thought.  The closest I can see myself coming is something like: "Press player X until they are forced to make a decision about issue Y."  That's a bit OOC, but still focused on the fiction.<br/><br/>Steve, yeah, I'm basically trying to systematize the way I normally approach session planning and notetaking, to make it easier to do the stuff I already try to do.<br/><br/>Hans, glad you find it helpful.  I'm just developing this into a set of techniques now, so I'm not sure about best practices yet.  Generally speaking, I don't think I would ban the players from seeing most of the cards, but they're not open in front of everyone on the table right now (though I can imagine different campaigns where they would be).  Right now, they just sit in front of me like the GM's version of a character sheet.  They're open, but it's not like John or Lesley are constantly looking over my shoulder to see which cards I'm writing on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
