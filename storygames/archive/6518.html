I think we all do, but we'll probably get mired down in debate about it anyway. Let's just say that we're playing, um, Traveller and we're all really jazzing on exploring the galaxy (as characters) and exploring our own idea of good science fiction (as players). We're jazzing on exploring those worlds that the Referee made, exploring the politics of this Hegemony thing, and so on. And the mechanics are really explicitly Sim stuff. The mechanics are supporting and furthering our enjoyment of this exploration by giving us tools, or at least opportunities, to say to each other, "No, no, that's not right. The Hegemony isn't like that," or "No, no, that's not right. A binary system couldn't have an Earth-class planet with such a small orbit. It'd get fried." <br/><br/>And, somehow, it's that kind of constructive denial that we do over and over in the game that lets us Address Premise -- that is, it lets us make some kind of point about something important to us, thematically. Because while we care a lot about the fidelity of the physics and the believability of the in-game politics, our debate about those things doesn't make a point about anything outside the game. We're arguing about what is right (true), not about what is Right (moral).<br/><br/>El Dorado is the hypothesis that playing Sim can't give you Nar results. I don't think this is really that surprising or even disputed.<br/><br/>Partly, I think the whole El Dorado term is a bunch of useless crap because it is illogical jibber-jabber. It's like saying that steak-producing techniques cannot produce clock radios. Who is arguing that? Why do we need a term for a straw man concept that has no proponent (as far as I know)? Sim play is not Nar play. If you're doing explicit Sim play, you're gonna get Sim play, not Nar play. Duh.<br/><br/>Because this makes so little fucking sense, people have subverted it to talk about something that does make sense: the possibility of techniques that produce a consistently fun hybrid of Sim/Nar play, either at the same time or alternating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144565/#Comment_144565" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T15:06:11+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  3:06PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e34gPtuJYJI" rel="nofollow">Eldorado</a>.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144584/#Comment_144584" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T17:14:02+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  5:14PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite></blockquote>\nI'm reading this, but I am not understanding.

A simulationist agenda is going to run life the same way - with bugger all story/thematic questions happening. You'll be spending alot of time just spending alot of time, just like real life. You will get thematic questions sometimes, as you do in real life, but it wont be consistant (as the definition notes).<br/><br/>Narrativist play, I like to think, is an abomination to simulationism. It screws up causality without even a second thought, if there's even a hint it can fit yet another brooding issue in there. Ie, someones brother was dead - but bam, someones wife loved him - bam, bring him back to life to pressure that marriage. He's not alive cause he would have survived somehow, he's alive just for the sake of that questionable situation.

What a jerk I am.</blockquote>\nYet another reason to switch to the <i>AGE Model</i>.  <a>Come on in, the water's fine!</a><br/><br/>Sim?  We don't need no steenkin' sim!<br/><br/>The problem isn't with Sim v. Narrative - the problem is with carving Sim out as this extremely narrow band of possible play.  As humans we use narrative as a tool for making sense of the world around us - our brains don't make neat divisions between 'this is how the world is' and 'this is the story of my life'.  Which is why it would, in all likelihood, be impossible to create a game that addressed only Sim - the world we explore is inextricable with the story of how that world came to be, or role in it, and the stories, histories, ologies, philosophies and so on that went into it.<br/><br/>With the AGE Model, I've re-addressed the ball, so to speak.  Play of an RPG (and the design of an RPG) is a continuum between Emulation (the desire to recreate some experience with the game) and Art (the desire to express oneself through the action of the game).  The balance between those two poles is negotiated using a rules structure - the Game.  <br/><br/>By looking at play like this, it's easy to see that El Dorado is a mirage.  A Star Wars game, for example, is about not just experiencing the Star Wars Universe (the Sim take), but experiencing an authentically Star Wars saga - getting the setting, the plot. and most importantly the <i>feel</i> right (the Em take).  Meanwhile, players want to tell not just <i>a</i> Star Wars saga (Nar), they want to tell THEIR Star Wars saga (Art), and to give themselves legitimate agency in the Star Wars milieu through the play of a Star Wars game.<br/><br/>So there you go.  El Dorado is so difficult to reach because the Big Model creates an artificial divide between theme (Premise) and experience (Sim).  People expect both simultaneously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144641/#Comment_144641" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T06:39:56+00:00" title="May 17, 2008  6:39AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the help, everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144646/#Comment_144646" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T08:25:33+00:00" title="May 17, 2008  8:25AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because I was an asshole up there, let me make something clear. I believe we need to do more to make the theory we use accessible to new folks. That is, we need a single document that lays out the entire Big Model and the main terms in an easy-to-follow way. It would not include every single term in the Provisional Glossary though, because that would grow to be about the size of a book, then it would cease to be useful as a quick-start document.<br/><br/>Also, terms like El Dorado are so far down in the mire of the theory that they're not even that useful to us theory wonks. I consider "El Dorado" to be <i>work product</i>, and not the end result. It's no longer useful for most theory discussion. I think the Big Model has progressed past the point of usefulness for that term.

For once, in BM Theme is not Premise, but unless I've totally misunderstood BM (which is entirely possible) that sentence is just...wrong. Sorry Brian, I hope you haven't founded your AGE model on it - I've downloaded that and will give it a read through of course, as I haven't heard about it before.<br/><br/>Please don't let my remark ignite a BM mud shovelling contest - but I'm with Adam here. For one, BM is a fucking useful tool to describe and understand what happens when we play games, why we do it and why we do it the way we do. Some people did try to make it more accessible, like Vincent and Ben, and Clyde is podcasting about it, but yes, a quick guide to the damned thing and ESPECIALLY what it's useful for and what it isn't.<br/><br/>Carry on <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144779/#Comment_144779" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T04:40:05+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  4:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2008 4:42AM by Marco.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth: I think El Dorado is easily and trivially realizable in every meaningful sense.

Like: historical, eh?<br/><br/>El Dorado, back in the day, was something people wanted. Now: you can say they wanted to play some kind of game where story "just magically happened" and that wasn't real likely*--and that's fine. But I was in a lot of those conversations and it was a <b>lot more</b> about a division between the primacy of exploration and immersion (although that was a problematic term, even back then) vs the primacy of intentional story generation (The term "fit characters," for example, didn't come around until later).<br/><br/>Today, it's *still* something people want (see Mike Holmes actually engaging with it pretty recently) and, because of a variety of reasons, either don't know how to get or think is impossible to get.<br/><br/>Whatever it is you like about "The Right to Dream" is covered under the umbrella of Narrativist play. All it takes is some (very basic) structure. <i>That's</i> El Dorado--that's satisfying both Sim &amp; Narrativist agendas. <br/><br/>Now, "explicitly Sim play" may be taken to mean "without doing any work before the game" which is fine if you want to argue about definitions but in do so, you're missing the point*. The point is that what Brian (Kuma) said up there is pretty much right. Most people using GNS to try to say anything make way too big a divide between whatever they think it thinks Sim is and what it thinks Nar play is--and usually along the lines of making the mistake that exploration + more exploration somehow excludes address of Premise (which for a lot of people it seems to because they don't approach that with a solid framework).<br/><br/>-Marco<br/>* note that the term "explicit Simulationist play" can apply correctly to the actual play of the game--leaving out the prep--making trying to apply the definitions meaningless. I can do whatever prep I want and get "explicit X play" of any sort. If you do all that prep you can <i>still</i> get Sim-play or Gamist Play or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144880/#Comment_144880" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T11:18:46+00:00" title="May 19, 2008 11:18AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wasn't in those conversations, so I'll happily bow to your interpretation of what El Dorado was to people then.<br/><br/>To replay back to you what you said so that I can be sure I understand: El Dorado was about getting Story Now (Narrativist play / Address of Premise) while maintaining immersion.<br/><br/>I read "explicitly Sim play" as either (a) play that is Simulationist (meaning recognizable as such over an entire cycle of play) or (b) play that uses techniques recognized as Sim's techniques and not some other CA's. If it's (a), then it's just an arbitrary category thing. You can't have Sim play that is Nar play because the categories are mutually exclusive. You can have a hybrid, sure. If it's (b), then there's some confusion of category. Techniques aren't CA. You can use all the "Sim techniques" you want and never get Sim play, or always get Nar play. Because there really aren't "Sim techniques." Sure, some techniques seem to be better at getting one kind of play or another, or they'd be useless as techniques, but they don't define the Creative Agenda. To my thinking, immersion is a technique, not the tell-tale of Simulationism. <br/><br/>I doubt it will be of any surprise to you that I don't agree that "...'The Right to Dream' [Simulationism] is covered under the umbrella of Narrativist play." What I like about Sim play is "getting it Right." That goal is fundamentally different -- and often at odds with -- the goal of Narr play to Address Premise. <br/><br/>Before I open my mouth at the gaming table, I've filtered my creative input through a filter. Call it Creative Agenda or whatever, it doesn't matter. I have a few different filters and they include "this isn't Right," "my point is this," and "who's the big man now, eh?" Occasionally, the planets align and two or even three of those are in conjunction: I can satisfy all three filters when I add my creative input to the game play. Such alignments are rare and fleeting and hardly consistent. <br/><br/>El Dorado, as defined, is using <i>only</i> the "this isn't Right" filter and somehow ending up with play that pushes all the buttons that get pressed when I use only the "my point is this" filter. <br/><br/>What I'm hearing people say, though, is that they want to use certain techniques (not filters) and get Narr play. That's fine. That is possible. People have been playing "Vanilla Narr" D&amp;D for a long time by doing just that. They're still using Narr filters though. You're not going to get Premise without filtering for it.<br/><br/>And I disagree that Sim is just "exploration + more exploration." It's exploration that prioritizes "correctness" of some kind over all other things. CA is always about priorities, and that's why the three recognized Creative Agendas are often considered mutually exclusive: you can't have two <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> priorities. You can have hybrids, but they mean having some kind of weird priority scheme and letting play bounce around. Not a bad thing, necessarily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144888/#Comment_144888" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T11:57:52+00:00" title="May 19, 2008 11:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience says that at one point the Sim and Nar preferences will clash definitely and the players have to choose and can't do both at the same time all along.

It depends on what come first in line - if Nar is first in line and Sim second, sim will be made to compromise at some point in order to support nar.

I've seen some good games come out of a group applying a very "strict sim" approach to play, while allowing one or more members to inject the Nar stuff into the game.<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>--Front-load thematic situation, fit characters, etc, then leave play to be entirely "sim", exploring the consequences<br/>--Have one player (the GM) inject Nar/thematic material into play, while the other procedures of play, and the mode of operation of all the other players appears to be strict "sim"<br/>--Have most players working within a context of Nar priorities, trying to create theme and story, while one (the GM) arbitrates the whole thing from a strict "sim" perspective ("what would happen", etc)<br/><br/>I do realize that there is some mangling of the theory and the CA's, here. For instance, this definition of "Simulationism" is getting closer to the Threefold definition and further from the Big Model definition (which is why I didn't capitalize it above). But let's not let that stop a discussion, shall we?<br/><br/>I <i>am</i> curious about any pitfalls people have experienced with that kind of setup, though. The one I've had to deal with is GM burnout in the "players sim, GM nars" situation, and that can happen pretty fast, although very active players can make up for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145118/#Comment_145118" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T12:06:26+00:00" title="May 20, 2008 12:06PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">--Front-load thematic situation, fit characters, etc, then leave play to be entirely "sim", exploring the consequences<br/>\n--Have one player (the GM) inject Nar/thematic material into play, while the other procedures of play, and the mode of operation of all the other players appears to be strict "sim"</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThis is very curious to me.  The Big Model has a word for this sort of play.  Its called "Narrativism".<br/>\n<br/>\nIts not the model's fault that certain people who self identify as "sim" players under the three-fold continously assume that they therefor must be "sim" players under the Big Model and then try to redefine Big Model Simulation to account for what they do.  These sorts of players are already accounted for in the Big Model.  As Narrativists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above is nothing but bog standard vanilla Nar as has been identified and embraced by the model for years.  Of course you've seen good games come from it, its totally functional play.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat sort of play are you imagining Narrativist play to look like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145145/#Comment_145145" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T13:29:49+00:00" title="May 20, 2008  1:29PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, here's the thing: the questions "is this right" or "is this real" or "what is it like to be an elf" don't, in any way, preclude V-Nar play.
