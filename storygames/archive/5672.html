The game ran smoothly and was full of excitement!  The only questions that really came up where concerning the Harm category.  They seemed like a dump stat, although the players roleplayed them well and included them in the story.  There was some discussion as to how the Harm category could effect the overall game.  Otherwise, there were no problems with the system.  The Chasers advanced often, resulting in two captures and a couple of near misses.  Some APs showed the players never advancing the Chasers, this was not a problem here.  But this was also discussed.  Perhaps some sort of counter or Chance Dice?  Andyways, below is the AP.  Its a long one.  The world did change completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Faustian Transcendence:  When the Chasers Become the Chased<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHades Faustus (Alex):  A pale face beneath matted hair.

As they make their way through the streets of Jersey City, trying to piece together their pasts, they remember key information about the Chasers.  This takes them to New York City, specifically the Metropolitan Library.  Here, a task force from the Red Court attacks them.  After a bloody battle, one of the Runners uses his remote viewing to learn that they need to head to Bayberry Farm, Maine to discover more.  The group decides to assault a training facility.  After a successful attack the go through files and find an electronic map detailing Scarlet Court bases of operation.  This triggers a memory for one of the runners.  He recalls that the clippings he has are actually a code that lead the group to Siberia.  After a disasterous demon attack in Siberia, the group finds the crater base and invades.  It is here the pieces come together.  One of them is Peter Faustus.  All the others are his closest friends.  Peter Faustus presses the button in his head.<br/>\n<br/>\nProgression of Scenes:<br/>\n<br/>\nCrash<br/>\nBarricaded Building<br/>\n\tTop of Building (Leander)<br/>\nSubway Station<br/>\n\tTemporary Scarlet Court Base (Sean, captured)<br/>\n(Seth's) Apartment<br/>\nFire Escape<br/>\n\tInternet Cafe (Sean, escaped)<br/>\n\tRandom Home<br/>\nCar Going Nowhere (Sean found and rejoined)<br/>\n\tTemporary Scarlet Court Base II (Hamish, captured)<br/>\n\tSuburbs (Hamish, escaped)<br/>\nHijacked Ambulance\t(Hamish found and rejoined)<br/>\nHospital<br/>\nBank<br/>\nManhattan Metropolitan Library<br/>\nMaine<br/>\nBayberry Farm Facility<br/>\nSt. Petersburg<br/>\nSiberian Village<br/>\nSiberian Asteroid Crater/Base Camp                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mercutio" title="Mercutio"><img alt="Mercutio" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mercutio">Mercutio</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126943/#Comment_126943" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T14:04:30+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  2:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Act I:  Jersey City and the Scarlet Court<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game opened with players waking up at the site of a crashed black van, burning.  The driver and passenger are unconscious, having been ejected from the vehicle.  The players notice some strange tattoos on the men.  The street is dark, and the only buildings are rectangular brick buildings that all look the same.  The orange neon street lights flicker, stretching the shadows into grotesque figures.  (Sean) is closest to the fire, and his instincts kick in forcing him to try and douse the flames.  He manages to put out the flames; however, the powers flare causing an explosion, which sucks all of the oxygen out of the area.  The flare up destroys the van and the passengers, obliterating the scene and blowing a hole in the wall of one of the buildings, as well as slightly wounding the others.<br/>\nAfter the explosion, four members start asking questions rapidly, while (Alex) sprints to the blown open building and begins to try and blockade himself in with abandoned office furniture.  It is then that the Runners notice the four men coming down the street in their direction.  Three players run after (Alex) with (Sean) taking up position just inside and to the right of the half-baracaded entrance.  (Leander) climbs a ladder to the top of the roof.  He, then, manifests his power, which lets him travel through shadows.  He reappears on a roof three buildings down where he gets a closer look at the men pursuing them.  The tattoos on their arm somehow glow with a darkness, even in the black of night.<br/>\nBack inside the building, (Alex) tries to talk to the voices in his head.  They scream to him about the men and the Scarlet Court.  Freaked out, (Hamish) takes up a computer and begins to try and break down the door.  Meanwhile, the men have caught up now.  (Sean) attacks the first man entering, breaking his neck and stealing his pistol with which he kills two others.  Leander rides the shadows back into the building and incapacitates one of the men.  Unfortunately for (Sean) one of the men manages to knock him out, capturing him.  By this time, (Hamish) has broken down the door through which (Hamish), (Seth), (Alex), and (Leander) escape with their captive.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Here the players split up, as shown above]<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe four men and their captive make a bee-line for the nearest subway.  Inside, the people are not acting normal.  Instead, they walk around as if only shells of themselves.  They do, however, seem determined to avoid the captive man (and Hamish) for that matter.  During an interrogation, (Hamish) approaches the man.  When he gets close, his own tattoos glow a neon-red color that fades slowly.  After a few unanswered questions, the captive man slams his tattooed arms together and disintegrates.  (Seth) uses his remote viewing to locate a safe place, and in doing so remembers the place as his apartment.  The Chasers, though, have caught back up with the group.  They manage to escape capture and catch the train that takes them to (Seth's) apartment.  Unfortunately, (Seth) took a bullet to his knee, resulting in a Permanent Injury.<br/>\n\tMeanwhile, (Sean) awakens in a closet-sized room with a non-descript door, much like a utility closet.  He manifests his powers, hoping to melt the lock, but his power brainstorms.  He burns the entire building, which uses a Starbucks as its front, killing all of the customers and employees inside.  He, nevertheless, escapes into the city.<br/>\n\tBack at the apartment, the group begins regrouping.  (Hamish) volunteers to go to the Pharmacy for bandages and food (Seth has a cabinet full of Vicadin and Malox).  As he begins running, his incredible speed manifests.  Unfortunately it overpowers him.  The result is that he manages to break the sound barrier resulting in the destruction of an intersection and a concussion for himself.  He never manages to make it to Pharmacy, but instead stumbles back to the apartment.  (Alex) and (Leander) agree to take (Seth's) car and get supplies.<br/>\nNow, (Seth) has managed to find an internet cafe where he does some research on the events he has causes around the city.  In doing so, he stumbles upon an interesting bit of news.  An incredible accident at an intersection.  All of the events have been passed off as accidents.  Recognizing the conspiracy and connecting some dots, (Sean) figures that either his original group or someone with answers must be behind the intersection accident.  He, then, decides to first get some new clothes and then track down the new source.  At the intersection, he gets directions for the direction that the man looking a lot like (Hamish) travelled.  When he arrives at the apartment complex, (Sean) recognizes (Ales) and (Leander) and calls out to them.  They direct him to (Seth's) apartment, and (Sean) rendezvous with (Hamish) and (Seth).<br/>\n\tWhen (Sean) knocks on the door, (Seth) attempts to use his remote viewing to see who it was.  The viewing screws up, and instead of showing the door shows the entrance to the building where the Chasers are entering.  (Hamish), paranoid, opens the door and stabs the person behind it, Injuring (Sean).  They pull him inside and try to make a break for it down the fire escape (with Sean and Hamish carrying the broken Seth).  The Chasers catch up and scare Hamish, who accidentally gets too ahead of himself and runs into the overhang cutting off his hear and rendering him unconscious.  (Sean) tosses (Seth) into a garbage can and drops from the fire escape, Injuring his ankle.  Hamish gets captured, but (Sean) and (Seth) escape.  The two head in the direction they think (Alex) and (Leander) traveled.<br/>\n\tMeanwhile, (Alex) decides to ask the spirits in his head for information, while they returning from the drug store.  The power, however, brainstorms and results in the forceful ripping of souls from the bodies of nearby drivers.  A wreck occurs Injuring (Alex's) leg, but not totaling the car.  He received no useful information from the spirits.  They soon there after meet back up with (Sean) and (Seth).<br/>\n\t(Hamish) wakes up suspended in a strange gelatin-like substance.  A dark window shadows the faces of the men watching him.  He develops a plan to escape.  By vibrating the atoms in his body to such a high rate of speed he manages to solid the gel and cause to explode outward, Injuring the men inside and putting a hole in the wall behind him.  He escapes through hole and runs toward the suburbs.<br/>\n\t(Sean), (Alex), (Seth), and (Leander) call an ambulance telling them that the injury is at a location different from where they actually are.  Then they ditch the car and jog to the other location.  (Leander) waits in hiding.  When the ambulance shows up, (Leander) flows through the shadows and grapples one of the responders while (Sean) bullies the other.  (Leander) and (Sean) force the two into the back and have them begin tending to the wounds.  (Leander) destroys the radio and begins to drive away.  (Seth) uses his remote viewing to locate (Hamish), who is running towards the city, halfway through the suburbs now.  Unfortunately, the psychic force knocks (Hamish) to the ground from a super sprint, Injuring him.  The group regroups soon thereafter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mercutio" title="Mercutio"><img alt="Mercutio" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mercutio">Mercutio</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126944/#Comment_126944" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T14:05:20+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  2:05PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Act I Continued:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the wounds have been treated, they tie up the first responders and ditch the ambulance.  They, then, make their way back to the car, having decided to go to New York both to use the library and get the hell out of Jersey City.  Rain, however, starts pouring as they near the bridge, resulting in a severe collision with a semi-truck.  No one in the vehicle is hurt too bad; (Alex) Injures his back.  The whole group, however, is take to a nearby hospital.  While the others are getting treated, (Sean) persuades the nurse that their insurance and id cards where destroyed in the accident, but that she could send the bill to a Mr. Jean Simmons in North Carolina and that all things will be taken care of.  After everyone is released, the group decides to see what was in (Seth's) safety deposit box.  The end result is 2.6 million dollars in poker winnings.  Some of the money is used to buy clothes and new a Cadillac Escalade.  Next on the list is the robbery of a gun shop.  (Leander) uses his shadow movement to infiltrate but loses half of his pinky when he materializes before his hand is completely through the shadows.<br/>\n\tHaving restocked and gained some ammunition, the group feels prepared to try for New York again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAct II:  Bayberry Farm, Maine<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe players roll up to the Metropolitan Library in their new Escalade.  They spend their time researching, but to no avail.  (Alex) tries to get some more information from his spirit friends, but only manages to destroy a couple of books in the library when his power flares wildly.  (Seth), then, once again flares his remote viewing and gets a lock on the facility, located by a town known as Bayberry Farm.  The Chasers, however, have now caught back up with the players at the library.  A battle ensues.  (Sean) rains fiery death upon the Chasers while (Hamish) creates a sort of world wind into which the others shoot bullets at.  The end result is the deaths of thirteen Chasers, no injured or captured Runners.<br/>\n\tAfter the battle, the Runners make haste to Bayberry Farm.  They decide to infiltrate the base.  (Sean) once again rains down fiery death onto the facility guards.  (Leander) runs through the shadows taking down personnel left and right.  The others go through with guns blazing.  <br/>\n\tOnce the facility is clear, (Alex) calls on the spirits of the recently deceased in order to get the password for the main computer.  They type in the password and begin looking at files.  They discover that, at one time, all of them were at this facility, but they retrieve no details beyond that.  They also locate a map presenting the Scarlet Court facilities around the world.  The large dot located in Siberia triggers one of (Leander's) memories regarding the scraps of paper in his jacket.  The magazine clippings conceal a code leading the group to a base in Siberia.  Peter Faustus' home base.<br/>\n\tThus, the group hires a charter plane to Siberia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mercutio" title="Mercutio"><img alt="Mercutio" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mercutio">Mercutio</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126945/#Comment_126945" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T14:05:46+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  2:05PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Act III:  Siberia<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe plane takes them to St. Petersburg, from which they take a train into Siberia followed by a bus to a small Siberian village.  (Hamish) begins trying to hire a guard to lead them to the asteroid crater.  Amazingly, the Scarlet Court has once again caught up with players!  A battle erupts.  (Leander) tries to use his shadow walking, but he brainstorms, resulting in the demon whom he had made a pact with rising from the shadows and destroying the villagers and Scarlet Court and transplanting the whole village to the Siberian Wasteland, but within walking distance of the Asteroid Crater!  Emerging from the bloodbath, shaken and slightly Injured, the group locates a hatch that leads underground.  The group looks to (Seth) for information, so he uses his remote viewing to see into the facility, looking for Peter Faustus; however, he brainstorms!  The result is that he is shown the way to Faustus' office through a montage of exploding heads the sends him into seizures.  He just able to point in the direction while (Hamish) wheels (Seth's) chair in the direction he points.  The rest of the group follows.  The facility is cleared, resulting in a few Minor Injuries.  <br/>\n\tInside the Peter Faustus' office, the group begins looking for information, specifically (Hamish).  (Harmish) suddenly remembers who he is, while looting through the desk.  He is the weapon; he is Peter Faustus.  At that moment, Peter Faustus presses the button inside his head.  Instantly, he atomizes and allows for the ascendance of Transhumans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127030/#Comment_127030" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-16T08:15:01+00:00" title="February 16, 2008  8:15AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was (and am every day) Hamish in this game.<br/><br/>After some early capture rolls, we were really feeling pressured by the chasers, and pushed the scenes along (as can be seen in the scene list).
