I'm glad you enjoyed it.<br><br>It's an interesting discussion. You're right that the game doesn't concentrate on the mechanics of the murder: finding clues, solving the puzzle. I realised, early on in the game, that I could either make the game about relationships or evidence, so I went with the first.<br><br>In that, it resembles P. D. James' books (which I read while growing up). She writes the whole book, then rewrites the last few pages so you can't guess who the murderer is. Thus, there's a sense that solving the murder doesn't quite matter: anyone could have done it.<br><br>You could even say that it's not <i>really</i> a murder mystery game. It's a game about family relationships, squeezed into a murder mystery setting.<br><br>You raised an issue about Side Scenes, which I probably should have explained better in the book. You don't, of course, take someone aside <i>during</i> dinner. Instead, you catch a few words on the stairs, or grab them during cocktails, or as you're going into dinner, or when you break after dinner. You exploit whichever social convention is appropriate: so, to talk to someone after lunch, you suggest a walk in the gardens. To talk to someone after dinner, you ask whether they would like a cigar in the gun room.<br><br>All this becomes easier at breakfast, which isn't a sit-down meal. People arrive gradually, so you can grab a few words as people arrive or when they're the last ones eating.<br><br>The game plays surprsingly well with six or more players. Generally, the Side Scenes become shorter. Rather than five-minute confrontations, they become quick conversations on the stairs. Indeed, whenever the players feel the urge to hurry things along, they generally just do short Side Scenes.<br><br>Incidentally, the Black and White Dice are lifted straight from My Life With Master's Sincerity Die (and other dice) They're a blunt mechanical incentive to do interesting stuff. They also have an interesting status and comic effect.<br/><br/>Thanks again. I really enjoyed the discussion.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
