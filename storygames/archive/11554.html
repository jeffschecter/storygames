Maybe by making some pre-made "agenda-cards", randomly distributed to the players, containing agendas that the puts them against each another (just like Mountain Witch fate cards - "Revenge against other PC character", "Working for the Bad Guys", etc.). I was also thinkin about using that same game's idea of defining clear "Acts" of play - from the Act for presentation of characters, to the Act for fullfilling their agendas. BUT as Ive not played the game yet, I dont how this would turn out. What do you guys think?<br/><br/>THanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257472/#Comment_257472" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T18:02:01+00:00" title="February 21, 2010  6:02PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2010 8:56PM by vini_lessa.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Im not the only to come up with this idea. Nice.<br/><br/>Another tweak I will do when play it, is increasing the importance of Trust points. Maybe doubling its effect (1 pt = 2 dice ).<br/><br/>EDIT: I just realized that doubling Trust effect could unbalance the game ( since 3 is the greater margin of success needed).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257664/#Comment_257664" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T16:24:24+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  4:24PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, another idea for strenghtening the Trust side of Cold City: ignore the Agenda bonus.<br/><br/>This way, Trust would be much more important. <br/><br/>Anyway, thanks guys for the input (the whispered ones, I mean XD ).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Dont know why he didnt showed it off to everybody, but if he dont want to, It would be rude form my part to show it.  <br/><br/>I really wish more people replied to the thread (not whispering I hope <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> ). I feel this game has a lot of potential, but dont know how this turns out in play.<br/><br/>My ideas for tweaking it come from a suspect I have that the Trust aspect of the game may be put aside and forgotten during play, the way it is. I even thought about stiffing the PCs opposition, to force the players to rely more on Trust. But this comes from my experience with Moutain Witch really, dont know how this would translate to Cold City.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257744/#Comment_257744" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T00:33:20+00:00" title="February 23, 2010 12:33AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run Cold City as both a short campaign and as a one-off convention game and in all situations, players milked the Trust; they totally rely on it to get them the outcomes they really want. Every last die counts and players won't hesitate to bring in Trust, one way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I always do when running CC now is to let players get up to the point in character creation just before distributing Trust, then stop and run a very short scene with all the characters. I start it off in media res by banging the table hard and shouting at them "The basement is on fire! The last of the zombies are burning, but one of them stumbles from the flames towards you! (Pointing at random player) What does everybody do?" Give everyone a chance for one or at most two simple actions: answer questions affirmatively to give them further opportunities ("Yes, there is a fre extinguisher here", "Yes, there are confidential files stored here"). After that scene, when all the players have had a chance to see what their comrades do in a crisis, let them distribute their Trust points. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
