I mean, you could theoretically throw it together in a super simple format. But if you want to polish it up so that it's up to the standard of the rest of your game text, that takes time and energy.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm a recent convert to the "give me predeveloped content" camp.

Demo kits are awesome, and I wish more games had them. These days some games don't even include character sheets, why would someone intentionally put up obstacles for people for enjoying their games? Especially in the small scale indie circuit, where the games don't put the food on the table, and all things considered probably cost more than they make. I get 100x the happiness from seeing an AP online than I do from seeing the sales count increase by one on Lulu.<br/><br/>Jeffrey's list is good, but even if you only provide some of the stuff he lists, it will help getting your game into actual play.<br/><br/>The Nordnordost collective has built demo kits for many games (Polaris, Panty Explosion, Love in the Time of Seid and Montsegur 1244 are the ones that come to mind now).  But if the game already has everything prepared, that gives us a lower threshold for offering the game in the Indie Gaming Lounge. We only have four hours to run a game for a group of visitors. And many of our hosts will not know the games they demo by heart, they are greatly helped by the demo kits.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird is a good example of a game that thanks to it's presentation has seen much play. Zombie Cinema is another (except for that horrible black on dark grey rules sheet, but since it's only a single page we'll overlook that), A Taste for Murder doesn't even have character sheets and the necessary game board for free download - but since the rules are very clearly laid out in the order they are needed, the game acts as it's own cheat sheet, and it was our most played game last S\xe4vCon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348645/#Comment_348645" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T01:57:58+00:00" title="November 11, 2011  1:57AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've recently written up a couple of our 20-minute demo games for Ashen Stars and Trail of Cthulhu, and we are now going through the entire line month by month.

But they give you pre-generated characters and setting (basically skipping the first phase/session of standard play), so you can pick one up and go.<br/><br/>I haven't gotten much feedback from them. I know a couple have been played at conventions. They have wildly variable star ratings on RPGnow. That's about all the feedback I've ever gotten on them. I like them, so they continue, but I dunno how useful they are to people.<br/><br/>I used to have a demo kit for carry available, but it was for running 10-15 minute demos (forge booth style), and it got lost in the shuffle at some point. Since the game itself is pretty much pick-up-and-play, I haven't felt the need to generate any additional material for it.<br/><br/>I do tend to try and make examples fairly AP-like, including in- and out-of character conversation and context leading up to the core example, but writing up a full AP for your own game is like making a pumpkin pie from scratch - it's about 90% more work for about 10% more reward over other people's AP.<br/><br/>I dunno, I've come to accept that the first time I play a game it will be halting and weird and curious as we try to figure out how it works and what parts mesh with the people playing and which skills need to be trained. Other people's experiences with the game don't really help me until I've had a chance to try it out first my own way.

I am not a big fan of prewritten adventures, but sometimes you need a more extensive "Example" of how the game is to be played. Also, my self, my wife, and many other friends I know will demo a lot of games, because we like to grow this hobby of ours. But, it is a lot of work to prep for something like a game when you may be running 4-5 different games in single day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348729/#Comment_348729" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T17:18:20+00:00" title="November 11, 2011  5:18PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Because they don't really give a flavour of what the game's like.

And really, there isn't a need for the designers themselves to make the demos. I'd almost rather that product evangelists did. And, it sounds like these kind of resources actually are available for many games, so really all we need is a way to put all the information together so its easy for people looking for the material for games. Perhaps I'll setup a section for this on the wiki.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348741/#Comment_348741" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T21:37:53+00:00" title="November 11, 2011  9:37PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the limitations on the demo thing is that you have to be at a convention or FLGS to reach a handful of people (and the expense that goes with that.)

That being said, it's not eay to remember these mechanics in your head: you need to look them up.  At my last event I tried using a menu of the spont effects your magus could cast, all of them, and the target roll needed.  It was..OK, but not great.<br/><br/>The problem with an Ars demo kit, then, is that it doesn't actually capture the fun of playing Ars.

In fact, I discussed this with Robin and it was one of the criteria in my list of things how to do the demo. However the system is not very complicated so I went for the full monty. And it's quite nice having the other skills there because it encourages people to be creative in using benefits and shows them what kind of coverage of the investigative skills you might expect from one PC. I've run this demo 55 times now and it's been good to me.<br/><br/>With Ashen Stars even though the game is more complex (with tech options and quite a few new skills), benefits are even more important so once again the full sheet was used for the demo.
