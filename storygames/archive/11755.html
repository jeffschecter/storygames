There are so many problems centred around them, and so much work to fix it (of course, sometimes that's part of the challenge and fun in a game, but in the same sense so is working around memorized spells). If ability scores have any sort of influence on the mechanics, and they're randomly rolled, you run into problems. If they have an influence on mechanics and aren't randomly rolled you still run into problems. Problems that somehow are less present without them.<br/><br/>Now I'm sure there are some games which work just fine with them, but they strike me as a rarity. I can think of A Dirty World off hand, and that uses only ability scores, and in a rather different fashion. Pretty much every game from the 80s and 90s uses them, to the point that they're almost as omnipresent in games as dice. Even a lot of newer games have them.<br/><br/>So, why ability scores? Why is that something that's sticking around on RPGs so much?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262492/#Comment_262492" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T09:47:47+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  9:47AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're iconic?

You can learn how to fight with a sword. It's harder to become more intelligent. At least, we like to think certain things are intrinsic and very hard to change.<br/><br/>At a much more meta level, though, I think designers use abilities because they are an abstraction for "things you want to be good at." When you put an 18 into Intelligence and dump your 9 into Strength, you're saying that you want to be good at "smart" things and bad at "strong" things, and you'll probably play a Wizard, right? Abilities also give you fixed categories to organize skills or other traits (e.g., Diplomacy is a Charisma-based skill). All of these things aid niche protection.<br/><br/>Look at how Dogs in the Vineyard uses abilities (called "stats," if I remember right). You have Acuity, Will, Heart, and Body. Different pairs of those are used for the four different kinds of conflicts. Like if you're fighting but not with a gun, you total Body + Will, but as soon as you start shooting, you are using Will + Acuity. Since you never get to add dice for a stat more than once in a conflict, that means escalating from fighting to guns lets you add your Acuity dice, but not if you started the conflict by talking (cuz talking is Acuity + Heart). <br/><br/>My Life with Master has a weird sort of ability score system. You rank your character's Weariness and Self-Loathing, and these influence (up and down, according to clever little formulas) how well you can do terrible things to people, but succeeding and failing at those terrible things makes your Weariness and Self-Loathing go up. <br/><br/>My problems with ability scores in AD&amp;D are:<br/>* the funky way they handled Exceptional Strength (e.g., 18/00)<br/>* the derivative effects of each ability score (e.g., Dex 14 could mean a -2 to AC)<br/>* the individual scales of such effects and how they differ between abilities (a 14 Dex might be better than a 14 Int).<br/><br/>These are problems they solved in 3E and 4E.<br/><br/>There are plenty of games that have no abilities (just skills, or not even skills). FATE-based games, for example. Or carry, a game about war, which has no traits at all. Shock: has some numeric traits, but I hesitate to call them ability scores in the sense used here. <br/><br/>What do you believe are the problems with ability scores? How do you even /define/ "ability score," to make sure we're talking about the same thing? At the highest level of design, if you want dice, you'll need a way to determine what dice to roll (or how to interpret them) and if you want it to be tied to the character somehow, you need some kind of number associated with the character. Ability scores are just one kind of number.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262499/#Comment_262499" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T10:08:56+00:00" title="March 17, 2010 10:08AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite><br/>A reverse question: What do we gain by throwing out ability scores?

Given that you could take out ability scores, and not much would change except for some better balance, I'm surprised that didn't happen along with the magic system changing in every derivative system. You already have race and class (or background and profession, however you want to classify it), which gives you some customisation options. <br/><br/>It's not just AD&amp;D though. GURPS would benefit from throwing them out, as they're a major cause of the system breaking, admitted to in 4e having DX and IQ cost twice as much as ST and HT. <br/><br/>Off topic: How do I multiquote?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262501/#Comment_262501" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T10:12:51+00:00" title="March 17, 2010 10:12AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>Off topic: How do I multiquote?</blockquote>\nHighlight the bit you want to quote.

A 9 strength fighter is weaker than an 18 strength fighter, but the 9 Strength fighter could be stronger than the 15 Strength mage. It's a little bit counter intuitive, but if the effects of the ability scores aren't fixed it doesn't matter a great deal. You could do a similar thing by just ranking them from 1-6. So Strength 1 and Dexterity 2 would suggest you're less agile than you are strong, but not say a great deal about how that relates to someone else.<br/><br/>The other solution is a life path.

I can think of may great examples of wizards that aren't smart (Rincewind of the Discworld series), or priests that aren't particularly wise (popularized versions of Friar Tuck of Robin Hood mythology). That's why having thematic abilities might work better than just assuming things based on traditional concepts.<br/><br/>I must admit I prefer games that are a bit more open in what and how you do things, as opposed to being limited by what the scores of a few abilities say. We know that people are diverse and capable of many varied things in real life, so why can't our characters be so as well? But it really is hard to get that sweet spot in game mechanics, where you can have things that are simple yet complex, accomodating and yet preventing the inevitable Munchkin from trying to break the system.<br/><br/>Probably the best way of doing things without static abilities and bonuses would be to use systems that are inherently more descriptive and rooting the characters in the fiction, such as PDQ, TSOY, Lady Blackbird, Fudge, and Fate. Fudge and Fate would actually work quite well building upon the basic iconic assumptions that a "fighter is strong," a "thief is tricky," etc., and then expanding upon those with further abilities and definitions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262569/#Comment_262569" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T14:32:24+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  2:32PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the game I'm working on, your ability scores cover  basic adventuring tasks like Fighting or Exploring.

Just mark "Strength +2" for the character instead.<br/><br/>But that was actually less fun than having the scores themselves, so I put them back in.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure why, but I think it heps define your character for you a little more, which is important.</blockquote>\nBrian: I just wanted to tell you that I feel your pain. My solution in this has been something rather clever: I just use the entire score as the ability modifier in checks, actively refusing the layer of complexity added by a separate modifier. This might seem to give you too much variance (after all, characters could have even 15 points of difference in their abilities!), but it actually so happens that if you drop out the degenerate ability score matrices from later editions of D&amp;D and use only 3d6, there is no problem: the great majority of characters will have abilities in the 6-15 range, which corresponds rather nicely with the -5 to +5 range of modifiers from 3rd edition D&amp;D. It's still a bit more than the -3 to +3 in basic D&amp;D, but for my purposes it's quite nice; abilities have an impact on how characters approach things, just as they should, but most characters will only have one exceptional (over 13 or under 8, say) ability, at least to begin with. This also means that when you have a ridiculous strength score like 18 (representing what, top 3% of humanity?), it also matters hugely in terms of what the character can expect to accomplish with the ability. Cinematic and tidy, nowadays I couldn't imagine going back to a separate ability modifier.<br/><br/>As for the more general topic, isn't this just the same as asking whether characters should be differentiated from each other based on their capabilities? The answer is obviously going to hang on what the game is trying to accomplish. Many games go for D&amp;D-like team adventure, in which character differentiation is nice because it makes different characters do different things. This could be achieved without numerical abilities, but those have tradition and utility on their side, so alternative solutions are not that common.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262575/#Comment_262575" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T14:46:18+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  2:46PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way ability scores help is that they are a descriptor that every character has. Now granted, we could use different descriptors (such as a common skill list). I also find it useful to have broad spectrum descriptors.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>It seems that ability scores - whether as presented in D&amp;D (whatever editions they may be), or as roll modifiers only (True 20), or as a base for rolling (GURPS, Warhammer Fantasy RPG), or dice (Dungeon Squad)</blockquote>\nSome other ways I have used ability scores:<br/><br/>In one game I was designing, instead of the ability score directly affecting success, ability scores just affected the point cost of skills. This a high dexterity character would probably be better at dexterity type skills, but it wasn't a given. They might just have broader skill.<br/><br/>Another way is that ability scores are primarily used for things other than success rolls. The way I have started to run RuneQuest, the ability scores don't contribute to skill bonuses. Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Size all affect combat by allowing use of certain weapons, allowing higher action speed, and granting higher hit points. Intelligence limits how many spells can be memorized. Power is spell points and spirit combat hit points. Now ability score rolls can still be made (and this is the primary effect of Charisma). When building a character, you get so many points to use on ability scores. And then you assign an array of percentage bonuses to the skill modifiers. The one thing is that I asked players to consider their ability scores in applying modifiers, but about the only placements I would ever veto would be a low dex, large PC putting +25% into their dodge, or a low intelligence PC having a high knowledge skills modifier. But even then, a player could probably talk me into a justification.<br/><br/>I'm trying to think if I've ever played an RPG without ability scores. I really can't think of one. I do see the problems that ability scores present. In fact, RuneQuest really shows this. Intelligence is so important that I couldn't figure out a way to do point buy and steer players away from always maximizing intelligence. Yet, when I considered just removing ability scores entirely, it just didn't work for me. Pure strength is useful to know, but doesn't seem like a skill, although it is trainable (and RuneQuest provides rules that do allow strength training).<br/><br/>I've also seen problems with casting everything as a skill. Invariably something gets left out and something that should have been part of the character concept isn't, either because the player didn't understand the skill list, or got lost in a huge skill list, or because there aren't enough points to buy a decent set of "everyman" skills and purchase some specialties also. This issue can be alleviated by having a good system of defaults, though often such systems are based on ability scores.<br/><br/>In the end, I keep coming back to ability scores being useful, at least for the types of games I tend to play.<br/><br/>Now Dogs in the Vineyard is interesting, because the stats aren't used quite the same way as other games use ability scores, however, they are a good example of how useful it is to have some common ground. If you just had traits in DitV, how would you handle escalation? How would you know which trait to roll to start a conflict (sure, the initiator can probably pick a trait, but how about the other guy?). So even a system that is very different from D&amp;D, RuneQuest, and GURPS still depends on ability scores.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262583/#Comment_262583" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T15:18:32+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  3:18PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>I can think of may great examples of wizards that aren't smart (Rincewind of the Discworld series), or priests that aren't particularly wise (popularized versions of Friar Tuck of Robin Hood mythology).</blockquote>\nThey have a fair amount of author fiat carrying them along though. I suppose that could be solved by having a separate luck score. Have a default that everyone is supposed to hit, if you're over that you have a negative luck score, and if you're under you have a positive score. And then work that in somehow depending on the mechanics. Without that, while something might be a fine concept in a story, I don't think it works at all in the type of game that uses ability scores. If you've got an ability score you're rolling against it. On the other hand, say with HeroQuest, you might have "bumbling wizard" as part of your description, give it a high score and somehow use it to succeed at tasks by luck. You're still effective, but how you go about success is different. I figure to use something like GURPS or D&amp;D for a dense wizard would be unsatisfying, as the results wouldn't match the stories. (NB: I haven't read Discworld, so I'm guessing here).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>But it really is hard to get that sweet spot in game mechanics, where you can have things that are simple yet complex, accomodating and yet preventing the inevitable Munchkin from trying to break the system.</blockquote>\nThe thing I've felt here is that usually it's the ability scores that facilitate munchkinism, so much in fact that randomly rolling a good score in D&amp;D will get you accused of being a munchkin.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>Probably the best way of doing things without static abilities and bonuses would be to use systems that are inherently more descriptive and rooting the characters in the fiction, such as PDQ, TSOY, Lady Blackbird, Fudge, and Fate.

I also like the more creative ability score interpretations, like Monsters &amp; Other Childish Things, with "hands", "feet", "guts" etc. There's a lot of flexibility in how you use them compared to Strength and Intelligence. The descriptive systems like PDQ also let you highlight what you think of with your character. If your character concept doesn't centre around being particularly unusual, you'll have a bunch of scores in the average range, but at the same time they tempt you to do something a bit different (perhaps this is a good thing too?).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite>In one game I was designing, instead of the ability score directly affecting success, ability scores just affected the point cost of skills.

Intelligence is so important that I couldn't figure out a way to do point buy and steer players away from always maximizing intelligence.</blockquote>\nI see this with D&amp;D too, and GURPS for that matter. In D&amp;D each class has certain abilities that really need to be high to take advantage of them, and they have a rather cumulative effect. Strength is a big one here - to be a good fighter and take advantage of being able to use any weapon and any armour, you need a fair amount of strength to just be able to carry it without encumbrance. Low strength and you have a marginal advantage over a rogue, since you're wearing light armour anyway. I suppose that serves to add some more diversity to the classes, but it takes balance out quite a bit, and each successive version of D&amp;D has tried to be somewhat more balanced than the previous one, to the point that it seems to be more important than some of the benefits of ability scores that have been brought up.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite>I've also seen problems with casting everything as a skill.

I'm not hugely fond of skill lists either, and I am in favour of ditching NWPs in 2e in favour of just leaving it to ability scores. GURPS, Wild Talents, and a number of other point buy games also lend themselves to optimising in a way that has you pretty much just with the ability score and then a small modifier for a specialty (which makes me like the systems that just let you buy a couple specialties and wrap everything else into scores). I guess that gives an answer, in that in some ways they're preferable to skills.<br/><br/>Incidentally I've found a few systems that were really interesting with their use of ability scores. Dragonlance 5th Age (which I just got my hands on for $5, yay!) uses scores and codes in place of classes, which is a nice handling. imPresa uses a dice pool system where ability score is the number of dice you're rolling while skill is the number you have to beat for success. It's quite intuitive.<br/><br/>I guess I can narrow what I was thinking initially down a bit more after reading this discussion. I wonder why ability scores when you've got something else? Sometimes it goes the other way - why skills when you can use ability scores? In the example of a system where the score determines how much a skill costs, I could see it serving a function similar to class, and there would be useful, but might be redundant if there also is class. <br/><br/>This redundancy really does show up in D&amp;D - if you roll in order, the results determine which class you pick, so if you pick the class first and then arrange your scores you have to do it roughly in a fashion that would reverse engineer that process. You likely wouldn't play a priest in 2e with a Wisdom less than 13 (making the Druid's 12 requirement rather unimportant), if you're rolling in order, so your score is going to be 13+ when you choose priest first. <br/><br/>Rather than redundancy, it shows up in GURPS with game balance issues, where if you don't pump DX or IQ, you're less competent than someone who does. I assume RuneQuest hits the same point with Intelligence. If you're going to have that point, why bother with them at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262625/#Comment_262625" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T20:50:31+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  8:50PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As to having both ability scores and skills, I like having ability scores to cover those broad strokes, and things that don't do necessarily well as skills.Taking RuneQuest for an example: How much you can lift, how fast you are in combat, hit points, how many spells you can memorize, how many spell points you have. The skill bonuses (which actually are ability scores in a way) are nice because they give a broad generalization of ability, and the way I use them with the experience system means that someone who is good at "attack" will always have an experience advantage over someone not as good in "attack". One thing keeps all "fighters" from having the same skill abilities. You have to distribute one +5, two +10, two +15, two +20, and one +25 amongst a bunch of abilities, several of which are relevant to combat. So one guy might be +25 attack while another is +25 parry. If one wants to be good outside combat, then the variation comes in even more. One guy might be +25 knowledge, +20 parry, +20 manipulation, +15 attack, +15 dodge, etc. While another guy might put all his high scores into non-combat areas. There was always some variation on the more normal ability scores, depending on how much the player wanted to concentrate on magic use, though I accidentally gave a bit too large a point pool, so players didn't have to sacrifice too much. If I start up again, I will reduce the point pool (the point pool actually originated from reverse engineering a couple players totally arbitrary attribute picks when I decided to jump start the game without coming up with a point system - that was what also led to the very simple system for picking skill abilities).<br/><br/>Perhaps some of the advantage of having both skills and abilities comes from having a crunchy system. OD&amp;D works quite nice with a simpler system, though it still does have abilities and skills, it's just that it's skill list is in very broad strokes - the character classes). Tunnels &amp; Trolls provides an example more heavily weighted to just abilities, though it still has character classes.<br/><br/>I really can't imagine a system with only abilities being any more palatable than a system with only skills or traits. I guess part of the appeal for me comes from a set of abilities that usually are not as easy to change as skills/traits, or at least are changed differently (and perhaps this is part of where GURPS and Hero actually fail for me, abilities are just as or more easily changed that skills). Somehow having the two different types of ratings adds some depth to the system.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
