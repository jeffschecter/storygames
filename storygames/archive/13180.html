Example: the extent of the "I win this conflict" power in 3:16. Fighting bugs on a planet, works great! Fighting with another character...dunno! The game builds and builds toward intercharacter conflict and then the floor drops out from under you. (Just one example pulled out of my head at the moment; I'm not bagging on 3:16. But after lots of SG threads featuring unspecific allegations and vague references, I feel like I'm better off backing up stuff I say with specific examples.)<br/><br/>As a player, hm. I feel uncertain when it's not clear to me what my risk/reward is for doing something mechanical. Or when I'm playing with a new (to me) GM, and I'm not sure where our creative instincts intersect. Example: I'm all about high-stakes situation changes but you're all about no-win moral choices, so when you make me choose which of two things I'm going to lose at and I don't perceive any real situational change on the thing I'm going to keep, that bums me out. Makes me feel like I'm being tested for the "right" answer rather than being open to whatever answer I give.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maciej%20Sabat" title="Maciej Sabat"><img alt="Maciej Sabat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/754/nT5L0047RIGJY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maciej%20Sabat">Maciej Sabat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296891/#Comment_296891" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T11:21:29+00:00" title="October 14, 2010 11:21AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel akward when not catching the references.

It's bearable when being a player, but way more difficult for a GM. Of course - the best option is to ask for explanation, but sometimes the 'flow' of the game suffers.

especially in sessions with a lot of dialog and not as much contact with the mechanics. It's hard for me to figure out if the players are actually digging on all the talking, or if they'd rather be doing something else.</blockquote>\nThis would be my main concern, specially with a new group.<br/><br/>The rest of the time, when I start feeling uncertain, lost or insecure, I stop doing that and start being awesome instead. Dunno, maybe it is because I'm a really open and talkative guy, buy I never feel insecure for long, as I always ask and tell about it, so we always are in the same page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296960/#Comment_296960" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-15T01:35:11+00:00" title="October 15, 2010  1:35AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be worred if there wasn't uncertainty.

If I jump in here we'll be at this all day. <br/><br/>But that one, up above, about losing control of my character? Yeah, that one. I don't have that problem as a GM, but as a player, I hate it when my character appears inept, foolish, or moronic without my consent. We can blame the dice, but really it's a GM thing. A missed roll shouldn't make my character into an idiot.<br/><br/>I seldom feel more certain, at home, or confident, though, as I do when running an RPG. All defeats are temporary, then, and all victories are shared with the whole table.

One CG guy wants to string them up as a warning to other bandits, the LG paladin wants to obey the charter and execute them painlessly, I (NG) agree we should execute them as per our charter but have no problems lying to them and intimidating them to try to get information out of them - and one player seems to get really OOC upset "This campaign is *dark*" she says, and doesn't contribute much to the rest of the session which left me wondering both A) am I really in-character?  Would a neutral good character execute bandits of unknown alignment [we didn't bother to check, assuming they were evil]?  and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> do we need to have some kind of metagame conversation about what lines we shouldn't cross that I'm too much of a wimp to bring up?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
