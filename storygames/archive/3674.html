For every bead you move from Self to Mind Zero, you roll a die after the mission, and on a roll of 1 you lose 1 point of Self. This seems a little steep to me and would turn the game into something more fatalistic than grim.<br/>Possibly solution, lose 1 Self for every two dice which end up with 1, but then moving 1 dice is absolutely risk free.<br/>2. For every bead you move, you roll a die after the mission, If you rolled one 1, switch a memory with the memory pool, if you rolled two 1's, delete a Morality trait and write a new one. If you rolled 3 1s or above, do both and lose 1 Self.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82469/#Comment_82469" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-20T08:59:26+00:00" title="July 20, 2007  8:59AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, maybe take the second but alter it, no dice rolling. You know what you're going to risk, what you're going to give up in order to be in the mission, and afterwards you pay the price, not the risk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
