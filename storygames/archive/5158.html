Do you mean, "A specific session of gameplay," or "Published rules text"?<br/><br/>I mean, it sort of looks to me you're talking about some system for rating game books. But adjectival categories are things I'm only comfortable using to describe gameplay experiences; the words are just too subjective for anything purporting to be a fair "review."<br/><br/>How's this actually any different than assigning a rating based on stars or a 10-point scale? It sounds to me what you're asking for is something like the FACERIP (Marvel Superheros RPG) categories, but for book reviews.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116464/#Comment_116464" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T07:50:38+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  7:50AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I don't really understand why you feel the need to attach a standardised rating scale to an overwhelmingly subjective experience.

That will only lead to popularity contests, obviously.</blockquote>\nI feel the same, but in a different way:<br/><br/>There was really no way that I was going to play Shadowrun again.  Then Eric Provost stepped up with a set of house-rules and a setting mod. We're still FUNDAMENTALLY playing Shadowrun, and it's a fucking blast (definitely 80% or higher).  If I was playing Shadowrun at a convention or other "use the rules as is, the play style as-is, and the default setting", I would be clawing my eyes out.<br/><br/>When Mark Causey runs The Shadow Of Yesterday, I. Fucking. Play. He throws down hardcore, and in a really fun way. Another GM, another setting, I might not be quite as motivated.<br/><br/>Rifts? Fuck that noise. And yet, I'm planning on running a Rifts Africa game, with most of the original rules, this year: turning down the rules, turning up the setting, and using a bunch of "story games tricks" to make it bearable and fun. <br/><br/>A lot of the game experience comes down to:<br/>The GM (in games with a GM)<br/>The Players<br/>The setting<br/>The rules/rules mods<br/>The level of creativity<br/>The level of enthusiasm<br/><br/>To look at games themselves through this lens, without any of the game experience stuff above, well I don't mean to be harsh, but it's a lot like the old Ghostbuster RPG description of "Cold Science". As if the game experience is wholly the book it comes from.<br/><br/>I mean, the idea of starting up a series of RPG reviews in the classic "game book review" sense, and keep it on a "No, a rating of 50% <b>IS AVERAGE</b>, not 'crap' " scale would perhaps be worthwhile. We don't have as much creep in RPG reviews as there are with console game reviews (where "average" is 80%). However, unlike console reviews there's a ton of subjective stuff going on.  I was completely unsold on Unhallowed Metropolis because of a boring-ass con experience (which yet showed off the completeness, and unfortunate mediocrity, of the system. The rest sucked, though: My buddy Travis *fucked the game to life* so that we wouldn't waste any time). And yet, I do not deny that for others they have the game in their top 10 percentile because of the exciting setting and the creativity and character-play of the people at the table.<br/><br/>With console games, the GM, players, rules, creativity, all that is not applicable, so the range you're left with is still subjective, but far more narrow. I can say "Clive Barker's Jericho was very pretty, and yet it sucked", and will find my opinion reflected by a majority of gamers. Try that with GURPS, or Best Friends.<br/><br/>In the end, looking at your scale, if I tried to contribute, I can honestly not think of a game other than Space Master that I would put below Fair, and I can not think of a single game that I would classify as "Superb".  But maybe I'm just being deceived by your rating ranks, which themselves again seem to heap on a big spoonful of subjectivity.  I could rather see a game divided up into 14 categories, where each category gets a subjective rating ("Ready to play with minimal bookkeeping"; "The game setting makes the reader excited to play"; "the rules are creative and thought was given to the style of play they were built for"; "Playing a Role is the most important aspect of this game"; "Swing Vote", etc). Even the choosing of those categories will be somewhat subjective. But it's a lot easier to stomach rating a game like GURPS (which again for me is "won't fucking touch it as-is, unless someone runs it for me with a creative setting, rules mods, and some enthusiasm; then I will totally happily play it, and LOVE the experience! Which these days, happens A Lot") Superb in some categories, Fair in others, Good in many, and Terrible in a few, than to just give it a blanket "Mediocre" or something.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? Not to harsh the buzz, I actually want to keep a dialog going about this issue. Maybe we'll all learn something.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116483/#Comment_116483" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T08:43:35+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  8:43AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always found reviews more useful when they tell me details about what worked for the reviewer and what didn't and why.

Any attempt to rate a book as a game is going to fail, because the game experience is highly subjective and powerfully influenced by a number of non-book factors.  I think if we try to rate a book <em>as a book</em>, then we'll have a lot more success.  The categories for rating a book as a book are more like: clarity, ease of navigation, evocative art, and so on.  You <em>might</em> be able to squeeze in innovation and originality, but that's hedging out onto subjective (and very very comparative, instead of standards-based) ground.  I'm not sure, however, if that kind of scale would be anything you'd be interested in, because it wouldn't describe the game experience, which is what I suspect you want information on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116497/#Comment_116497" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T09:19:14+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  9:19AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of a standardized rating system, though the efficacy of words versus "X out of Y stars" is questionable, if only because one must know or look up the relative quality of each word.<br/><br/>I also agree with Andy that it should be broken into a few key categories, and then a (weighted?) average taken for a final measure of quality.

I only read a couple of reviewers because I've found them thorough and consistent in their rating criteria across multiple games.

What I was going to say was. . . most of what people want to measure here can't be measured objectively, because stuff like "Fun" (or even "readability") is wholly dependent upon the individual doing the playing or reading. <br/><br/>What this will result in is a nice, codified, list of stuff that the participating parties think is "fun" (or readable, intuitive, clever, etc). Or, more preceiselty, a codified list of prescriptive personal preference. And, frankly, I couldn't care less about what other people think I should like. What I like is determined by one person. Me.<br/><br/>Now, that said I <i>did</i> read what you wrote. What <i>you</i> don't seem to get is that codifying personal preferences does not make such preferences any more objective. I do see some benefit in saying "This is what X group of people likes" so, for instance, if you know that you share similar tastes with said group of people, you know that you might like the same thing. <br/><br/>What I don't see a benefit in is saying "This is how it is!" and that seems to be more of what you're aiming for. A kind of prescriptive barometer (sp?) for what constitutes fun, or quality, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116571/#Comment_116571" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T12:35:51+00:00" title="December 27, 2007 12:35PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Mattijs,</p>\n<p>Well, pushing "book review" culture seems like a step backward from pushing "actual play" culture, so it's not really suprising the subject has provoked some knee-jerk hostility. Brand Robins had started writing some stuff about the validity of game reviews, which I was interested to hear about. (I'm sure he'll publish that <em>DitV</em> review any day now.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, to get back to what you actually wanted to talk about...</p>\n<p>I think some categories that you could rate on might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presentation: How attractive/professional the book appears, including artwork and layout. Does it draw a person into the text or does it turn one off? If somebody glances through this briefly, will they get a good idea what this game might be about and be able to decide if they want to play?</li>\n<li>Construction: The physical quality of the book itself. Not so much eye-catching bells-and-whistles (that's Presentation) as just being quality materials and assembly. Does the binding fall apart after a couple uses, or can it take a realistic amount of wear-and-tear due to handling? Does the non value-added price of the product seem to correspond to the object you get?</li>\n<li>Intelligibility: Does the text concisely and opaquely present the game the author is trying to describe, or is it poorly-organized or does it make unreasonable assumptions about the reader's <em>a priori</em> knowledge? Does this stuff make sense to anybody except the author and the people he plays this game with?</li>\n<li>Digestablilty: Is the stuff which potential players are required to understand small enough that they can reasonably be expected to <i>learn the rules</i>, or will one person end up "carrying" the rules and end up as the "rules lawyer" for everyone else?</li>\n<li>Completeness: Does the text actually present everything you need to know to run the game, or will someone end up putting a lot of work into the game before they can actually play it? Not so much "GM-prep," as the practical matter of filling in significant swaths of system that are not clearly or workably addressed by the text.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are areas I think you can find wide agreement on standards for good or bad, and not as mere personal tastes. I mean, nobody's really going to argue that they <em>like</em> books that fall apart, right?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116656/#Comment_116656" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T16:21:55+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  4:21PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2007 4:22PM by shreyas.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Sometimes assumptions are hard to make because they are <em>completely implausible.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
