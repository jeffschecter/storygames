If the task is climbing a wall, the GM could say the OB is 4 but manufacture a fictional reason for a disadvantage on the spot (the wind kicks up for example) -- and with the Disadvantage, it raises it to Ob 5, or the GM could just say the climb is Ob 5 with no express fictional Disadvantage and leave it at that. (The mechanical distinction, as I understand it, is that a player with no specific skill available would prefer that the Ob be a result of Disadvantages and not a result of the base Ob because the base Ob is doubled on a Beginner's Luck roll). <br/><br/>How do you draw the Ob line and why?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412122/#Comment_412122" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-17T09:02:00+00:00" title="April 17, 2013  9:02AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obstacle is described by the skill factors (and to an extent by the table that describes difficulites early on).

Seems like a pretty arbitrary decision. Maybe that's just the way it is. The only result of this rule that I see is that in addition to the normal Ob setting, the GM has a super nuanced way to adjust the probability of success for beginners.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412126/#Comment_412126" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-17T09:53:42+00:00" title="April 17, 2013  9:53AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The basic obstacles table on page, like, 15 I think, is really really helpful.

I mean, I don't think I'd have any trouble assigning the Ob or the Disadvantages. I'd just do it; I'd be consistent and reasonable; and, the game would proceed. I just wonder if there is a logic to the rule that I'm missing. <br/><br/>Assume that a PC is running from some wolves through a forest. The PC encounters an old shed with a rusty lock on the door. The PC states his intent, "hide from the wolves," and his task "pick the lock and enter the shed." The PC doesn't actually know how to pick locks. This is an odd time to try to learn, but whatever, that's his plan.  <br/><br/>The GM states, "okay that's a lock pick test (I ASSUME there is some kind of lock picking skill in the book, but if there isn't, substitute whatever skill is appropriate for this example to work. The particular skill is not the issue)." The GM states that if the PC fails, he will be surrounded by the slavering wolves with no clear escape.  <br/><br/>The GM now determines the Ob and Disadvantages (if any) of this task. The GM, of course, also determines the fiction that supports the Ob. <br/><br/>Case 1: The GM could decide that the rust is merely cosmetic and doesn't affect the lock, but the lock still hard to crack Ob 5. The Beginner's luck attempt means that the Ob is doubled -- Ob 10. <br/><br/>Case 2: The GM could decide that the lock is Ob 4, but it's hard to make the tumblers move because of the rust so the Ob is increased by a penalty of 1 (for the purpose of this example, the particular rationale for the disadvantage isn't important either. If you don't like the rust disadvantage, maybe it starts raining and that's the disadvantage -- that's not important). In this case, the base Ob is doubled to 8 but the disadvantageous rust is not doubled -- we get Ob 9. <br/><br/>Both GM decisions seem reasonable -- but, what's the point? Is the only reason for the nuanced "disadvantages do not double" rule so that the GM can make fine adjustments with the fiction in order to hit a pin point Ob for Beginner's luck rolls? Is it all about odd Ob numbers? Does this rule do anything else that I'm missing? As a practical matter, why is it ever worthwhile to distinguish between the base Ob and the disadvantages? Why not just always incorporate the totality of the circumstances into the base Ob and call it good?                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412144/#Comment_412144" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-17T17:24:18+00:00" title="April 17, 2013  5:24PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a tool for the GM to say "this is important to the task; this is just incidental".

I understand that you are providing an arbitary example in order to discuss Obs and Disadvantage, but still...<br/><br/>Was the Old shed with the rusty lock prior established either through play or prep? It seems rather specific for BW, more than likely the example reflects what you might have thrown the player's way as an obstable / antagonism to their implied <b><i>intent</i></b> of escaping the wolves. But why?<br/><br/>Are their beliefs involved? Does the scene highlight a trait or instinct? Did the player flag the need for developing their burgeoning lockpick skill? If so, then great! The above advice is sound. However, if it was simply an 'off the cuff' means to increase tension during the chase scene, It seems to me better to simply say Yes, or scan their BITs before framing the obstacle.

I agree with Vanguard. My inclination is that you can't fiction your way out of a disadvantage -- you have to lobby for advantage dice if you want an edge. If you're up against a test (picking a lock) and there is a disadvantage (rusty), you can't pause the test, scrub it with CLR, and then resume the test with no disadvantage. Putting CLR on the lock is <b>part</b> of your character's task to achieve his intent -- if you have some CLR on you, you'd just get a +1D advantage. <br/><br/>If you could simply narrate clever solutions to disadvantages and negate them, it would swallow the advantage/disadvantage rules. If you could negate disadvantages by having a smart answer for everything the GM says, then the game would be about out-witting the GM. But, it's not about that.The testing is all an abstraction -- it's not literal.  The rules are there so that the GM doesn't have to be a lock expert who knows exactly how rust would affect a lock. "The lock is rusty" doesn't literally mean that the lock is rusty with all that entails -- it's just code for "this lock is difficult to open -- in part because of inherent qualities of the lock, and in part because of unusual circumstances." The player can then say something like, "I put oil on it" to represent that the character has access to something that will make the lock less difficult. If it was REAL LIFE, would "putting oil" on a rusty lock REALLY make it easier to pick? I don't know. Maybe. I'm not a cat burglar from the 13th century. But, off the top of my head, oil might make it way harder -- all that greasy oil messing up the sound and feel of the tumblers -- but, whatever, it's fine -- "I put oil on it" is good enough because it's code for "my character knows what he's doing and has something up his sleeve to cope with unusual lock circumstances." So, he gets +1D.                            </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
