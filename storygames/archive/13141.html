"Role-play" in this case is a wide term: It means tabletop, larp, jeepform, freeform - all these things that we do. Articles will be written in an accessible, journalistic style. There will be a strong visual focus, with pictorials in each issue. <br/><br/>We want you to write for us. We want you to show us what's cool, that the world doesn't know about. We are curious, and expect you to be. We don't know everything going on in Spain, or the Czech Republic, or Hungary, or even Ireland. We want to know, and our readers want to know - and see pictures.<br/><br/>The editors for the first issue are located in Norway, Denmark and Finland, and include former chief editors of Rollespilleren, Roolipelaaja and Imagonem. For later issues, we will expand to other countries. (If you are interested in editing later issues, or know someone who is, let us know!)<br/><br/>You can contact us at: contact (at) playgroundmagazine (dot) net. You can also read our vision document pdf <a href="http://playgroundroleplayingmagazine.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/vision01.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. And, of course, you can post questions in this thread!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
