Anyone know the full scoop?</blockquote>\nThe rankings are based off of the user ratings. (Here's a <a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/wiki/page/User_Guide#toc7" rel="nofollow">link</a> to the explanation). Once a game has at least 5 ratings it gets ranked. They apply a secret "shill-buster algorithm" to weed out suspicious rating patterns (e.g. people who just rate a single game 1 or 10) and then they use a Bayesian averaging algorithm on the individual user ratings to determine the "geek rating" and place it in the overall rank. This means that a game's popularity has some impact on the rank, but it also makes the rankings less swingy because cult favorites (e.g. a game rated 10 by only a handful of people) can't dominate the charts. In theory, the quality of the rankings improves when more people rate their games, so people should go do it, especially if they have experience with a lot of games. (Also, for anyone unfamiliar with the site, it tracks both "RPGs" and "RPG Items". RPGs are the game you play, RPG Items are the individual products like rule books. This is to account for the D&amp;D style model where you might need multiple products like a Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual to play the game. Since most of the games that are popular in this community have a single book per game it might seem a little odd to treat them independently.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311593/#Comment_311593" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T00:12:43+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 12:12AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, they do pretty well on RPGG.

Those aren't independent factors, but they're not always identical either.

I don't think a rating for every risk branded game would be helpful, but then each risk game stands on it's own as a product. even board game expansions have a very clear role to judged on and can be rated based on how they changed their base game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Sometimes poorly. And sometimes they have pretty pictures. And sometimes they come in form factors that don't fit on your game shelf. And sometimes they have page after page of poorly written fiction that have no impact on the game. There are all sorts of judging factors you can apply to a game product that have little to do with how the game plays. The RPG rating is for the game. The RPG Item rating is for the book / box set / whatever. They're not independent, but they're not the same thing either.<br/><br/>And I agree that it's unintuitive, which is why I pointed it out in my first post in the thread -- people rating games they've played should focus on rating the RPG not the RPG Items.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312057/#Comment_312057" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T10:21:35+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 10:21AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2011 10:22AM by Tim C Koppang.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>And I agree that it's unintuitive, which is why I pointed it out in my first post in the thread -- people rating games they've played should focus on rating the RPG not the RPG Items.</blockquote>\nThe problem is search.  You plug a game title in the search bar and two things pop up: the "system" entry and the "item" entry.  Which one are you going to click on?  It's very confusing.  And it not only splits the ratings, but also forum entries, files, etc.  By splitting games like they do, the RPG Geek people are providing an incomplete picture that is only amplified for small-press and one-off releases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brenton" title="Brenton"><img alt="Brenton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brenton">Brenton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312062/#Comment_312062" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T10:55:20+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 10:55AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea is sound, I think, but really only works for big press models, like D&amp;D and White Wolf.<br/><br/>With large, multi-product games, like D&amp;D, it makes sense to me that I can rate the entire game as, say, 7/10.  However, I might find that "1000 Magical Knick Knacks" is excellent, a 10/10 product and expansion for the game, but that the adventure "Whereabouts is the Great Wizard Waldon" is awful, a 2/10 waste of money.  This kind of thing is useful for me as a consumer because I can see both (1) what games are good, and (2) what particular products of those games are worth getting. An aggregate system wouldn't really work, in my opinion, because, at least for these types of games, the game is not the sum of its products.  For example, 3rd edition D&amp;D is a fun game and deserves a high rating, but most of the supplements that were released for it were crap.  Most of the products should get low ratings, but there is no reason that these should pull down the overall game rating.<br/><br/>I get what Jared is saying, though.  He refers to what are essentially two versions of the same product, similar to the English and Italian versions, really.  It makes sense that these should be considered the same thing.  This could be done with them actually being "alternative titles" or "alternative versions" of the same entry in the database.  Alternatively, they could be completely separate, with no "Whole Game" category.  I don't like this at all, because it would likely mean that I end up seeing supplements at the same level as actual games (I don't want to see "Complete Beggarman when I'm looking for my group's next game).  Better, I think, would be a more-detailed classification system.  Here, game products should be broken down as "Base games" and "Supplements" or something similar.  Ratings of the whole game should incorporate the ratings of the whole game, as well as those from the "Base game" ratings.  This resolves the weird disparity of ratings for something like FreeMarket, while still letting details like "They destroyed the game with the revised edition!" or "They fixed everything in the new version!" be apparent.<br/><br/>At the very least, if they are not going to change the voting system to better accommodate non-supplement based games, they need to provide much more explicit instructions as to what the different product levels (game vs game product) are for, and how ratings should work for each.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brenton" title="Brenton"><img alt="Brenton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brenton">Brenton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312063/#Comment_312063" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T10:58:09+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 10:58AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As one other, probably best, alternative, games should at least be organized hierarchically.

This generally goes:<br/><br/><code>[Family]<br/>   [RPG #1]<br/>       [RPG Item #1a]<br/>       [RPG Item #1b]<br/>       [RPG Item #1c]<br/>   [RPG #2]<br/>       [RPG Item #2a]<br/>       [RPG Item #2b]</code><br/>etc.<br/><br/>The only tangible things in this hierarchy are the [RPG Item] entries. These are the books we buy. The products we download. The map packs and miniature lines we purchase. The [RPG] is simply a container - it is the larger 'game' being played. Some [RPG]s only have one core book (this is the model of many small-press or "Indie" games). Some [RPG]s have more than one book - Burning Wheel (Revised Edition) is an RPG... it consists of a number of books (Monster Burner, Character Burner, Magic Burner, Adventure Burner, etc).  You can rate the individual items and you can rate the RPG. When you rate the RPG, you're rating how you like "Burning Wheel" as a game. This is related but independent of how you enjoyed every book ever produced for it (so, if you thought Adventure Burner sucked, you can give that a lower rating than you might give the game as a whole).<br/><br/>The [Family] container is the highest level and groups related RPGs. For lines like D&amp;D, we have an overall [FAMILY] of "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" which contains a number of editions of the game: Original 0e, Basic, AD&amp;D 1e, AD&amp;D 2e, 3.0, 3.5 and now 4e. You can rate any of those RPGs as games you play and you can rate any of the sourcebooks individually. Just because AD&amp;D 1e produced the fairly poor Wilderness Survival Guide doesn't mean you have to rate the AD&amp;D 1e game as a whole poorly.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect system, but then again RPG lines are complex (World of Darkness and Traveller nearly destroyed months of work on the hierarchy before we revised it to accommodate those lines).<br/><br/>We consider a book that is 98.3% (precisely arbitrary) the same to be the same book but a different [Version]. Foreign translations, books reprinted with a minor cover image update (witness the 6+ versions of the AD&amp;D 1e Dungeon Master's Guides), a reprint with errata, etc. This way we can have all 30+ printings of the 3.5 D&amp;D Player's Handbook in our system as the same item (i.e. we won't treat the Spanish version differently than the French or US version, nor would we treat the October 2003 revised edition with a few pages of errata included to be separate from the original printing).<br/><br/>Now, with FreeMarket, there is one RPG (the game, which currently has an 8.0 rating out of 10) and three books:<br/><br/><a href="http://rpggeek.com/geeksearch.php?action=search&amp;objecttype=rpgunified&amp;q=Freemarket&amp;B1=Go" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpggeek.com/geeksearch.php?action=search&amp;objecttype=rpgunified&amp;q=Freemarket&amp;B1=Go</a><br/><br/>The three books are: CHOIRS, Freemarket Beta and Freemarket Limited Edition. The beta and LE release were considered less than 98.3% the same and so they got split. We could argue that they should be versions of eachother - that can be easily accomplished. We can argue that the beta never got released to a reasonable sized group (I got one), and remove it. But currently you can rate any of the three products independently of the game. For games where the entire game is one book, this seems a bit dubious... but it's actually possible to really love a game <i>despite</i> how poorly edited the book was (typos, confusing rules, etc). For these reasons we have the rankings independent.  <br/><br/>Speaking of which, on the RPG Geek you can look at rankings by RPG or by RPG Item. We provide both.<br/><br/><a href="http://rpggeek.com/browse/rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpggeek.com/browse/rpg</a><br/><br/><a href="http://rpggeek.com/browse/rpgitem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpggeek.com/browse/rpgitem</a><br/><br/>When you rate an RPG or an RPG Item you get clear guidelines on a 1-10 rating for the 'game' vs for the 'products'. We also put this information in the RPG Geek User Guide (which I wrote so I'll take blame for any confusion with it).<br/><br/>Our hierarchy has other ways of grouping items as well, but it's less formal. We call them 'rubber bands' - and they include things like [series] and [setting]. So you can easily find all [Dark Sun] settings for AD&amp;D 2e -- this is a subset of all the AD&amp;D 2e products in our system. You can equally find all modules in the [B-BASIC] Dungeons &amp; Dragons line (and see them by relative ranking if you want). We can also use these soft rubber bands to group the really odd things like Traveller or Conan which has seen releases in a number of vastly different systems... including GURPS.<br/><br/><br/>Our new article system is being populated so that every RPG Magazine, Zine, Newsletter and Flyer is being cataloged. Our podcast system is up and running capturing all feeds from all shows. In a matter of months I can type in 'Jared Sorensen' and see every article you've ever written, every interview you've ever done, every product you've ever worked on and every podcast in which you appeared. I find that kinda cool.<br/><br/>With almost 25000 RPG Item products in our database grouped under 3000 RPGs, this system has held up reasonably well. It's overkill for many Indie/Story games but serviceable.<br/><br/>Lastly, we've <i>finally</i> got a Microbadge to show support for the Story Games site. It's cute: <img alt="image" src="http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic969085.png"/><br/><br/>Feel free to contact me on RPG Geek (username=wavemotion) and I'll get one sent your way.<br/><br/>-Dave Bernazzani<br/><a href="/forums/profile/rpggeek">@rpggeek</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320589/#Comment_320589" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T13:07:07+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  1:07PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a pretty savvy guy (i think) but for the life of me i can't figure out how to go about rating a game.

I've been one of the most vocal about a re-design and although it's taken some time, they have been working with a professional User Interface contractor and are nearing the end of a six-month redesign of the interface. The redesign will go through beta in May and likely start to roll out to the public not long after. Even those of us who are long-time users of the site and have mastered the cockpit-like front page are pretty excited about a streamlined, modernized and highly manageable interface.<br/><br/>To help you navigate the current interface, however, the <a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/wiki/page/User_Guide" rel="nofollow">User Guide</a> I wrote will help.

It's one of the few sites that uses the data as the center around which <i>everything </i>takes place. While there are general forums, much of the discussion takes place with database items as the central focus. Every RPG, RPG Item, series, setting and family in our database has forums attached to it. This means that you can discuss Fiasco on the forums attached to that specific RPG. Fiasco has the following forums:<br/><br/><code>| Reviews | Sessions | General | GMs Only | Rules | House Rules | News | Play By Forum | </code><br/><br/>The idea is that people can subscribe to a few (well, as many as they like) RPGs and get notices of any activity going on in those forums. With 25000 items (and growing), this is important so that you can get content you're interested in. Furthermore, when someone finds the entry for Fiasco, they can immediately see every session report, review, general discussion, news, house rules or PBF that has taken place for it since the beginning of time. The system is smart enough to aggregate all discussion, news, reviews and reports from items contained under and RPG entry (so if you subscribe to the RPG "Pathfinder" you will get discussion related to the Pathfinder game and <i>all</i> of the sourcebooks released for it... or you can just subscribe/view individual products if you're not interested in the whole ball of wax). In addition, GeekLists allow one to create their own listings to mix and match RPGs, RPG Items, Series, Settings, Genres, etc. into a related list which allows open discussion by users of the site. In short, almost everything stems from the data itself.<br/><br/>This data-centric paradigm is not the way most sites handle their forums and so is unfamiliar to new users. We're aware that the model needs a better interface to attract users. The Geek sites has been immensely popular (we will approach a half-million registered users sometime late in 2011)  but its use comes with a steep learning curve. I can only imagine the popularity of the site with a streamlined and intuitive interface. Hopefully soon.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Christopher">@Christopher</a> you're welcome.

Three for every designer, publisher, artist, production staffer (about 40000 of those) plus forums for every genre, series and setting. I'd estimate about 400k forums.  It's all just data hooked into the master database schema.<br/><br/>They are united by two things - one is the database itself. The point of having forums attached to every item is that you can (days, months or years later) look at an item (say, the AD&amp;D 1e Player's Handbook) and see every bit of forum discussion, reviews, plays, ratings, rankings, etc. attached to it. No searching required - you can also see who owns it, who rated it, what comments they left for it, who has it for trade, for sale and links to any off-site resources for it. You can also subscribe at the item or RPG level and be notified of activity in those sub-forums only.<br/><br/>The second way these are united is on the front page - a new post to any RPG Item or RPG or Designer or Artist, etc. is aggregated into the front page which showcases all of the new forum content. So on most sites you would post a question about Fiasco in the General Forums and in the description or title add the word 'Fiasco'. With the Geek you just post under the forums for Fiasco - anyone subscribed to the game will get a notification (either GeekMail, email or RSS feed -- your choice) that some new content for Fiasco is available. In addition, the new post shows up on the front page as simply new content for those who just want to see all the latest discussions... the front page module will pre-pend "FIASCO" to the post and provide a direct link to the game in the database.  A year from now a person can be looking at the Fiasco entry and see the relevant discussion that took place at any point in time.<br/><br/>It's an unusual model to be sure. And the interface needs to be cleaned up (and is being worked on) ... but the site will always remain data-centric (that is, all activity is centered around an entry in the database - be it a Genre, RPG, RPG Item, Designer, Artist, etc).<br/><br/>-Dave                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320781/#Comment_320781" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T10:54:23+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 10:54AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's true, I was being a bit unfair.

These general forums are piped into a module on the front page. These are forums that exist outside any single item in the database. We handle general chit-chat through these forums... general discussion on the industry, someone looking for recommendations on what game to pick, industry news, things like GenCon or the Ennies, charity auctions, contests and promo give-aways and a myrid of other topics. We also have a <b>Tavern</b> for off topic banter which is very popular. Finally, a user can create a <b>Guild</b> which can be used as a sub-group with their own semi-private forums. There are thousands of Guilds now on the Geek - ones for various regions around the world, local game groups, organizations who want to have their own place to discuss things, etc. I belong to the Unity Games Guild (our local Eastern MA boardgame group) as well as Guild Scatter (my local group of role-players).  RPG Geek is both a database and a community and can be used as either (or, in my case, both).<br/><br/>-Dave                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320792/#Comment_320792" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T11:21:51+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 11:21AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the BGG forums model.
