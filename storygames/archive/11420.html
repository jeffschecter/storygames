My hand is <i>provisionally</i> up -- I personally get weirded out when I find myself either playing in, or running, a game in which violence has become abstract and cartoony. Sometimes, occasionally, I can loosen up a bit if abstract, cartoony violence is, you know, in-genre. But the "cartoony" (i.e. unrealistic in both its execution and consequences) thing is important if I'm not gonna get viscerally upset by the violence.<br/><br/>But otherwise? Ew. No. Violence has its place at the table but it either needs to be built into the assumptions of the genre/setting/theme/whatever we're playing or it needs to be used very carefully.<br/><br/>I know this is a well-traveled path and I know a lot of folks pay lip service to saying "no" to gratuitous violence in their games, but for serious here: Can you enjoy a game, like say D&amp;D (among others!), in which the execution of violence seems to be the very point baked into the game? What are your boundaries, if any? Is it "okay" to just cut loose and make-believe that you're killing shit left and right?

I decided I would never run the game again and that I would only play it under extreme circumstances.<br/><br/>But then, recently we started playing Pathfinder (which is, frankly, just D&amp;D with another name) and we decided to take it completely non-seriously. We actually stressed "No roleplaying!" as a rule at the table. It was all extremely self-referential and blatantly exploitative and all that jazz...and it was GREAT FUN. <br/><br/>For example, whoever we killed (even the local shopkeep) turned out to have been the bad guy all along, so we retconned all our violence to have been justified, leaving our reputation as "heroes" perfectly clean. All interactions with the locals and attempts at sane human interaction degraded within moments into thieving, lying, killing and worse.<br/><br/>Now, personally, I found this a very illuminating experience, a commentary on the form. Our social contract shifted from "we are playing a game where we pretend we're elves" to "we're playing <i>D&amp;D</i>". It was hilarious and it was liberating and it was a little bit scary. It was self-aware to the max, referencing, challenging and destroying everything we had projected into the game since our adolescence.</span><br/><br/>Ok, now to address some of the stuff in your post directly:<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>But the "cartoony" (i.e. unrealistic in both its execution and consequences) thing is important if I'm not gonna get viscerally upset by the violence.</blockquote>\nHow do you react to non-cartoony violence in other media, like movies or literature? <br/>I think the cartoonizing of violence can sometimes do more bad than good. It's like censure, but worse in the way that it still depicts something, but censures the <i>consequences</i>. And consequences are the thing that should teach about responsibility I believe. I like games that depict violence responsibly, regardless of its portrayal as gratuitous or realistic or whatever.<br/>On the other hand, if you're already aware of the horrible nature of violence, I understand that making it unrealistic can provide some padding if it's a sensitive subject to you...\n<blockquote><br/>But otherwise? Ew. No. Violence has its place at the table but it either needs to be built into the assumptions of the genre/setting/theme/whatever we're playing or it needs to be used very carefully.<br/></blockquote>\nThing is, for a lot of genres violence is a very basic assumption. Even more so, human nature can be said to be fundamentally violent, even if we don't like to hear it.\n<blockquote>I know this is a well-traveled path and I know a lot of folks pay lip service to saying "no" to gratuitous violence in their games, but for serious here: Can you enjoy a game, like say D&amp;D (among others!), in which the execution of violence seems to be the very point baked into the game? What are your boundaries, if any? Is it "okay" to just cut loose and make-believe that you're killing shit left and right? If so, how is that "okay" but cutting loose and playing make-believe about other forms of violence (rape, emotional abuse, socioeconomic injustice, whatever) not-okay?</blockquote>\nSo ok, back to my story. After NOT enjoying D&amp;D at all, because it wasn't catering to my story-gaming needs, I ran/played D&amp;D as what it was: a game where "the execution of violence seems to be the very point baked into the game" as you say, and this helped me enjoy it again. But if we were playing anything else and the players behaved in the same way, I'd stop right there and call them all dysfunctional psychopaths. <br/><br/>So the boundaries definitely shift with the genre/setting/premise/game. All forms of violence are valid themes that can be addressed in a meaningful way. But frankly, sometimes we just want to see blood. <br/><br/>It's like enjoying both The Seventh Seal and Rambo 4, but on obviously different levels. I don't think there's anything unusual about that; we are accustomed to feel cognitive dissonance when presented with two seemingly opposing ideas ("I'm sure I like red, how can I like green, too?!"), but as far as I'm concerned the paradoxical nature of our thoughts (including the experience of <i>fun</i>) is fundamentally human.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254265/#Comment_254265" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T10:28:59+00:00" title="February  1, 2010 10:28AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a man, and as such have a built-in drive for the fight.

The closest we come is a sense of disappointment and lack of control when I get into a game with new people and they prove to be playing a completely different game from what I'm doing. I can vividly remember a session of <i>Dust Devils</i> in 2005 or so; there were two players in the game who were just messing about without caring for the fictional situation, fictional consequences or who their characters were. This sort of thing can get ugly in a standard forgista game like DD, because the GM's job in this sort of game is to basically throw out Bangs and their consequences. In this case it meant an increasing spiral of violence and atrocity as the problem players answered every problem they could comprehend with violence, killing and brutalizing the poor citizens and then engaging the rest of the player characters in a tedious and meaningless siege/gunfight.<br/><br/>I was annoyed by the above and uncertain of how to deal with it socially, as most of the group was new to me, but socially functional, while these two acted like 14-year olds and ignored all instruction and signals of how to play the game. I'd have to say that while violence had a role, it was not the violence that bothered me per se, but the inhumanly psychopath characters painted for our benefit by these two players. Their violence had no reason, and I was sort of stuck as a vehicle of the violence porn, being the GM and responsible for handling the consequences - a part of which was depicting the human costs of the choices made by these players, and trying my darnedest to make the NPCs somehow sympathetic and meaningful so they wouldn't shoot any more of them without good reason.<br/><br/>It's easy to see that violence wasn't the crux issue in the above vignette, but the fact that we had a mix of players who communicated on different levels - the perpetrators here didn't realize that they were annoying and creeping out the rest of the group by creating atrocities in the fiction but refusing to carry the moral consequences for their characters by becoming clear-cut villains of the piece or otherwise acknowledging the human cost of what their characters did. The specific in-fiction violence would have been fine if we had understood why their characters acted. I've also had similar experiences that have not involved violence, but have otherwise flouted the fiction due to earnest but clueless players using the wide discretionary powers some games give to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254276/#Comment_254276" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T11:03:42+00:00" title="February  1, 2010 11:03AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha, yes -- I've also (occasionally) found myself in the unwelcome role of violence porn facilitator.

Violence solves problems. In fact, ONLY violence actually effectively solves problems.<br/><br/>This one is particularly an RPG thing, but it's very much out there in the culture at large, too. In RPGs, it probably comes from a long history of combat being the one arena of play in which there were hard rules and concrete consequences. I've often run into the attitude (and can remember having it myself at certain times) that the only way to be SURE of a "win" in play was the the Clear The Level strategy - kill absolutely everything that you can. Deals won't stick, prisoners are a huge headache, and enemies left alive will inevitably return with buddies &amp; powerups later.<br/><br/>The lesser version of this (violence solves problems, but it isn't the ONLY thing that does) provides much fertile ground for play (DitV, anyone?) but still flirts with some nasty ideas from time to time. It's all a bit fascist.<br/><br/>Then again, I enjoy superhero comics, and you don't get much more fascist than that.<br/><br/>2. Violence is both graphic/realistic and morally trivial, aka "violence porn"<br/><br/>Possible to get right, but NOT easy. Played as black comedy, parody, and the like this CAN be fun and non-ugly, but it's rarely successful in my experience. Usually it's just empowerment/revenge fantasy or shock/gross-out.<br/><br/>I like my violence either sufficiently cartoonish and steeped in genre convention to reach the "good clean fun" level of a good dungeon bash, or IF it's going to be serious, to be damned serious.<br/><br/>It's like anything else "serious" in game: everybody's got to be more or less on the same page about what's acceptable. I think my biggest frustration with violence has been relative to other things - there are great kerfuffles and much rending of garments about the slightest hint of gender, class, race, politics, religion, what-have-you intruding into many games, but the baseline assumption that a game will inevitably contain problem-solving through unproblematized application of extreme force is as common as dirt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254291/#Comment_254291" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T11:59:46+00:00" title="February  1, 2010 11:59AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I don't think of that sort of thing as a serious problem, mostly because it's really rare. It must be about one in a hundred roleplayers who is so detached from social niceties and creative cooperation that they can just barge into a game and do their thing without trying to pick up the cues from the other players. I only remember meeting a few gamers like that, and the one I know best is actually an on-and-off mental patient. It's a fluke, the great majority of people I sit down to play something like <i>Dust Devils</i> with are perfectly able to look around them and understand what it is that the others are doing.<br/><br/>The normal situation with game violence for practically all of us, I expect, is that we consider it purely in the game's own gamey frame. In a commando skirmish game like D&amp;D, of course there's going to be violence, but it doesn't bother us because it's just pawns in a game, the same as chess. And then there are the various dramatic games where we do observe the violence as violence, but even then we're routinely protected by genre and Aristotelic story structures; the violence is detached because it's imaginary and formulaic in a way. Only when we encounter the violence as violence porn, detached from dramatic or strategic framework, do we get bothered by it. This is all pretty natural, I think.<br/><br/>From the above viewpoint it seems that creepy violence in a rpg is actually really easy to replicate: just make the violence gratuitous in a way that lacks any justifying framework such as a strategy game or dramatic plot, and describing the violence or listening to it will rather soon start to seem sick. I've actually sort of made use of this phenomenon in various horror games to make the impact of the gore perfectly clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254293/#Comment_254293" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T12:04:31+00:00" title="February  1, 2010 12:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Insert stuff everybody has heard too many times about D&amp;D's alignment system here.]<br/><br/>D&amp;D isn't a game about looking at the rightness or wrongness of violence and its effects in the world.  It's a game about sitting down with your friends, getting into a conflict with [GM's favorite mook race here], and then prevailing to fight another larger mook on another day.  It's generally kill or be killed.  Much like every single video game ever made.<br/><br/>Mario doesn't drink himself into a stupor trying to forget all the goombas he's crushed.  Luigi never has to deal with little teary-eyed koopa troopas asking him why he de-shelled their father and then spitefully used the shell to destroy all his friends.<br/><br/>I think it may be interesting to see somebody write a D&amp;D hack that mechanically coerced the players to look at morality a little more closely.

I mean that I can't engage on an emotional or personal level.  My character is a pawn, and it's about playing optimally for the group and the game.

Sometimes that means killing armies in Risk, or loading "colonists" on boats in Puerto Rico, and putting them to work on the plantation, sometimes it means stabbing my buddy in Diplomacy.<br/><br/>There are games and other entertainment forms out there where I don't have to do this.  Dogs, for an example, is pretty steeped in violence, but the game is constructed in such a way that it confronts and challenges that, rather than accepts it as "the way things work."<br/><br/>But yeah, for a lot of the media that's out there, not just games, I have to do this kind of disengagement or I end up being seriously creeped and disturbed.

This is evident in D&amp;D as well - the normal D&amp;D narrative involves violence for heroic, justified purposes, in display of courage in the face of adversity, in defence of civilization against barbarism and weak against the strong. That sort of stuff is entirely fundamental to masculine identity, I might say that we as a culture need it to have our men grow righteous and responsible. This goes for roleplaying games as well as other media - we want violence in our narratives, but we want it to be righteous violence.<br/><br/>Thus, one clear-cut answer to the original query about D&amp;D is that violence in D&amp;D is not bothersome because it is presented unambiguously within this established narrative of righteous violence. If you can accept that narrative (at least for dramatic purposes) in other media, it will prove no greater problem in roleplaying games, either. It is probably for this reason that the easiest way of making the violence in D&amp;D creepy and disgusting is to break the rules of righteous war we know from our cultural conditioning - have the PCs harass non-combatants, initiate fights with a profit motivation and so on. This is also a likely reason for why the same game events can bother one person while they don't bother another; when you have slight differences in your acculturation to the use of violence, you read the subtext differently, and then one person's righteous war becomes another's human rights crime. I might hazard a guess that attitudes to colonialism are a major fault line in this regard when we consider D&amp;D; in our society today it is entirely possible for one person to grow up with a keen awareness of ethnic minority rights and what conquistadorialism looks like in reality, while another grows up on a nationalistic narrative, perhaps with a goodly dash of the white man's burden mixed in. Put those two people at a table and ask them to play a game about professional mercenaries who strive to strike it rich by wandering the countryside and trying to "discover" a "lost" treasure, and you'll find that they'll interpret the subtext quite differently.<br/><br/>It would be simplistic to exonerate D&amp;D entirely of critique here, because societal standards change and what was politically acceptable in pulp literature during the '30s or '60s and what is acceptable today are different things. Thus, even if Gygax et all. originally intended their game to be politically neutral (which is likely to my mind), it need not be that anymore once the society's value landscape changes. From a modern viewpoint D&amp;D has a pretty mercenary worldview, just like much of pulp fantasy - if you'll read Fritz Leiber, for instance, you'll find the same idea of an uncaring world and society, one in which protagonists make their way by their wit and sword, their foremost goal being to scrapple their way up from immediate poverty and into the tyrannical and arbitrary ruling class they find themselves arrayed against. This is where D&amp;D comes from, and it can be seen in the mercenary way the game runs on gold coins and killing expertise. The most original core D&amp;D experience does not involve defensive war against an aggressive enemy like it often does today; rather, the core experience is for a bunch of independent adventurers to delve into the wilderness to "find" treasure. This is proactive activity, the same as colonial exploration and exploitation.<br/><br/>Still, the basic point is valid, that point being that D&amp;D is intended to run within the framework of just war, even if those limits have shifted since the game was first written. Today a GM might need to motivate player characters more and make sure that the enemy they steal their gold from is really and truly evil enough to make the game work; this is all because our own value landscapes are different from what they were 50 years ago, most of us find it more difficult to accept the premise of enterpreneurial, conquistadoric slaughter the game originally offers. Even as it is fantasy, people sometimes don't want to get involved in such a fantasy. I could easily see how one might write an upgraded game that removed this tension altogether even today, though - you just need to make sure that the copious violence in your game all happens clearly within the framework of justified, chivalric warfare, whatever the audience understands with that, and you'll find that they'll have no trouble whatsoever with engaging with the game. I am rather certain that D&amp;D would lose plenty of its glamour in this sort of process, though; art works on edginess and identity, and watering down the Conanesque "by the might of my thews" from the game would spoil something that's likely considered the best part by many. I know that I myself enjoy this literary genre and rpgs made of it, even if I am aware of the faults in the worldview behind the exercise when implemented in the real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254337/#Comment_254337" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T15:21:55+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  3:21PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite>In one D&amp;D game I played - about 10 years ago now - I found it strategically prudent to have my rogue sneak into the lair of our enemy, kill him in his sleep, remove his head, and then take the head out to the middle of the forest for my awaiting party members.  When I looked back on what I had narrated, I felt physically ill.  I mean, for the sake of winning a larger conflict without putting my friends in danger, what I did made logical sense.  But, dang, it was messed up.</blockquote>That reminds me of a Shadowrun game I played in.<br/><br/>The idea was "Shadowrunners trying to lie down in their old neighborhood after a run went bad", basically an excuse to run "professional" Runners in a gang environment. So we checked up a couple of contacts, got ourselves into a local gang and then proceeded to get into a fight with, I think, some opposing gang. All fine and dandy, with the fight being typical "action movie" level violence. It might even have been a fists-and-knifes-fight, as opposed to a gunfight or whatever.<br/><br/>Until one of the other players decided that the best way to project strength and, dunno, GET PEOPLE TO TRUST US was to whip out his <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dick</span> Katana and decapitate the enemy gang leader, before triumphantly stomping on the headless corpse and waving the head around.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>This was a couple of years ago and I had neither the emotional distance nor the maturity to call TIME OUT and actually address why I felt that this wasn't ok and so the following pseudo-discussion was more about how being a sociopathic, murdering maniac is generally not how you get people to trust you and how it ruined the plan. In hindsight, though, what bugged me was that this was just not the game I wanted to play in. I was hoping for something more human(e), with people a focus on relationships and the people of the neighborhood and I felt that this was generally how the other players and the GM had approached it, too. (Which may or may not be just me imagining things.) I also realize that this was probably an expression of the players frustration with the game and the GM (Who most of us hadn't games with before this game and people were still not all that comfortable with each others egos and visions.) as well as other, real-life issues.<br/><br/>So, as so often, the issue wasn't the violence per-se, the missmatch was only a symptom of a general failing in the social level of the game, but it's still interesting how often these OOG concerns are expresssed as violent ingame behavior.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Ah, to be there again with what I know now... :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254341/#Comment_254341" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T15:41:39+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  3:41PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2010 3:49PM by creases.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Hi all. I'm only an occasional poster, long time lurker, but I had an opinion on this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we don't take the word "violence" too too broadly, it's fair to say that D&amp;D 4e provides options for playing non-violent characters. Let me qualify that. 4e provides options for playing characters who only fight defensively and non-lethally.<br/>\n<br/>\nFormer editions penalized you for choosing to do non-lethal damage when using a lethal weapon, typically as a negative modifier to your attack roll. 4e doesn't do this. In the Rules As Written, if you want any attack to be non-lethal when you reduce the enemy to 0 hp, you say "I want to knock it unconscious, not kill it", and the DM says "Okay" and takes that into account when narrating the enemy's defeat. There's no mechanical effect, except you don't lower the enemy's hp below 0.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a foe is bloodied, you can also use the Intimidate skill vs their Will to force a surrender. Players then have the option of capturing them, routing them, or what have you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it would be rather tough to play a character that never used force at all, especially if you understood, eg. fear powers to count as "force". I wonder whether you couldn't pull it off with a wizard or druid, though, focusing on zone and wall powers. I haven't tried. But I think it would be worth exploring.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game assumes a high level of violence; you are fighting evil or at least aggressive monsters. But there's not really anything preventing you from setting things up so that the PCs only use force in response to violence or the imminent threat thereof, only as a last resort, and exploring the consequences afterward.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeremy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254345/#Comment_254345" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T15:49:50+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  3:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2010 3:50PM by Brand_Robins.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have two basic problems with violence in RPGs. <br/><br/>The first is that a lot of RPG violence is dull. Fucking deadly dull. It is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. If I  never have yet another dull as fuck fight with dull as fuck opponents for no fucking reason other than someone wanted a fight in the game, I'll be just as happy. <br/><br/>Do not bore me with your idiot violence. <br/><br/>The second is tied to the first, but sits at a different philosophical level. I often find that one of the reasons the violence is dull is that it is unexamined, boy-story wankery without any understanding of, or appreciation for, actual violence and the real problems of violence. (Including the necessity of violence or the actual visceral thrill of real violence.) It's formulaic, regurgitated movie pablum that is not only dull but mildly ethically disturbing because of the very vacuousness with which it is approached. <br/><br/>I've had characters in games choke their mother to death, with descriptions of the feeling of muscles giving under the strain of their fingers, and not been bothered by it. (Moved by it, yes, but moved and bothered aren't the same thing. Ditto disturbed by it.)

The issue is a good one, though - can you conduct yourself ethically wrong by enjoying the wrong entertainments? I wrote some pretty tedious arguments to counter the idea in that other thread. I could see that it's contrary to virtue theory to enjoy pablum uncritically, but there's a difference between being unvirtuous and being wrong.<br/><br/>I really should get out of that Maid discussion, though, it's starting to tire me out. I'm in the middle of a pretty mechanical manual layout procedure and writing stream-of-consciousness posts here relaxes the tension (explains why I've been uncharacteristically active here this last week), but I can't help but find that it's pretty pointless to engage in philosophical discourses on a web forum.

Or run a game with nonviolent PCs? Someone who uses force only reluctantly and discriminately, or even an outright pacifist who won't fight even defensively? What system were you using, and did it support other means for accomplishing the character's ends? Was it overall a positive experience, or unfun?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are good systems for encouraging nonviolent character concepts, or at least not penalizing them? I suggested D&amp;D 4e, above. Others that come to mind: I reckon there is nothing standing in the way of a nonviolent concept in Diaspora, where you can usually make Composure attacks just as easily as Health attacks, with the same weapons. I can imagine aspects that might come into play for those kinds of attacks, like "Stop or I'll shoot!", or "I always fire warning shots." Similarly, in Dogs in the Vineyard, I could define a whole whack of Traits that revolve around persuasion, diplomacy, or intimidation. I might find myself escalating to talking conflict often, even when weapons have already come out; in fact, I might build a strategy on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can GMs do to encourage players to make interesting and surprising choices regarding their use of violence, or to reflect on violence? Especially without throwing violence in their faces or using it exploitatively (like that guy in the D&amp;D doc who used rape as a divine punishment for a female player's female PC).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me there are two kinds of "nonviolent" stories. First: those in which violence doesn't really occur much at all, and all the conflict is social in nature. What sorts of scenarios will players find compelling? Especially those used to more violent games?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond: those in which violence occurs often, and the players have to find nonviolent or nonlethal but productive ways of confronting it or otherwise addressing it. These games involve a lot of violence from the GM's side of things, and conventional RPG scenarios might be easier to adapt to this style of play. But, in this case, it seems to me there have to be factors in play that reward nonviolent choices on the part of the players, and maybe even those that penalize violent choices. They might be mechanical or even just story-based; eg., if your Diaspora character kills someone he oughtn't to have in personal combat, you segue into a social combat representing his manslaughter trial.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat sorts of things can game designers do to promote nonviolent play?<br/>\n<br/>\nJeremy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254537/#Comment_254537" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T13:34:02+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  1:34PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: creases</cite>What sorts of things can game designers do to promote nonviolent play?</blockquote>In Burning Wheel, you're taking a huge risk by getting into a violent situation.

Making combat deadlier is a negative incentive; you avoid combat because you risk a lot by engaging in it. That's different from a positive incentive, where you avoid combat because there are more effective ways of accomplishing your character's goals. The difference is especially important in games where combat is especially deadly BUT there are no more effective ways of playing the character. That's a pretty basic way to sabotage a nonviolent character concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, I'm curious about games that support and reward effective nonviolent ways to resolve potentially violent conflicts in-story (even if the nonviolent means are actions taken in "combat", like D&amp;D 4e's Powers used nonlethally, or Diaspora's Composure attacks).<br/>\n<br/>\nJeremy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254610/#Comment_254610" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T17:40:40+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  5:40PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bevedog</cite>I have never played Farmville, but I expect that there is probably tactics and strategy involved.</blockquote>\nIt is worth playing just so you can see what the fuss is about, and believe me, there is a GIANT FRICKIN FUSS.

The robbery is an additional incentive, sure, but the protection of regular folks is the main deal.<br/>Except most players, when provided with such a hook will say: "What's in it for us?" and walk on to the next town with the exact same problem except it's offering 10gp per goblin skull. Really, what's in there for you if you're only saving people? Experience? Great, but I'm still worthless if I advance to Fighter lvl.5 and don't have a magic sword. Loot/gold is an essential part of the reward mechanic. Admittedly 4E made magic items a little less important, but still.<br/><br/>Plus the fact that while the books advise giving XP for various things, most DMs have it sort of hardwired into their brain that you only get XP for combat. Even I can't help it. You just helped those villagers get across the river? Cool, let's move on. You just killed a whole tribe of small yellow semi-people? 10.000 XP! It's disgusting in a way, but hey, that's D&amp;D. I now think the best way to play it is total disconnect from the fiction. If you can *immerse* in a typical D&amp;D character, you're probably a psycho.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254705/#Comment_254705" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T06:36:30+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  6:36AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been stewing over this thread for awhile, because I have played games with violence in them without problems, and then in other games the violence will turn my stomach. D&amp;D is one of those games that I had a real problem with the violence in them and couldn't figure out why. Eventually, I figured out it wasn't really the violence that bothered me but the alignment system backing it up. In D&amp;D, murder is absolutely morally just as long as the people you are murdering are evil. For some reason I'm okay with a game full of elves and fireballs, but try to get me to buy into a good-and-evil morality scheme and I get a headache.<br/><br/>I once played a serial killer paladin back in 3rd ed., a fantasy world Dexter, because I had a hard time taking the alignment system seriously. He would locate victims using Detect Evil and then stalk them and kill them. It simultaneously amused and frustrated my GM and fellow players because my character was clearly a horrible person, but still behaving well within the rules' guidelines for paladin behavior and being Good. Lawful was a bit fuzzy as we were in a lawless domain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254710/#Comment_254710" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T07:03:46+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  7:03AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy,<br/><br/>How familiar are you with many of the "story games" that led to this site getting its name?

I wanted a DOg that used Ceremony and Oration and just Made Sense to even the sinners.<br/><br/>How did it impact the actual narrative? Well, I had to go up against the other Dogs, to try to have a seriously fucked up town disseminated into several other towns (basically a Trail of Tears thing, but for Mormons, not Native Americans). Meanwhile, the Real Offenders were frog-marched back to Bridal Falls for "re-education." In short, I did little to no "violence," but as a "moral agent," I tore apart families and a whole community, dividing the Faithful from the Faithless (leaving the latter in a lurch, as such towns can't survive losing more than half their population!).<br/><br/>It was a fun and challenging game, if only because I had to think outside the box of "talk 'em down, hold 'em down, knock 'em down, gun 'em down" approach to sinners and sorcerers.

When it becomes easy.<br/><br/>* When violence is the first and best solution to any problem.<br/><br/>* When violence is motivated by stuff like greed, assuming that playing a game about killing and stealing (and the consequences of doing so) isn't the point of the game.

In the last D&amp;D 4e campaign I ran -- namely Metrocalypse, if you've been following along -- these giant ants start disassembling the home-base town of Oxford brick by brick and building this 100-foot-high ant mountain. The PCs investigate and try to put a stop to it.<br/><br/>We at least spent three evenings on it. Night one, fighting ants in the city and trying to enter the mound and slaying many ants. Night two, exploring the first couple "dungeon levels" of the mound and slaying many more ants. Night three, finally fighting their way to the queen's chamber. They were spoiling for a big boss fight.<br/><br/>And the ant queen starts talking to them, albeit by jamming an antenna into the corpse of some human her ants captured, but she apologized for that. She begged the adventurers for mercy and asked them with great sadness why they were killing all of her children. She said, if they wanted, she'd move the colony out of the city and leave Oxford alone. And the players, who had waited two evenings to get to fight the big mean queen, backed down and accepted her deal. <br/><br/>I felt kinda crappy about it as a DM but I had set it up this way, from the start. They just never thought to stop and figure out if the colony could be reasoned with. And who can blame them? These were all mindless ants until this encounter. Part of me thinks it was a dick move to spring a talking queen ant on them, but I had planned the encounter from the very start, so it wasn't like I was just retroactively making her talk to shame them. But in a way, it was kinda of an awesome moment in terms of validating that, under it all, the adventurers were decent people, if perhaps a little misguided sometimes. I mean, they could have been all, "ARRR NO YOU DIE!" and killed the queen but they didn't. And I am pretty sure I gave them full XP for the encounter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254754/#Comment_254754" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T09:48:14+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  9:48AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>But anyway, Paul, can you tell me about the whole gratuitous part of this gratuituos violence thing that got you posting this originally?

In most published modules, the motive is protecting some regular folks or stopping bad guys, you know, like a superhero. The robbery is an additional incentive, sure, but the protection of regular folks is the main deal.<br/>Except most players, when provided with such a hook will say: "What's in it for us?" and walk on to the next town with the exact same problem except it's offering 10gp per goblin skull. <br/><br/>That's never been my experience. The players I've played with, when presented with, "these bad guys are doing bad things, please help us" have always been happy to jump in. They've known that the system is set up so that they'll be rewarded for doing that - they'll get treasure and experience, and have the feeling they are doing it for good reasons. I've never ever seen the much-maligned style of play you describe above, and I'm glad. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>My real issue with violence in D&amp;D is that the motive is always robbery. As usually played, I just can't find a way to be comfortable with it any more. I could play it differently but I'd rather play something that already has a different reward cycle.<br/><br/>I have nothing against violence in games or even in violence as the go-to mechanism for problem resolution, but killing everything in sight in order to rifle their pockets squicks me out now. Wasn't always the case.</blockquote>\nHave you ever played Pendragon? That's a game where the rewards are modelled on a mix of history and romance. You get rewarded in glory for defeating opponents. If you defeat opponents, you can take their stuff - it's not looting, it's spoils of war. You can get a huge financial reward for defeating an enemy knight and ransoming him back to his lord - but the catch is, the knight has to be alive. <br/>You could argue that violence in this game is motivated by robbery. In fact, knights can wander off, set themselves up on a road, and demand that any one who wants to pass must face them in combat first, and if the knight wins, he takes their stuff. <br/>So you could easily argue that a major motivation in this game is robbery. But it's such a tiny part of the game, what with heroic quests, struggling to become religious or chivalrous knights, winning the hearts of damsels in distress, etc.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is exactly the same. There is a financial motive for doing certain things. But the players and GM have to bring more to the game (like their understanding of what heroic fiction is like) if they want it to be more than that. Some groups will find that harder than others, but i don't think D&amp;D needs more systemic ways to encourage it: it's built into the GMing advice, and the game descriptions, that this is a heroic game about fighting evil. If players aren't embracing that, and some players don't like it, it's time to discuss that at the social contract level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254917/#Comment_254917" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T21:24:25+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  9:24PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2010 9:26PM by komradebob.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite>D&amp;D is exactly the same.

Which, I think is true. but the settings you describe are perfectly workable within the system too. My basic point was, characters should do things for character-based reasons, the sort of reasons that fit in the worlds of Conan and Thieves Worlds work just fine (I was thinking of stories like that, too). Financial motivation is just one facet that fits into these characters world views - but a lot of the time, they have other reasons for acting: revenge, romance, etc. That's what I mean by having a familiarity with the fiction, and letting it inform how you act with your characters. The GM should be providing motivations that fit the player's characters and interest the players, and the players should be telegraphing what sort of things they are interested in, by having well-rounded characters with drives and personalities, and failing that, maybe even just talking about what they want.<br/><br/>If the GM offers the players an adventure hook, and they don't accept it because in the next town they'll get one that pays more, maybe that's a failing in the way the players *and* GM are approaching their play rather than a failing of the game itself.<br/><br/>As an aside, I don't understand how the some of the antics of Conan, Fafyrd &amp; Mouser, and some Thieves World characters should be less disturbing than killing people for their loot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254965/#Comment_254965" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T04:59:39+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  4:59AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Imagine me talking in the outraged voice of 21 from Venture Brothers, like when he's giving the Smurf lecture:<br/><br/>The thing with Han Solo is that he didn't stay a greedy, self-serving person.

And the dungeon generation rules explicitly enforce that 30% of all treasure will be completely unguarded.</blockquote>\nD'oh!<br/><br/>Yes, I was certainly thinking of earlier versions of D&amp;D, which were less Good Heroic on the whole, and more Adventurerish. <br/><br/>Is the clear evidence of that turning point (from adventurers to heroes) being turned Dragonlance?<br/><br/>Actually, purely from personal experience, I remember being a young'un wanting to play Good Heroic style and feeling like D&amp;D wasn't really doing it well, but that was long before I ever encountered the formulation "System Matters". It was also years before I encountered the more "adventurer" style of fiction, and actually saw how it connected with D&amp;D ( I was well into my 20s I think before I ever read Thieves' World or Fritz Leiber's stuff).<br/><br/>As to the basic questions of violence, robbery, and D&amp;D, it might be worth noting how far D&amp;D as played today has wandered from its origin.<br/><br/>IIUC the evolution of the game, the earliest form was essentially a format to give context to a campaign minis game with fantasy flavor.<br/><br/>The game was run with many players, like, a couple dozen. The goal of those players was to enrich and empower their characters, to be more useful to whatever faction they joined or created, once it was time for the big showdowns. Players were kinda on alignment based teams, but each individual player was acting a bit like a player in <i>Diplomacy</i>.<br/><br/>The GM was mostly a neutral referee, and dungeons were mostly small side quests to grab loot ( pays for the armies and the castles which players would eventually build), and power up individually for the big battles. The dungeons were supposed to be kinda stupidly deadly, although not necessarily at tournament levels of deadly. After all, multiple parties might be going into and out of the same dungeons at different times, only partially completing it. Plus, it was good thing for some characters to die and others to outstrip even their (supposed, alignment bloc) team mates. After all, the campaign aspect needed to end at some point, or at least reach the level of the big battles being fought.<br/><br/>Now think about just how far D&amp;D has drifted/evolved from that initial set of circumstances.<br/><br/>Play culture rapidly moved away from the entire many player, minis club/group context where a campaign in the wargamer sense is being played.<br/>Those side-quest things move from being interesting side-quests for loot to being the core of the activity.<br/>Character death moves more and more into taboo territory.<br/>GMs become less neutral referees.<br/>Dungeons become less of a circumstancial ruin to be partially plundered as players and characters are best able, and something to be fully completed.<br/>Without the wargame campaign context with its PvP, play starts haing other contexts (stories/worlds) being provided.<br/>The norm moves away from adenturers who can come together for a delve, then disperse and join other groupings of players/characters for the next delve to permanent teams of constantly improving dungeon-delvers.<br/><br/>To sum up:<br/>There isn't gratuitous violence in D&amp;D in its original context. Violence is core to <i>that</i> D&amp;D.<br/><br/>It is instead that D&amp;D has drifted so far from its roots that we start to see gratuitous violence in it in the newer context that has become the norm. (And realy, that newer context has been there in one form or another for a very long time. I'd date it from D&amp;D achieving fad status and breaking out of the hobbyist gamer ghetto circa 1980).<br/><br/>Problem is, even with 4e, you'e still got that core animal that goes all the way back to the earliest incarnation, and that's where the weird taste combo comes from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254997/#Comment_254997" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T08:45:25+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  8:45AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why hasn't anyone spoken of Paranoia, yet? I mean, come on! The whole premise of the game is that your PC will likely die for random or bizarre reasons, only to be replaced by a carbon copy with no recollection of the "adventure" thus far and no choice but to be thrust into the threshing mill. Talk about dehumanizing--it even is more concerned with a character's social rank (color) than identity or personality or ambitions!<br/><br/>Clearly a horrible, horrible game for sickos.<br/>[/tongue-in-cheek]<br/><br/>More seriously, I think that the focus of this thread is way off base--blaming the system and not its actual play implementation by some. By my (admittedly ancient, AD&amp;D reading) of the game, it's VERY oriented towards heroism, defending honor and the weak, and maturation. The alignment system isn't some veneer or goad--it's a hard-and-fast Physical Law. Like, an inviolate ontological fact of the game universe.<br/><br/>Any sort of post-modern deconstruction that says "evil is just misunderstood" is ITSELF to blame for any hand-wringing and guilt-by-association. Because that's just not the game reality--might as well also say that magic is powered by midichloreans and the planet's magnetic flux, and that halflings are actually humans with a genetic defect.<br/><br/>Evil is EVIL. It breaks into your home, steals your children to use as soup ingredients, gang-rapes your cow to death, and burns down your barn. Sure, some of it is intelligent--it can cleverly taunt you as its pulling out your intestines... slowly... with great economy of motion... like an expert surgeon... while you scream until your vocal chords snap.<br/><br/>Of what relevance, ethically, is the fact that, once this scourges is razed from the land, it's ill-gotten loot would be left just lying around in the ground unless the adventurers take it? Perhaps a TOTALLY, UTTERLY Lawful character would try to determine the provenance of each coin and bit of jewelry, to return it all to its rightful owners (or, more likely, their heirs and next-of-kin!). But heroism has its own costs--especially if your GM takes provisioning and wear-and-tear seriously--and so if you want roving bands of EVIL wiped out, you gotta make some concessions for costs of operation. Loot is not theft; it's operating capital for freelance police. (That said, I can imagine a TON of D&amp;D campaigns revolving around sanction adventuring, with loot going into the Kingdom's Treasury or some-such... just not many folks start with such a premise, in spite of the connotations of being a member of the clergy (cleric), its military arm (paladin), or a mage or thieves guild, etc.)<br/><br/>So, it's not murder, it's policing and pest control. And it's not theft, it's salvage rights and operating costs. And that's all baked right into the ontology of the world. Leave your "real-world," muddy ethics at the door, dry your eyes, and save the angst for Vampire (which DOES build moral uncertainty into its universe!).<br/>[fin]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stryck" title="stryck"><img alt="stryck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stryck">stryck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255002/#Comment_255002" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T09:20:40+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  9:20AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts on it are that i have this inner core of pure rage and hatred that I really really enjoy expressing through gratuitous violence.

It's cathartic.<br/><br/>I can do such things guilt-free in DND, because that's the point of it. Killing things gratuitously, and robbing their still-warm corpses of everything of value, while roaming around righting wrongs and seeking treasure and completing quests.  It ain't about personal growth, people.<br/><br/>But I also enjoy that there are consequences and backlash from violence in (the particular game i'm in of) exalted, and in other games.

I wonder what a D&amp;D; game would look like if DMs framed their adventures according to the principles of just wars and police actions. Force only in response to an injustice, and only as a last resort; only to protect a victim from a threat, to restore a harm done to them, or to avenge an injustice against them; never as retaliation; using the least force necessary to achieve the objective; always accepting surrender; etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n("Right intention" is one of the principles of just war theory. It means, a belligerent ought to be motivated by the injustice he's seeking to address, not monetary gain. War fought for economic gain, or used as a pretext for economic gain, is unjust; at least, so say the philosophers. The folks who have already expressed their distaste at the looting aspect of D&amp;D; might take this as vindication.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy notion is that, in fact, <b>very little</b> would change in terms of how combat works, how the character advances, etc. Especially in 4e. DMs might have to put a little more thought into the question of where treasure is coming from; that's something they always have to keep an eye on, though. The game allows quite a bit of room for story-based rewards, and this might be a good use for them: you get bonus XP for capturing the brigands alive, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeremy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255107/#Comment_255107" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T16:55:58+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  4:55PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite><br>That's never been my experience.

They might be killing goblins because they enjoy killing, not because the farmers asked them to, and they'd still get the xp and loot. <br><br>My comment that you bolded was actually a throwaway comment, a thing in the background. It is not the prime motivator - the prime motivator is whatever the events of the session throw up as the goal. The treasure and/or xp is the icing on the cake, something they don't always get. Sometimes, yes, those things can align. "We need money to improve our castle/finance our drug addiction/whatever, so lets find a paying job, or become outlaws and rob the tax collectors" - so players may have in-the-fiction reasons for wanting to make money, and along the way, opponents may die. They may have in-the-fiction reasons for wanting to kill people ("he killed my father!") and in doing so, may end up taking their opponents gear (spoils of war has a long, honourable tradition). They may even have goals that are pure ("defend the village from the dark lord's minions"), and once the battle is over, need to do something with all their opponents gear that is now littering the poor village's farmlands.<br><br>Groups may play more like the style lampooned in Knights of the Dinner Table, but it's easy to misinterpret. If you're playing a game that's ostensibly about saving the village, and one player says, "how much will i get for this magic sword I took of my opponent," and seems more excited about that than saving the peasants, I wouldn't be too concerned. Players are capable of holding two ideas in their head at once (maybe more!): the concern at that moment is the sword, but he's also getting some satisfaction from the fictional activities his character is achieving. I'm sure that for a lot of players, the gaining of the sword is validated by the way he gained it. If you took away the menace of the dark lord, and placed down a simple series of skirmishes, and did nothing to personalise the enemies, you could have fun for a while, but I think the emptiness of the experience would provoke most roleplayers to either switch to playing boardgames, or the drive to rolepaly would cause them to find ways of bringing some kind of fictional personalisation into the game. Perhaps by focussing on and creating the fictional details of their own characters, perhaps. (If the game has a rich and crunchy character experience and personalisation system that could substitute - which may be why some D&amp;D groups do indeed play like that.) But I've nevr played in a group like that, so I'm just theorising.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255109/#Comment_255109" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T17:22:53+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  5:22PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should note that I have twice successfully run D&amp;D campaigns in which the characters were basically cops, one serious, one funny.<br><br/>The serious one was set in Daggerdale in the Forgotten Realms during the Zhentish occupation. The characters were militia members who had to keep the peace, solve mysteries, and keep their evil overlords from mashing the populace too much.  They developed contacts with the resistance and lots of nonlethal combat options. Pretty cool stuff.  One thing I remember about it was they were very clear in their own minds about when they would escalate to lethal force.  The way D&amp;D3 worked, it was quite feasible to use lethal force first and then "de-escalate" to knock out the badguys and then stabilize them so they didn't die rather than accidentally wiping them out in a combat.  The other thing I remember was that they made every effort to return stolen property to the people who had lost it, but they could also keep it for themselves if they paid a percentage to their corrupt overseer boss.  This meant they really worked to return stuff and would even give it away "Here, Shelter For Homeless Large Eyed Children, I am returning your 40,000 gold pieces in gems that was stolen from you by Dark Dirk the Bandit." "....er....YES, we misplaced that just the other day."  It was a "serious" game in the sense that the characters were grounded and we advanced levels and so on.<br/><br/>The funny one was Law &amp; Order: Waterdeerp, where they were running around as town guardsmen and arresting people, then playing the "Masked Advocates" that tried the case in court.  It was basically for the lulz.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255271/#Comment_255271" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T17:58:26+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  5:58PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Can you enjoy a game, like say D&amp;D (among others!), in which the execution of violence seems to be the very point baked into the game?"<br/>\n<br/>\nNot anymore. I mean, if it's Dnd and we feel like doing it, we will, but right now we're kinda caught up in "We reduce them to zero HP means we win." And we don't say it's "everyone's dead." I think we've seen straight killing as boring. Bringing people back as re-occurring villains is much more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we do "kill" people, there needs to be a point, a reason, a belief tied to it...all very BWish.<br/>\n<br/>\n"What are your boundaries, if any?"<br/>\n<br/>\nNo children. Ever.<br/>\nNo women being killed 'cause they're women. I see so much of that crap on TV. <br/>\nNo reveling in guts and blood (unless that's the point...you're showing what a creep your guy is).<br/>\nNo sadistic sexual violence (there's a post on BW Arena forums invoking an Orc trait that says you must do something violently sexual when you use it...and it's just wrong. It's the only bit of BW I just flat out say is undoable in my group)<br/>\n<br/>\n"Is it "okay" to just cut loose and make-believe that you're killing shit left and right?"<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe? I don't know. I mean, if some people enjoy it, OK. I'm all about seeing a point behind it. <br/>\n<br/>\n"If so, how is that "okay" but cutting loose and playing make-believe about other forms of violence (rape, emotional abuse, socioeconomic injustice, whatever) not-okay?"<br/>\n<br/>\nJust got done with a Diaspora Mini-Game that involved the seduction of a mob boss's wife. In the end, she resists and she was seduced any-way. Was it rape? Dunno. Felt more like a "Stellaaaaaaaaaa!" moment from Streetcare Named Desire...but it was a little strange. We both looked at each other and said, "huh," and then I said, "Well, I guess I've played games where people unreflectively say they're tearing the guts out of a dead orc and no one batted an eyelash...sooooo...."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255288/#Comment_255288" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-06T00:55:16+00:00" title="February  6, 2010 12:55AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always assumed in D&amp;D you were killing things that were irredeemably evil, hence the "Evil" descriptor. <br/><br/>If I wanted a game where I could redeem the bad guy, I'd play a different game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255310/#Comment_255310" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-06T10:14:50+00:00" title="February  6, 2010 10:14AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha ha, good point, David.
