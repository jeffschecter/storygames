It makes the problem too big.</p>\n<p>I've considered a solution to that, though: I think Zendo should have a scoring system, where there's a maximum of (say) ten rounds in which to get the answer. After ten rounds, the game ends. The questioner gets one point for every round that goes by, but zero points if no one gets it. The answerer gets as many points as the questioner, unless no one got it, in which case all the answerers get one point and a pat on the shoulder for participating. (Well, really, just to make it a net loss for the questioner.)</p>\n<p>That way, you want them to be hard, but not impossible. And before you think, "Well, why wouldn't I throw the first round to get another point?" remember that someone else might not be so generous, and answering early deprives the questioner of points, too.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, Zendo, despite the name, is really about the Scientific Process, which is a quite different way of exploring your own nervous system than real Zend\u014d.</p>\n<p>Shock:Human Contact is about scien<em>tists</em>, but that's probably not the same thing.

Sometimes I think about it beforehand because I'm often the only person there who <em>can</em> think about it beforehand, and I'll throw out something neat ("The first kid born on Mars comes back to Earth!" is more likely to raise eyebrows than "Alien invasion".)</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>2) Any ideas on best practices for running in a classroom where it's just me and the class?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I think you'd have to hack the crap out of it. So much of the system is to gain buyin, that you'd either have 20-25 kids who have bought in but can't actually contribute, or a refusal to buy in.</p>\n<p>I'm also concerned about the amount of time you'd have to play. The game plays in about 4 hours with four people. More people make it take longer. We'll often play a 3-person game of Human Contact in 4 hours because there's much more detail given at every moment.</p>\n<p>You could maybe have groups that play a character together. They'd make decisions by the Shock: principle: if someone has an idea, it stays, unless; someone says no, unless; someone says yes.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>3) Can the game be run with some prep before hand?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Yeah. That's most of what Human Contact is: it's a carefully devised situation. But it assumes that some number of people will have read it, and that everyone's open to listening to those who have.</p>\n<p>I dunno, man. I'm skeptical that this can work with a whole class at once.</p>\n<p>I can see setting up a Grid, Protags and Antags, and asking the kids what they'd do in a situation. I just think the discussion would be more productive than actually playing the game.</p>\n<p>Abstracting S:HC, maybe you could do some, "OK, you guys are the anthropologists, and you other guys are the locals." Then ask them separately, "What kind of thing do you guys do?" ... and go into the local culture, asking about what they eat, what their music is like, what their religion is like, what their families are like. Simultaneously, do the same process with the anthropologist kids, asking them what their culture does when it learns things from other cultures. Then have them meet and ask each other stuff.</p>\n<p>The point of Human Contact is the validity of all culture, even when that's a paradox, and how to deal with that. Like, what if the anthropologist culture is rich when the local culture is poor? Is it legit for the poor culture to steal stuff from the rich one? Does it screw things up if the anthropologists give stuff to the locals?</p>\n<p>I think this might take the development of a new game, but I'm on that like Piaget in Schemae. I'd love to even publish a thing, if you want to work on it together.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285493/#Comment_285493" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T10:57:30+00:00" title="August 11, 2010 10:57AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>Population biology game applications!?</blockquote> Insofar as microeconomics, like population biology, is normally modeled as a gradient-descent ("hill-climbing") approximation algorithm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285495/#Comment_285495" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T11:07:17+00:00" title="August 11, 2010 11:07AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua,<br/><br/>  Thank you for your input and help!!!

You know the price-production curves that are the first thing they show you in Econ 101? The nice smooth convex curves, with supply and demand lines intersecting all around their boundaries? You can actually compute the efficient levels of production for every level of price in that model, which would be pretty cool if a real market was ever that simple. When you have more than one kind of good competing for a given input, rather than that nice smooth curve, you get a complex curve in many dimensions, with many local maxima, each of which is a point at which price and production can efficiently come into equilibrium. But actually finding those maxima is a complex process, because if I (following some market information I've discovered) start consuming more foobar to make more widgets and drive up the foobar price, then maybe that reduces the number of splotches that can be efficiently made (since they also require foobars), and since splotch demand correlates with widget demand, we find we've overshot the equilibrium and need to adjust again... the curve can actually change shape as the market dynamic changes, too, and generally speaking it would be intractable to find the maxima analytically anyway. What to do?<br/><br/>Fortunately, it turns out that approximating the maxima in very complex high-dimensional curves is pretty easy as long as you're willing to do some failing along the way. Suppose that you sort of randomly plunk yourself down on the curve, measure your "altitude", take a step in a random direction and measure again, step back to your starting point, take a step in a random direction and measure yet again, and repeat a few times. You'd get a sense of which of your random steps took you "uphill" the most. Then you'd take a step in that direction and start the process again, slowly climbing this very complex hill, and eventually you'd get to the local max height (within an error of about your step size - and in fact most methods in this family reduce step sizes as time goes on to speed convergence while minimizing final error).<br/><br/>So: The many producing firms are each sampling a slightly different mix of inputs and price around the "market price" at any given time. Some of them will probably have "climbed the hill" a little and will be rewarded with profit. The market moves toward them and everyone changes their prices (or goes out of business, or enters the market fresh) and starts the process again. Prices go toward marginal costs, and production goes toward the maximum efficient level.<br/><br/>But cooler: A given organism reproduces a few times, with each offspring being a little different, in a random, different way. Some of them might be a little fitter than their parent, and they'll be rewarded with more of their own offspring. Essentially, they become the "center step" of a larger exploratory effort at that time. Generations go by and fitness generally increases, powered by the (relatively) childless deaths of unfit organisms.<br/><br/>And thus does microeconomics resemble population biology, and also thermodynamic processes, and indeed a wide variety of methods used to numerically approximate really complex functions in general. They go under the name "gradient descent" because we usually think of them as minimizing the "error function" - going down the hill of a function characterizing the difference between a result we have and one we want in some sense - rather than going uphill to maximize the underlying function value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285795/#Comment_285795" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T10:03:53+00:00" title="August 12, 2010 10:03AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ccreitz,<br/><br/>  Thank you for taking the time to explain all that!!<br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
