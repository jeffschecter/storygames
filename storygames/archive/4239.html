Don't worry, I won't go on as much.<br/>My gaming history is pretty traditional, and the same goes for the couple other people I usually play with.<br/>I want to start playing more "indie" and "story" games.  We've tried a couple, and they haven't gone as well as I'd hoped.  I think one of the problems are the habits we have all gotten in from more "traditional" "mainstream" games, especially regarding the GM/Player divide, and I wanted to know if anyone had any suggestions for trying to transition into more the more story-focused, narrative-focused, player-empowered kinds of story games.  Currently my tactic is essentially "keep playing them until it works" and I think this might work, eventually, but it would be cool if I could make it a smoother journey.  Fortunately, the two people I do most of my gaming with are almost always willing to try anything, even if it isn't a theme or setting that really grabs them, so I've got that advantage if I do keep on my current path...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94915/#Comment_94915" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T19:57:47+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  7:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Brian,<br/><br/>I've read both of your posts.

Burning Wheel was the first step away from traditional games and it's really not that far off.  But the little devices for player empowerment force the referee to re-evaluate his role and put the onus on the players to pick up the slack.  We used Universalis in a constrained role to develop the setting for that game, and that gave us experience with the GM-less storytelling idea without diving straight in to a story -- we had external constraints and purpose that made it more comfortable for us.<br/><br/>Since then the barriers are pretty much down.  Everyone is champing at the bit to GM some Fate based games and we've run some more daring stuff with Polaris, Shock, Carry, Capes, and so on.  We still find that the GM role is important for long running games, but we are comfortable rotating the GM every session in some cases.  Most importantly we find that games that diverge from the traditional in really strong ways no longer provide the stilted result that they might otherwise have -- everyone is prepared to grab the narrative authority and run with it.  In some cases it has democratised our traditional gaming by side effect -- the old authority balance is no longer accepted unspoken.<br/><br/>I'd say the order in which we tried these things was simple luck and I don't know (because I only have one test group) whether a different order would be better or worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94917/#Comment_94917" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T20:05:38+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  8:05PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 8:07PM by fnord3125.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>First, you made a passing comment in the other thread about your friend who isn't ready -- YET -- to just play any rpg just cause it's a chance to play an RPG.

I'll try almost any game at least once.  Especially if it has A) a cool setting or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> interesting mechanics.  Contenders is a great example (and one of the games I'll bring up for part 2) I have no interest in stories about boxers.  I'm not a fan of boxing.  I've never watched any boxing movies.  But I heard a lot of good things about the game and I was intrigued.  So I bought it, I like what I read and I tried it with my friends.  My friend mentioned in the other thread, well, she is definitely not like me in that way.<br/><br/>Part two.  Of the large number of "indie" games I've been acquiring over the last year, I've only really tried out Contenders and Dogs in the Vineyard.  Contenders didn't go well.  Dogs was okay, but not fantastic.  Both of them were only played for one session, and I'm interested in trying both of them (especially Dogs) again.  I will go into more detail about what I felt did not go will with both them and my theories about why, but not tonight.  I've got to get up early tomorrow, so it's almost bedtime.<br/><br/><i>edit: added the quote for ease of reading</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94918/#Comment_94918" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T20:13:47+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  8:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a certain irony in trying unilaterally "transition" people into a player-empowered game, isn't there?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94942/#Comment_94942" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T22:42:17+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 10:42PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>There is a certain irony in trying unilaterally "transition" people into a player-empowered game, isn't there?</blockquote>\nHow so?

Burning Empires? Hell yes. BW? Not so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience with "traditional" (or, and let me add a what-the-fuck EVAR to *that* moniker, since there's so much variety in them it's an almost useless descriptor) groups is that if they're friends, there's no need to use training wheels, transitions or anything else. Comprehension is not a barrier; trust is. That has to work both ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I ran Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries with my group (well, my main one), there was no resistance to it at all, despite the fact that we've been playing D&amp;D; and WoD in alternating games for years now. They know me, trust me and got a look at the game. It was easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, we don't play Sorcerer because I suggested people give it a look, they did and they thought it'd be a waste of time. That's another insight: games  do not come in blocs. They have individual values.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other main barrier is technical, in that people don't want to make a bi pre-play time commitment (character creation, story design, etc.) to a game they're not sure of.

I've had more than a few people on the forums for whom Burning Wheel is the first non D&amp;D role-playing game after 20 or 30+ years in the hobby.  Their groups are generally very into the game, but struggle with the player-empowerment portions of it -- particularly stuff like the Wise skills or Circles. <br><br>They generally need a fair bit of hand holding through those portions of the game, not because they aren't explained in the text but because those ideas are completely outside their frame of reference. It scares them when powers that are generally held only by the GM are shared out among the players as well.<br><br>I remember one group was made very nervous about the idea that the players got to pick their own goals and were expected to be proactive in choosing how to pursue those goals. For them, role-playing games had always involved the GM presenting his plot and fighting the monsters that he put in front of them when they went where he led them.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95022/#Comment_95022" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T08:35:11+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  8:35AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're seeing more agenda in people's intent than is actually there, Malcolm.

In other games, there are less formal but nevertheless important channels as well, but they don't easily collapse into have and have-not dichotomies.<br/><br/>The failure of popular RPGs has been in not examining these soberly and poviding advice in the form of set techniques.

Um.<br/>1) I want to thank everyone that has actually offered me advice or things to think about regarding my question.  You guys rock.<br/>2) I am actually feeling like running away from the discussion I started because of the crazy argument it has turned into for reasons I don't fully comprehend.<br/>3) If anyone is annoyed or bothered by my using quotation marks around the word "traditional," well you might take note that I've taken to also doing the same thing when I say "indie."  I do so not to belittle either of these categories (if you believe the categories actually exist) but because I, like many others, feel the terms are probably not very appropriate, but I don't want to argue about what a better word would be.<br/>4) I'm not trying to "convert" anyone or "force" anyone to play the games I want to play.  I only have 2 people that I regularly game with, and they're both very easy going and willing to try new things.  I am requesting help and advice not about trying to somehow get people to play and like games that they're against, but more because all three of us (myself included, mind you) have developed certain habits from playing "traditional" games, and these habits often make for rocky starts in "indie" or story games or whatever you want to call them.  or at least they've made for rocky starts with me and my group.<br/>5) In the case of my group there is one guy "bringing the Word" to others because while all three of us really enjoy rpgs and even all went to Gen Con together this year, I'm the only one who loves them so much that he feels they are worth his real cash money to buy and his time to read and study and learn.  If it wasn't for me, we'd probably quit playing rpgs entirely.  Like I said, my friends all really enjoy them, but they don't dig them so much they're going to take the time or money to bring them to the group.  Hence, I'm the one who generally GMs games and I'm the one who says, "Hey, I've been checking out this new thing, want to try it?"<br/>6) Again, what I'd love advice on, more than anything else, is for breaking out of old habits.  In the games we've played int he past, the standard structure was for me, as GM, to say, "Here's the situation.  Now what do you guys do?"  It's like a text adventure.  I describe the room, and events, and the players react to them.  When we try to play something like Contenders, and EVERYONE has to frame scenes on their own, and create conflict and antagonism for the other characters, we all kind of get just a little confused.  We understand, intellectually, what it's all about, but because of old habits, it doesn't always work that well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95178/#Comment_95178" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T12:24:07+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 12:24PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow Brian, I totally misunderstood you.

It feels more like a party game and the fact that everyone participates with equal authority makes more sense in that context.  Or at least there are fewer conceptual hurdles to get past.  That is, we weren't playing D&amp;D with new rules but rather playing a wholely different game.<br/><br/>With a few games of Universalis under our belts the idea of farming authority out around the table was not such a big deal and, as I think I pointed out previously, became a concept that we wanted to weave into games that don't explicitly allow for it.  Part of that is dependent on the players of course -- there are plenty of players that just don't want to be that much a part of the story telling, and for them this is not necessarily ever going to be comfortable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95219/#Comment_95219" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T13:58:33+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  1:58PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Wow Brian, I totally misunderstood you.

Currently my tactic is essentially "keep playing them until it works" and I think this might work, eventually, but it would be cool if I could make it a smoother journey.</blockquote>\nFirst of all, you should give up on considering the transition inevitable. Most traditional gamers have already got the awesome, and in many cases, so-called player empowerment will just take their awesome away from them. They won't like that.<br/><br/>Figure out what your players are looking for in the games you play and make sure you're on the same page. If you are, Halfjack's advice is spot on \xe2\u20ac\u201c go for the games that bear the least resemblance to traditional games.

Equally, some Indie games can be railroaded plotfests sometimes with added illusionism.  That split isn't indie/trad driven.<br/><br/>That aside, are you trying to pitch a style of gaming or actual games?<br/><br/>Assuming the latter, honesty works.  Say why you want to run it and why you think it will work better than an existing game.  Simple as that.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't sell as part of a philosophy, that never sounds fun, sell it purely on its own merits as a fun game.  I won't play a game for its design philosophy, but I will if it sounds like playing it will be fun.<br/><br/>Lastly, tastes vary.  I've played a fair few indie games and tend to find trad more consistently rewarding for me.  That's not fear, just different tastes.  No game or style of gaming will be loved by everyone.  Odds are some of your friends will try indie but not like it as much.  People's tastes vary.  Hopefully though some will like it as much as you.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95264/#Comment_95264" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T15:52:50+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  3:52PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 4:08PM by D-503.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To add, you can't drift trad gamers into indie, trying can actually really backfire as you often just end up with a muddled trad game.<br/><br/>Instead, as others have said, dive in with something more extreme.  Polaris say (edit - I missed you were considering Polaris, give it a try), I'd love to try that as it does something genuinely different to the trad games I love.

I've seen players that are new to indie games struggle with it for a bit, and then the light starts to go on. The games demand you to use different creative muscles than your used to. The first thing to do is recognize that fact and dont get too hung up on it.\n<blockquote>6) Again, what I'd love advice on, more than anything else, is for breaking out of old habits. In the games we've played int he past, the standard structure was for me, as GM, to say, "Here's the situation. Now what do you guys do?" It's like a text adventure. I describe the room, and events, and the players react to them. When we try to play something like Contenders, and EVERYONE has to frame scenes on their own, and create conflict and antagonism for the other characters, we all kind of get just a little confused. We understand, intellectually, what it's all about, but because of old habits, it doesn't always work that well.</blockquote>\nSome good things I've seen GMs do when they catch themselves describing too many scenes is to say "No...you tell me what that looks like" and punt it back to the player. Whatever they narrate, unless its completely inane, should get a positive response. From there you can ask questions or make suggestions about anything that you was less than awesome or unclear. So they narrate; you respond "Awesome! Does that mean you're standing over here? What if you were here when the guy walked in?" If you're comfortable with each other, everyone can chime in with suggestions and ideas. Don't make framing scenes a chore. Make it a fun <big>collaborative</big> excercise. <br/><br/>Another thing I've seen in games with Fate points (and similar) is when I asked the GM if something was in the room, he responded "Spend one of those points and you can tell me what's in the room!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95281/#Comment_95281" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T16:38:38+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  4:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2983" rel="nofollow">the Mountain Witch trick</a>".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
