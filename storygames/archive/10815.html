It's a great party game. 4 of us played for hours last week. Fun! Then I played online. Fuck!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis game is designed to simulate a wrestling match. But when someone prioritizes winning over simulation, the game breaks down fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have different ways to attack. Attacks that do a lot of damage are easy to reverse. Attacks that do a little damage are hard to reverse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo most people only use the attacks that are hard to reverse. They may only do 1/4 the damage of a stronger attack. But that's a small trade off for a guaranteed successful attack. Additionally, because of online lag, low damage attacks become even harder to reverse and high damage attacks become easier to reverse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo online wrestling matches end up looking like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nPunch or kick someone till they fall down. Kick them a lot while they are down till they roll out of the way. While they are getting up, run at them and punch or kick them back down. Repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo wrestling moves. No submissions. No holds. No suplexes. No powerbombs. No slams.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou aren't doing a lot of damage but in time you will win. It's boring. For me at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese flaws exist when you play with friends. But they are less likely to use them. And if they do, you can tell them to stop. Because of social pressure and earned social capitol, usually they will. Not so much online.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect some of this applies to RPGs.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239825/#Comment_239825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T12:42:54+00:00" title="October 30, 2009 12:42PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting because it demonstrates directly how social dynamic "counts" in game playing.  The way I see it in both cases the purpose of play is exactly the same.  In both cases the activity is about winning.  However, what's changed between the two examples is the *win conditions*.  Online the only thing that matters is the in-game score board.  Did I beat you by the rules of the game hand?  Yes/No.  In the social environment *style* becomes part of the win condition.  Winning through boring applications of the game rules becomes no win at all.<br><br>Online: Winning = Game Points.<br>Party: Winning = Game Points + Social Points<br><br>And yes, I think this is applicable to RPGs.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239827/#Comment_239827" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T12:52:18+00:00" title="October 30, 2009 12:52PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2009 12:52PM by jenskot.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To build on what you are saying Jesse:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn party play, we often have an audience. People hanging out or waiting for their turn. This is also true in RPGs. And adds more pressure to the value of Winning = Game Points + <b>Social Points</b>.<br/>\n<br/>\nHell, this was true playing Street Fighter 2 in the arcades. You could go for an easy grab attack but everyone would start calling you cheap. Later on they fixed the grab attack (you can trigger a tech hit for less damage or land on your feet). In some ways, the social pressure also acts as a rules patch till official rules patches can be implemented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239851/#Comment_239851" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T15:24:30+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  3:24PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I find some games are better with strangers.

Most of my friends are not scrubs so if we find a game to play competatively we drop it if playing it the best way possible is boring. This is extremely not true to table top RPGs were the fiction counts and there are no clear objectives. You could probably play some games like 3:16 in a play-to-win sort of way but I think it'll be too meta after a while, like if you frag someone at the end of a mission since he had more frags than you and was 1 wound away from death it's a wise move game wise. Holding a grudge against that player should not be part of that game unless you start to count all the meta game social stuff in to the actual game and then it has turned in to some sort of Diplomacy in power armor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239891/#Comment_239891" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T07:08:09+00:00" title="October 31, 2009  7:08AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite><br>Big time.

I play with strangers a lot, because I play Living Forgotten Realms. It's generally fairly smooth partially because the GM is explicitly empowered to do most of the things Alvin cites.<br><br>You do see other places where the social contract has a big influence on D&amp;D play, though. Differing expectations about optimization, differing expectations about skill challenges, and so on. My LFR play has been incredibly informative and has really knocked the scales off my eyes as I've learned more about my own biases.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
