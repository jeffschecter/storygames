I keep on holding on to the the discoveries I've already made, rolling them around in my head and jealously guarding them from other opinions that threaten them.<br/><br/>In my work life we believe in lifelong learning and I believe that ought to be the case with RPGs too but I've not got the culture and peer pressure to back me up.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll ever catch up with some of the clever names in the hobby and on this board because I reckon you probably learn new things at a rate faster than I do.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411351/#Comment_411351" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-05T04:32:35+00:00" title="April  5, 2013  4:32AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2013 4:34AM by Rickard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you asking how many discoveries we have per game (or game per discovery)?<br/><br/>Here's the thing for me. I can only learn if I can relate what I read. I read 1000 pages of LARP theory but I couldn't understand it because I have no relation to LARP. It wasn't until I played <b>Montsegur 1244</b> that I could understand the articles about their kind of immersion.<br/><br/>When it comes to movies, I normally have to watch it twice to remember it. The first time I see it, it's all about the sensation, but the second time I go through the movie I seem to notice more details and take them into consideration. It's the same thing with me and reading games. The first time I read a game, it's all about the sensation. I remember when I was reading through the GM chapter of <a href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#running-the-game" rel="nofollow">Spirit of the Century</a> and I thought it was  an all right reading. It wasn't until the second read, when I started to compare the information I read to my own experiences, that I appreciated that chapter.<br/><br/>So it's hard for me to answer your question. It's a combination of playing a diverse number of games, reading sources of game theory and actually reading roleplaying games. And the roleplaying games that I read is mostly games that people recommended as something special.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411691/#Comment_411691" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T14:23:39+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  2:23PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>and jealously guarding them from other opinions that threaten them.</blockquote>\nWhat?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411696/#Comment_411696" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T15:11:41+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  3:11PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, other opinions doesn't threat my own, they either illustrate me into new knowdelge or reveal as utterly false in the light of my experience. Don't be afraid of doubt, since questioning ourselves actually makes our principles stronger.<br/><br/>Of course, you will still need some force of will to not run after every thing that shines under the sun, but reading other games, playing them and reading how other people plays the same games has inspired me to create new things. Even cheking into stuff I don't like makes me think about what exactly I dislike of it and whether it's a rational reaction or an emotional one from my side. BTW, lifelong learning actually means 10,000 hours or 7 years more or less, of learning and practice required to be skillful at something, followed by constant practice and actualization. Just ponted it out because the term always look more daunting than it actually is to achieve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
