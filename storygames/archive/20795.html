I think I have the core mechanics to a workable level, but that seems really hard to know without actual play testing.  This is the first game I've really been excited enough about to attempt to finish it, so I'm kind of shooting in the dark on this whole thing.<br/><br/>For this first test, I mainly want to test the mechanics to make sure they're accessible and lead to interesting choices for the player, what Eero called "Explorative" playtesting:\n<blockquote><b>Explorative </b>playtest is when you have some ideas for a game and glue them quickly together to give them a whirl in real conditions, and brainstorm with the group on the flight to see whether there might be something interesting there. Later on you use explorative playtesting to expand upon concepts and explore their implications.</blockquote>\nI'm thinking about doing the following:\n<ol>\n<ul>Create a few one-page handouts for the players:  setting intro, rules of play, how to make a character, and example of play</ul>\n<ul>Create and print a few characters sheets</ul>\n<ul>Make a starter scenario (a couple hours of play at most)</ul>\n<ul>Create a Google Form for anonymous feedback</ul>\n</ol>\nI'd like to run the test with 4 players in a single evening that leads them through: character creation, actual play, and an end-of-session Q&amp;A (with specific questions about what worked, what was understandable, etc.).<br/><br/>For those of you who have done this sort of thing before, is there anything blatant that I'm missing or other considerations you can think of that might help make the test more useful?<br/><br/>Thanks for any insight,<br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456565/#Comment_456565" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-25T16:21:34+00:00" title="September 25, 2016  4:21PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2016 7:52AM by Rickard.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For character generation.

Fix it for the next playtest.<br/><br/>Write the scenario to playtest ONE thing: to try a subsystem, to see how development works, to see what certain kind of characters do to the game, etc.<br/><br/>You said you've been writing on this game for a while. Explorative playtest seems to me be more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design" rel="nofollow">iteration design</a>, where you create a core and then playtest it as early as you can, and then add more and more elements to it. That's kinda how I create games, where I leave a lot of things out (like skill descriptions) so the players can interpret them during play. When I done playtesting (usually after a year), I sit down to actually write the game by just using all the experience I gathered through all the playtests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456566/#Comment_456566" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-25T16:57:43+00:00" title="September 25, 2016  4:57PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my opinion:<br/><br/>The feedback form is an overblown technique for this sort of playtesting. To begin with, your most important feedback from an early playtest like this is the actual play, not the opinions of amateurs. Furthermore, you do not have a) sufficient theoretical basis for asking the right questions (this is because you've yet to play the game even once, not because of any cognitive fault), b) sufficient tester population to conduct a survey, or c) a need for customer satisfaction testing at this early stage.<br/><br/>In general I recommend focusing on your own impression of the game for this kind of alpha playtest; you are not there to seek affirmation from others for your game (or if you are, we'll need to figure out some different techniques), but rather to see if it works together the way you thought it would. For this purpose the first and foremost thing you need for a successful playtest is a clear vision of what your game is supposed to accomplish, and how; you are testing whether <i>this</i> happens as you play. It's not an opinion proffered by somebody else at the table, it's pure fact of creative endeavour; you need to observe your play and decide whether the game is working, and whether the particulars of fortune, the specific play group or other things are influencing the exercise. Often enough the only thing I take back from this kind of first playtest is that I personally enjoyed the exercise; that suffices, it proves that there is a game in here waiting to get out.<br/><br/>Also, this being explorative playtesting, you want to keep your eyes open for better ways of doing things: you'll find that some of your armchair speculation (also known as "rules text") is counter-productive at the actual table, so you scrap it in the flight, and maybe replace it with some placeholder to continue play. Later on you'll realize that you lack a game component that would be interesting and fruitful in this particular situation that came up. You'll make notes of these observations, and later on refine your game text on the basis of the discoveries you made while playing.<br/><br/>I also want to specifically note that usually it is not useful to pay too much attention to usability issues in an alpha stage playtest, particularly one with an exploratory motivation. Obviously the players will tell you if they don't understand something, or if they strongly dislike something about the rules, but considering how the game will still change in its particulars, and you haven't yet written anything close to a final game text, it is far too early to try to seek usability feedback. You should rather focus on whether the players "felt" the creative agenda and were inspired by it - whether the gameplay was meaningful and interesting to them. The particulars of the form will come later.<br/><br/>Rickard's suggestions sound to me like something you'd do for mid- to late-stage playtesting. They may be relevant, depending upon how finished the game is. If your description (no playtest so far, and you're uncertain as to how well it functions in the field) holds true, odds are that you don't want to formalize the playtest too much - just get that first test underway, make notes of what crashes in play, and fix afterwards. Too much prep runs the danger of testing irrelevant details while the big picture is still uncertain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456568/#Comment_456568" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-25T18:35:58+00:00" title="September 25, 2016  6:35PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I mainly want to test the mechanics to make sure they're accessible and lead to interesting choices for the player</blockquote>Running a demo session can be a fun way to test this and much more.  I want to mention, though, that if "Do these mechanics lead to interesting choices?" were your <i>only</i> concern right this second, grabbing one friend for fifteen minutes would be plenty useful on that front.  I think that's an under-utilized approach.  If you have any doubts about whether your system is ready for a full, multi-player, multi-hour run, a 15-minute mini test will do a lot to clarify that.<br/><br/>If you decide to try that, I would hand your friend a good character, place them in a typically fun situation that you imagine for this game, and play through the resolution of that immediate situation (escaping the room, defeating the foes, swindling the smugglers, whatever).  Bonus: in my experience, this is a lot eager to organize than a full playtest.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456570/#Comment_456570" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-25T18:49:12+00:00" title="September 25, 2016  6:49PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you do do the full session test, my main recommendation is to make it fun for you, so that it energizes you and keeps you moving forward on the project.  <br/><br/>Getting the impressions of amateurs, even if useless for a given design challenge, can be good for inspiring conversation and brainstorming.

Should be just about the first lesson in any culture industry lesson plan, in fact. Life would be just so much easier, and work more productive, if we could be honest to each other without exploding at disappointments. The anger simply does no work, it's something one has to cut out so a person is capable of being criticized.<br/><br/>Also, think twice before engaging in a defensive dialogue, even if you are being entirely calm and friendly. It is very, <i>very</i> easy to habitually answer negative feedback with a defensive explanation, even when the resulting debate is both boring and socially hazardous. Partially this is because the rules of conversation have trained us to deliver; in many circumstances it is rude to refuse to engage a discussion. When receiving critique, however, you should remember that you are not there to win a debate with your critic. Often the best answer to a critique is to acknowledge it, repeat it in your own words to make sure you understand their viewpoint, and promise to take it under consideration; this way you have engaged the critique socially without getting into a debate about its quality. The last thing you want to do is rewarding a critique with a sharp retort that questions the intelligence of the critic - who would want to work with you, if that is how you reward their interest and goodwill in bothering to take a look at your project?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456597/#Comment_456597" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-26T04:43:24+00:00" title="September 26, 2016  4:43AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make the playtest scenario engaging and enjoyable on its own.

Write down what they say instead, and take a stance later if it's relevant or not.<br/><br/>The thing is, there are four kinds of feedback:\n<ol><li><i>Short judgments</i>. "I didn't like this."</li><li><i>Personal preferences.</i> "I don't like to roll attributes."</li><li><i>Corrections.</i> "It says d8 here but we only rolled d6s."</li><li><i>Improvements</i>. "It would be good if this were on the character sheet."</li></ol>\nIt might seem like the last two are the kinds of feedback that you want, but the the first kind of feedback says something about your target audience, and the second kind tells you that you haven't made it clear why a certain mechanic exist in your game. Always follow up with questions if you get someone that gives judgments or preferences so you better understand where they come from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456600/#Comment_456600" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-26T07:52:00+00:00" title="September 26, 2016  7:52AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Make the playtest scenario engaging and enjoyable on its own.

Then people are more inclined to accept if it's not funny, and they are more open to give feedback.<br/><br/>If you rely too much on the scenario or on your own game master skills, then it can hide how the system works. You want to playtest, and if you have a good time too, well, then it's certainly a good sign that you're on the right path.<br/><br/>Oh, and boardgamers are great playtesters. They have a tendency to analyze and discuss the game('s strategies) afterwards after each game, and they will probably do the same with yours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20H" title="John H"><img alt="John H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20H">John H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458759/#Comment_458759" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-19T15:40:59+00:00" title="December 19, 2016  3:40PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't really want to necro a thread, but I wanted to say thanks for all your help.  <br/><br/>I've gone through one playtest and got a lot of good feedback.
